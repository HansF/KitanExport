つめた。
　私は、つと目をそらして、疊の上に大事そうに置かれた小さゝ藥包みを取り上げると、
「フンこれがあつぎの婆アが置いて行つた支那から傳來の高貴薬とか云う化物だな。この粉末を二十二才の処女の尿に溶かして、それを四十分煮てから飲むのか。馬鹿な。喜劇だ。君が僕に頼みたいつてのは、その二十二才の処女の尿を僕にとつて来いって云うんだろ、どうだ。図星だろフフフ、、」
「うん、そうなんだ。」
「質平御免だよそんな馬鹿なことそれより僕は今から醫者を呼んでくる医者を」
　私は、そう言つて立ち上りかけた。
「ま、まつてくれ。な、お、お願いだこの俺の頼みを聞いてくれ。な、頼む」
　刈田は、蒲団から、からだをのり出して私の手を弱々しく掴んだ。
　私は、これ以上病人に逆らつては、却つてからだを悪くしてしまうばかりだと思つたので、叉坐りなおした。
「ねえ、刈田、宗教では病気は治らないんだ。この文明が発達した世の中に君は科学を醫学を否定するのか。まさか否定は、していないだろう。君は神がそれ以上のものと信じているだけなんだね。君は間違っている。君の病氣は、醫者だけが治すことが出来るんだ」
　刈田は、聞いているのかいないのかじつと目を閉じたまゝ動こうとしなかつた。

　私は、もう醫者を呼びに行く事を諦めた。こんなに強く信じ切つた彼を見ていると、ひょつとしたらその精神力で病魔を克服する事が出来るかも知れないと云う錯覚に陥入つた。
　刈田は、静かに目を開けると、
「お願いだ、頼む」
と、もう一度言つた。
　私は、彼の熱心さには負けて、その奇妙な願いを引き受けることになつた。
　それには、いくらか私の好奇心も働いていたのであるが……。

三、
　さて、私は、この前代未聞の世にも珍奇な彼の願いを引き受けてしまつたものの、どうしたらいいのか迷わずにはおれなかつた。
　それには、まず二十二才で処女であると云うその條件にかなつた女性を探さなければならない。
　二十二才の女性は、いくらでもはき捨てる程いるが、さてその女性が処女であるかどうか、こんなに若い娘の貞操觀念の稀薄になつた時代であるから分かつたものではない。
　私は、歸りの市電の中で、心あたりの女性を順々に思い浮かべたが、どれもこれもその條件にかなつた女性はいなかつた。
　私が全く思案にくれていた時、私の頭にさつと電光のように閉めぬいたものがあつた。
　―利根須磨子！
　そうだ、彼女は確か二十二才で嫁入り前の箱入りだ。だが、彼女と私とは決して親しい間柄ではないのだ。
　たゞ、彼女が私の家の近所に住んでいると云う關係で、道で会つた時などに軽く挨拶する程度なのだ。
　でも、彼女を差しおいてこの適任者は他に居そうにもない。
　そこで私は、勝手に適任者を彼女ときめてしまつた。さて、そこまでは決まつたとしても、これから後が大変だ。
　まさか彼女に、あなたのオシッコを下さいなんて言えたものではない。そ

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Chilled.
I, quickly averted eyes, and from on top of the tatami mat, picked up a small medicine packet placed importantly,
"Hmph, so this is that 'noble medicine' handed down from China that the old hag left just now, or some such monster. Dissolve this powder in the urine of a twenty-two-year-old virgin, boil it for forty minutes, then drink? Idiotic. It's a comedy. What you want to ask of me is to go and get the urine of that twenty-two-year-old virgin, isn't it? How about it. Bullseye, right? Heh heh heh..."
"Yeah, that's right."
"I absolutely refuse such an idiotic thing. More than that, I’m going now to call a doctor, a doctor."
I, saying so, started to stand up.
"Wait, wait. Please, I beg you, listen to this request of mine. Please, I beg."
Karita, from the futon, leaned his body out and weakly grabbed my hand.
I, thinking that opposing the sick person any further would only make his body worse, sat back down.
"Hey, Karita, diseases aren't cured by religion. In this world where civilization has developed, are you denying science, denying medicine? Surely you aren't denying it. You just believe in God or something beyond that, don't you? You are wrong. Your illness is something only a doctor can cure."
Karita, whether he was listening or not, kept his eyes closed still and did not try to move.

I already gave up on going to call a doctor. Looking at him who believed so strongly, I fell into the illusion that perhaps with that mental power he might be able to overcome the sickness demon.
Karita, quietly opening his eyes, 
"Please, I beg,"
he said once more.
I, losing to his earnestness, ended up accepting that strange request.
In that, my curiosity was also working somewhat, but...

III.
Now, although I had ended up accepting this unheard-of and world-rare strange request of his, I couldn't help but be lost as to what to do.
For that, first, a woman who meets that condition of being twenty-two years old and a virgin must be found.
Twenty-two-year-old women, there are as many as you could sweep and discard, but as for whether that woman is a virgin or not, in an era where the concept of chastity in such young girls has become thin, it is not something one could know.
I, inside the returning city tram, called to mind women I knew one by one, but there wasn't a single woman who met those conditions.
When I was completely lost in thought, something flashed through my head like a lightning bolt.
—Tone Sumako!
That's right, she is certainly twenty-two and a sheltered girl before marriage. But, she and I are by no means on close terms.
It’s just that, because of the relationship of her living in the neighborhood of my house, it's to the extent of lightly greeting her when meeting on the street or such.
But, setting her aside, there seems to be no other suitable person.
Thereupon I, on my own, decided on her as the suitable person. Now, even if that much was decided, what comes after is the hard part.
It's not as if I could say to her, "Please give me your pee." Th...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The room felt cold.
I looked away and picked up the small medicine packet that had been placed so carefully on the tatami. "Hmph," I snorted, "so this is that 'miracle cure from China' the old woman left behind—some kind of monstrosity. You’re supposed to dissolve this powder in the urine of a twenty-two-year-old virgin, boil it for forty minutes, and then drink it? This is absurd. It’s a farce. What you’re asking me is to go out and procure the urine of a twenty-two-year-old virgin for you, isn’t it? Am I right? Heh, bullseye."

"Yes," he replied. "That’s it."

"I absolutely refuse to be part of such idiocy. Forget this—I’m going to call a doctor."
I made a move to stand up.

"Wait—please! I’m begging you. Just listen to me. Please," Karita pleaded, leaning out from his futon to weakly grasp my hand.

Realizing that agitating the patient any further would only worsen his condition, I sat back down. "Look, Karita, religion doesn't cure disease. In this age of modern civilization, are you really denying science? Denying medicine? I'm sure you aren't. You just want to believe in God or some higher power. But you’re wrong. Only a doctor can cure what’s wrong with you."

Whether Karita heard me or not, I couldn't tell; he simply kept his eyes shut and remained motionless.

I gave up on the idea of calling a doctor. Watching him, so utterly consumed by his belief, I fell into the brief delusion that perhaps his sheer willpower alone might conquer the illness. 

Karita opened his eyes slowly. "Please. I'm begging you."
I finally succumbed to his desperation and agreed to take on his bizarre request. To be honest, a certain degree of curiosity was also pulling at me...

III.
Now, having accepted a request so unheard of and bizarre, I found myself utterly at a loss. First, I had to find a woman who met the criteria: twenty-two years old and a virgin. 

While twenty-two-year-old women were a dime a dozen, determining their virginity was another matter entirely—especially in these times, when the very notion of chastity among young women had become so flimsy. 

Riding home on the city tram, I cycled through every woman I knew, but not one seemed to fit the bill. Just as I was about to give up in despair, a name struck me like a bolt of lightning.

*Tone Sumako!*

That was it. She was certainly twenty-two, a sheltered girl from a good family, and still unmarried. The problem was, we weren't close. We lived in the same neighborhood, but our relationship was limited to the occasional polite greeting on the street. 

Still, I couldn't think of anyone else more suitable. Right then and there, I decided she was the one. But even having made that choice, the real ordeal lay ahead. 

It wasn't as if I could just walk up to her and say, "Excuse me, may I have some of your urine?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is formatted in traditional Japanese vertical columns (tategaki), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface typical of mid-century Japanese printing. The title/author section at the bottom is in a stylized, bolder typeface.
*   **Visual Elements:** There is a striking line-art illustration (woodcut or ink style) in the center. It depicts a man lying in bed (presumably the sick Karita) with a worried or calculating expression, while the narrator/protagonist looks on. The style is somewhat "Gekiga-adjacent," common in mystery/adult magazines of the era.
*   **Division:** The text includes a section marker "三、" (Three), indicating the start of a new chapter or scene.
*   **Footer:** The page number "—57—" is centered at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Based on the orthography (using "薬" as "藥", "気" as "氣") and the mention of "Shina" (支那) for China, this text likely dates to the late 1940s or early 1950s. The term *Shina* became officially discouraged in Japan after 1946, but persisted in literature and common parlance for years.
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** This story falls into the "Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense" genre, which flourished in the pre-war period and saw a resurgence in post-war "pulp" magazines (*kasutori zasshi*). The plot involves a bizarre medical fetish (virgin urine as medicine).
*   **Folk Medicine vs. Modernity:** The dialogue highlights the tension between traditional "miracle cures" (often associated with China or religious superstition) and modern Western medicine/science, a common theme in Japanese literature during the modernization period.
*   **Chastity (貞操観念):** The narrator notes that "chastity has become thin" in the modern era, reflecting post-war social anxieties about changing moral standards and Western influence on Japanese youth.
*   **City Tram (市電):** A common mode of urban transport in the mid-20th century, serving as a classic setting for a character's internal monologue.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **高貴薬 (Kōkiyaku):** Literally "noble medicine." Traditionally referred to rare, expensive, and allegedly powerful medicines, often of Chinese origin (like ginseng or animal parts).
*   **図星 (Zuboshi):** Bullseye; hitting the mark.
*   **真っ平御免 (Mappira-gomen):** An emphatic "No thank you" or "I absolutely refuse."
*   **箱入り (Hakoiri):** Short for *hakoiri-musume* (a girl in a box), meaning a sheltered, well-bred young lady.
*   **市電 (Shiden):** Municipal tram/streetcar.
*   **支那 (Shina):** An archaic/historical term for China. In a post-war context, it often carries a nuance of "the mysterious, old continent" where exotic medicines come from.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Science vs. Superstition:** The protagonist acts as the voice of reason ("this civilization has developed"), while the sick Karita represents the desperation of the dying, who turn to the irrational.
*   **Voyeurism/Taboo:** The quest for "virgin urine" introduces a transgressive, slightly erotic element. The narrator's internal conflict—wanting to help but realizing the social taboo of the request—is used for both dark humor and suspense.
*   **Social Class and Decorum:** The character Sumako is chosen because she is "sheltered" (*hakoiri*), emphasizing that her "purity" is a social and physical commodity needed for the cure.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Mystery/Drama.
*   **Genre:** Ero-Guro (Erotic Grotesque), Pulp Fiction.
*   **Tags:** Superstition, Modernization, Medicine, Fetishism, Showa Era, Urban Life.
