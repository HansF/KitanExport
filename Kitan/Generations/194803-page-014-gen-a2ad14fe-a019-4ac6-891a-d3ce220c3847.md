## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

時でした。此の頃に早く止めておけば今の様な状態にならなくて済んだのでしょうが、ただ、一度その愉快さを覺えた私は、もう阿片に中毒した患者のように、一歩一歩だん〜と深味へはまってゆくのでした。
そして夜ともなれば、何かに目に見えない大きな力に、綱で引きづられるように、梯子を降りてゆく私でした。若し晝間の私を知っている人がその姿を眺めたならば發狂したのではないかと驚くことだろうと思います。
眞暗な裏通りの街を歩いたり、地下道に巣くう浮浪者の群と一緒に寝たり、大阪驛前の芝生の上で、青天井を眺めながら寝ころんで隣の女にお客をとるのをぼんやりと夢の様に網膜の中に映じさせたり、驛の待合室で、闇屋のリュックを運ぶのを手傳ったり。一寸普通人では想像できない行動であった。
天王寺公園の樹立の中を、うろつき廻って、刑事と間違われたのもその頃であった。
だん〜とそんな事位では満足できなくなってきた私の暗異的傾向は今度は變裝と言うことを教えた。
そんな勿論、女形とか、陰間とかうことからヒントを得たことであったが、初め私は此の新しく珍しい思いつきに胸をワク〜させて早速その準備にとりかゝった。
私は背も餘り高くなく小柄で痩形なので、その點は幸であったが、服装の點で中々困った。鏡の前でドーラン白粉を使って女に化けてゆく過程は、私をゾク〜する程喜ばせるものであった。
簡単で安價という點から先づ洋装にすることにして、パーマネントのカヅラを買った。相當高價なものでいたかったが、化粧品のブローカーで儲けた金を、私の變態性の嗜好のために投ずるのは、決して惜しくなかった。
薄暮の頃より一室に閉ぢこもって女になるために一心に研究した。變質的な私には友達と言うものがなかつたので、突然訪ねてくるような人もなく、此んな時は至って便利であった。
今迄男であった者が急に反對の女になってしまうと言うことは、どんなに興味のあることであろうか、これは経験したことのない人は味わう事のできないスリルである。男として遇されておつたものが、一轉して今度は女として、あらゆる人が見てくれる。
私は胸を高鳴らせながら、薄暗い露地へ降り立った。果して女として見てくれるであろうか、見破られはしないだろうか、そんな危惧の念が私を臆病にさせて、明るい電燈の下へはよう立たせなかった。
人の通らない市電の電車道や、焼跡の道を歩き方や身のこなし方に注意しながら歩いてみる。時折りすれ違う人も、別に不思議なと云う気配も見せない。
自信を得た私は、その服装でだん〜盛り場の人込みの中を歩きだした。若い男なんか、ちろっと顔を穴を開くほど見つめられて、見破られたかと思ってハッとすることがあつたが、それは軟派の不良少年かなんかであって、私の女装も見破られずに、漸次型にはまつていった。
人間と云うものは不思議なもので、恰好が、女になってしまえば、自然心の持ち様や態度も女らしくなってくるものであつて、私も自分で意識せずに驚くことがあった。
毎夜、女装して歩くと言ふのは、私の第二期的な症状であったでしょう。それが遂に第三期的症状に陥ちこんで只今のような變態的な生活に溺れきってしまう様になったのである。私のような年齢であれば、普通では妻帯もし子供の一人や二人は出来ている筈ですのに、未だに、こうしてアパートの一人住居で、夢遊病的の浮草生活を續けてゐるのです。
然しこれは、正常な人から考えれば至って馬鹿げた話であり、愚の骨頂であるのは尤もなのですが、そこには又私の様な變態病患者には常識で判断することの出来ないところがあるものなのだ。
こうゆう事になったキッカケと云うのは、もう秋口に入った或る月の美しい晩でした。私は上六交叉點から日本橋一丁目へ下ろうとする電車道で中年の背廣服の男に呼びとめられた。
もうその時分は、女装に對してすつかり自信を持つてゐましたので心配はしませんでしたが、その男が醉いにまかして私を一緒に連れてゆこうとしたのには驚きました。
やがて東の方から流して来たリンタクを呼びとめた彼は無理に私を押しこめたのです、狭い座席に彼と二人で座って、揺られると、妙に私は受動的な衝動にかられるのでした。こんなことは今迄嘗て味わったことのない自分でも合點のいかない気持でした。
彼は曾根崎の或る石鹸工場の主人で、案内されたのは、その店の二階であった。
そこで彼に手を握られた私は、彼から、男でもない、女でもない變態を受けたのでした。それは私が生れて初めて経験した變態病患者としての眞の愉悦であった。その夜より第三期に推移した私の病勢は、日を追うに従って益々熾烈となって、もう今では、どうする事も出来ない位に病勢が進行してしまった。
夕闇が迫る頃ともなれば、變態病は私を誘い出して街へつれ出す、露地から露地へとさまよい歩く女装の私の姿。
こうして夜毎、變態的な刺戟を求ては、その満足を得なければ安眠できない凄まじい私であつた。
だが一度朝ともなれば、真面目なサラリーマンとして、そんな事は一向を知らぬ顔をして出勤してゆくのであった。
夜の私と晝の私も同時に知っている人は、未だ無い筈である。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

It was the time. If at this time I had stopped early, I probably would have ended up not becoming like my current state, but, simply, having once learned that pleasure, I, like a patient addicted to opium, step by step, gradually, was sinking into the depths. 
And when it became night, as if pulled by a rope by some invisible great force, I was [a person] descending a ladder. If a person who knows me during the day were to gaze at that figure, I think they would be surprised and think I had gone mad.
Walking through pitch-black back-alley streets, sleeping with groups of vagrants who nest in underground passages, lying on the grass in front of Osaka Station while gazing at the open sky and vaguely, like a dream, letting the sight of the woman next to me taking customers be reflected in my retinas, or helping carry black-marketers' backpacks in station waiting rooms. It was behavior that ordinary people could not imagine.
It was also around that time that I wandered through the groves of Tennoji Park and was mistaken for a detective.
Gradually, becoming unable to be satisfied by such things, my "dark-strange" tendency this time taught me something called "disguise."
Of course, it was something I got hints from things like *onnagata* (male actors of female roles) or *kagama* (male prostitutes), but at first, I let my heart go pit-a-pat at this new and rare idea and immediately set about the preparations.
Because my height was not very high and I was small and thin, that point was a blessing, but regarding the point of clothing, I was quite troubled. The process of turning into a woman in front of the mirror using greasepaint and white powder was something that made me delighted to the point of shivering.
From the point of being simple and cheap, I first decided on Western clothes and bought a "permanent" [permed] wig. I wanted it to be a considerably high-priced thing, but throwing the money I earned as a cosmetics broker into my "abnormal-natured" hobby was never a source of regret.
From around twilight, I shut myself in a room and researched single-mindedly to become a woman. Because for the "abnormal" me, there was no such thing as a friend, there was no one who would suddenly visit, and such times were extremely convenient.
The fact that one who until now was a man suddenly becomes the opposite, a woman—how interesting a thing that must be; this is a thrill that people who have not experienced it cannot taste. That which was treated as a man, turning around, this time as a woman, all kinds of people look at [me].
While making my heart pound, I stepped down into a dim alley. "Will they really look at me as a woman?" "Won't I be found out?" Such feelings of apprehension made me cowardly and did not let me stand under bright electric lights easily.
I tried walking while paying attention to the way of walking and movement of the body on streetcar paths where people do not pass or on roads of burned ruins. Even people I occasionally pass do not show a sign of particularly thinking it's strange.
Having gained confidence, in that outfit, I gradually began to walk in the crowds of the entertainment districts. With young men, I was stared at so much it was like they were boring holes in my face, and there were times I felt a start thinking I was found out, but those were "soft" delinquent boys or something, and without my cross-dressing being seen through, I gradually settled into the role.
Human beings are strange things; if the appearance becomes a woman, naturally the state of mind and attitude also become womanly, and I myself was sometimes surprised without realizing it.
To walk cross-dressed every night was likely my "second-stage" symptom. That finally fell into "third-stage" symptoms and I came to be completely drowned in an "abnormal" life like the present. If I were at my age, normally I should have married and have one or two children, but still, like this, living alone in an apartment, I am continuing a somnambulistic, floating-weed life.
However, this, if thought about by a normal person, is an extremely foolish story and the height of folly, but there, also, for an "abnormal-disease" patient like me, there are parts that cannot be judged by common sense.
The trigger for things becoming like this was a beautiful night of a certain moon just as autumn had begun. On the streetcar road where I was about to go down from the Ueroku intersection toward Nipponbashi 1-chome, I was called out to by a middle-aged man in a suit.
At that time, since I had complete confidence in my cross-dressing, I was not worried, but I was surprised that the man, leaving it to his drunkenness, tried to take me along with him.
Soon, he called over a *rintaku* (bicycle taxi) that came cruising from the east and forced me into it. Sitting with him, the two of us in the narrow seat, and being shaken, I strangely was driven by a passive impulse. Such a thing was a feeling that even I, who had never tasted it until now, could not make sense of.
He was the master of a certain soap factory in Sonezaki, and the place I was guided to was the second floor of that shop.
There, having my hand grasped by him, I received from him an "abnormality" that was neither man nor woman. That was the first true pleasure I experienced since being born as an "abnormal-disease" patient. My "illness" which shifted to the third stage from that night became more and more intense as the days passed, and now, it has progressed to the point where nothing can be done.
When the time comes that evening darkness approaches, the "abnormal disease" lures me out and takes me to the city—the figure of me cross-dressed, wandering from alley to alley.
In this way, every night, seeking "abnormal" stimulation, I was a fearsome self who could not sleep peacefully without obtaining that satisfaction.
But once it becomes morning, as a serious salaryman, I would go to work with a face that knows nothing of such things.
A person who knows both the nighttime me and the daytime me at the same time, there should not yet be any.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

It began back then. Had I put a stop to it early on, I likely wouldn't be in the state I am today. But once I tasted that particular pleasure, I was like an opium addict, sinking deeper and deeper into the mire with every step.

When night fell, it was as if some invisible, immense force dragged me down a ladder by a rope. If anyone who knew my daytime self had seen me then, they surely would have thought I’d gone mad. I wandered through pitch-black backstreets, slept among the throngs of vagrants huddling in underground passages, or lay on the grass in front of Osaka Station under the open sky, watching the woman beside me solicit customers as if it were a scene reflected in a dream. I even helped black-marketers carry their rucksacks in station waiting rooms. It was a life beyond the imagination of any ordinary person. It was during those days, while prowling the thickets of Tennoji Park, that I was once even mistaken for a plainclothes detective.

Eventually, these simple thrills no longer sufficed. My growing "deviant" tendencies led me toward the idea of disguise. I drew inspiration from the *onnagata* of the stage and the *kagama* of history. The mere thought of this new, rare pursuit made my heart race, and I set to work on the preparations immediately. My small, slender frame was a blessing, but finding the right clothes proved difficult. Yet, the process of transforming into a woman before the mirror using greasepaint and powder filled me with a delight that made my skin crawl with excitement.

For the sake of simplicity and cost, I settled on Western dress and purchased a permed wig. It was quite expensive, but I didn't regret spending the money I’d earned as a cosmetics broker on my "abnormal" tastes. From dusk onward, I would shut myself in my room, devotedly studying how to "become" a woman. Being the deviant sort, I had no friends to drop by unannounced, which proved most convenient.

What an incredible thrill it is for someone who has always been a man to suddenly become the opposite! It is a sensation no one who hasn't experienced it can truly understand. To be treated as a man one moment, then to turn around and have the world look upon you as a woman—it was intoxicating.

With my heart pounding, I stepped out into a dim alleyway. Would they take me for a woman? Would I be exposed? Such fears made me timid, and I found it hard to stand under the bright glare of the streetlamps. I practiced my gait and posture on deserted streetcar tracks and through the paths of the city’s burned-out ruins. The occasional passerby showed no sign of suspicion.

Gaining confidence, I began to venture into the crowds of the entertainment districts in full dress. Young men would sometimes stare so intently it felt like they were boring holes in me; my heart would leap, thinking I’d been found out, but they were just "soft" delinquents on the prowl. My disguise held, and I gradually settled into the role. It is a strange thing: once the appearance becomes feminine, the heart and mannerisms naturally follow. I often surprised myself with how effortlessly I adopted a womanly air.

Walking the streets in drag every night became what I might call my "second-stage" symptom. Eventually, it worsened into a "third-stage" condition, and I became utterly submerged in this deviant lifestyle. At my age, I should normally have a wife and a child or two, but here I am, living alone in an apartment, leading the somnambulistic life of a drifter. To a "normal" person, this must seem like the height of folly, and perhaps it is. But for a "patient" afflicted with this abnormal disease, there are things that common sense simply cannot judge.

The turning point occurred on a beautiful moonlit night at the beginning of autumn. I was on the streetcar road heading down from the Ueroku intersection toward Nipponbashi when a middle-aged man in a suit called out to me. By then, I was so confident in my disguise that I wasn't worried, but I was startled when the man, emboldened by drink, tried to take me away with him. He hailed a *rintaku*—a bicycle taxi—and forced me inside. As we sat pressed together in that cramped seat, being jolted along, I was overcome by a strange, passive impulse—a feeling I had never known and couldn't quite comprehend.

He turned out to be the owner of a soap factory in Sonezaki, and he took me to the second floor of his shop. There, as he took my hand, I experienced a "perversion" from him that was neither purely male nor female. It was the first time in my life I experienced true ecstasy as a patient of this "abnormal disease." From that night, my condition entered its third stage, growing more intense by the day until it progressed to the point of no return.

Now, whenever the evening shadows fall, my "illness" lures me out into the streets. I am a figure in women's clothing, wandering from one alley to the next. Night after night, I seek out these deviant stimulations; I have become a terrible creature who cannot sleep unless that craving is satisfied. Yet, once morning comes, I return to my life as a respectable salaryman, heading to work with a face that betrays nothing of my secret.

To this day, there is not a single soul who knows both the man of the day and the woman of the night.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography & Layout**: The text is set in a traditional vertical orientation (*tategaki*), reading from top to bottom and right to left. It uses a standard serif typeface typical of mid-century Japanese printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The text is dense with minimal paragraph breaks, creating a "confessional" wall-of-text feel. The use of "〜" (repetition marks) for words like *dandan* (gradually) and *wakuwaku* (pounding heart) is standard for the era.
*   **Column Structure**: The page is divided into multiple vertical columns (roughly 4-5 visible here), common in magazine layouts to maximize content density.
*   **Page Marker**: A small "14" is printed at the bottom right, indicating the page number.
*   **Kasu-tori Aesthetic**: The paper quality appears somewhat coarse or weathered (visible in the scan grain), and the subject matter—an illicit "true confession" (*taiken-dan*)—is the hallmark of the *Kasu-tori* magazines of the late 1940s and 1950s.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasu-tori Magazines**: The term *Kasu-tori* refers to a low-quality, bootleg shochu made from sake lees. Just as the alcohol was said to make you sick after three cups, these magazines were often short-lived, usually folding after three issues. They flourished in the immediate post-war period (1946–1955), focusing on "the three S’s": Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports/Sensation.
*   **Medicalization of Identity**: The author repeatedly uses the word *hentai* (abnormal/pervert) and refers to his behavior as a "disease" (*byō*) with "symptoms" (*shōjō*). In this era, LGBTQ+ identities and gender non-conformity were heavily pathologized, viewed through the lens of "abnormal psychology" rather than identity.
*   **Post-War Urban Landscape**: 
    *   **Yakeato (Burned Ruins)**: Refers to the areas of Japanese cities leveled by Allied bombing. These ruins became spaces for illicit activity and the "underground" life described by the author.
    *   **Rintaku (Bicycle Taxi)**: A common mode of transport in the late 1940s due to fuel shortages.
    *   **Yamiyah (Black Marketeers)**: Essential to survival in the post-war economy, often operating out of the very train stations the author haunts.
*   **Osaka Geography**: The locations mentioned—Tennoji Park, Ueroku (Uehommachi 6-chome), Nipponbashi, and Sonezaki—were (and are) major hubs in Osaka, with Sonezaki specifically known for its nightlife and history of "hidden" sexual subcultures.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Hentai (變態)**: Today, this often refers to pornographic anime (Hentai). In this text, it is used in its original psycho-medical sense: "abnormality" or "deviation from the norm."
*   **Onnagata (女形)**: Male actors who play female roles in Kabuki. This provided a culturally legible (though strictly performative) framework for the author's cross-dressing.
*   **Kagama (陰間)**: Historical term for young male prostitutes who dressed as women. The author looks to history to find a "lineage" for his feelings.
*   **Dōran (ドーラン)**: Greasepaint/theatrical makeup.
*   **Ranbyaku-ko (白粉)**: Traditional white lead-based powder makeup.
*   **Nankyoku-teki Keikō (暗異的傾向?)**: The transcription is tricky here; it looks like "dark-strange tendency." It's a self-coined or period-specific way to describe "deviant" urges.
*   **Rintaku (リンタク)**: Short for "Rin-hirei Takushi" (Bicycle Taxi).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Double Life**: A central theme is the sharp divide between the "serious salaryman" (day) and the "deviant wanderer" (night). This reflects the intense social pressure of the Shōwa era to conform to rigid gender and professional roles.
*   **Addiction & Compulsion**: The author frames his behavior as an addiction (comparing it to opium), suggesting a lack of agency. This might be a rhetorical strategy to elicit sympathy or to explain why he cannot "simply stop."
*   **The Thrill of Passing**: The text captures the psychological high of "passing" in public and the specific "thrill" (*suriru*) of being treated as a woman by strangers.
*   **Class and Gender**: The encounter with the "soap factory master" introduces a class element, where the author finds "true pleasure" in a submissive role, further complicating his gender performance with power dynamics.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type**: Confessional Essay (告白記), First-person Narrative.
*   **Thematic Tags**: Gender non-conformity, Cross-dressing (女装), Post-war Japan, Urban alienation, Psycho-sexual deviance, Kasu-tori culture.
*   **Classification**: Adult/Subculture (Historical).
