## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

グが變ると云うんです。何故生理日に靴下を取換えるかつ？　そ、そこまで云わせたならもうしまいです。百聞は一見に如かず、それでも疑惑のあるご人は、一ヶ月間女店員のおあしに注意なさるといい、自ら筆者の言を肯定されること請合。いや、デパートの事情に精通されているご人なら、即座に納得がゆかれると思う。
「弓子さん、一寸レジスター頼むわよ。婆大急ぎで便所（ハコ）へ行つて来るから」
「アラ、あんたさつき行つたばかりぢやないの、また？」
すると弓子孃は臆面もなく片脚を擧げてニヤリとした。なるほど、肉色のストッキングが黒色に變つている。赤いお客様が訪れた證據なのだ。
「まあ、ソメヤ（月經）だつたの、何日から？」
「今日から……美ゆううつになるワ、女なんて本当に面倒臭いもんね」
「ほゝほ、あんたばかりぢやないワ、私だつてもう四五日もしたら、おつきあいするわよ」
斯んな密語は二千人の女体を擁している丈に、物珍らしいことではない。水密桃のようなお尻を左右に振つて、バタ／＼とハコ（便所）の中へ跳込んで行く。一方男子の店員達は、彼女等のストッキングに異變を認めると俄かに鋭敏な神經を動かす。お客様の前では実に石部金吉然として、勤直な物腰である彼等も元々木の実から生れた子ではない、ニキビとラヴレターの過度期が過ぎ去ると、曲りなりにも一應の性知識を身に付けている。異性の生理にタッチしたのがも無理からぬ話だ、経期間に於ける性的欲望が非常に旺盛であることを、又受胎の懸念の無いことも、知つてゝ知らぬ顔の半兵衛だ。

（中略）

アタシはレジスターよ
お金がほしいの

「オイ／＼そりや本当かい？……実は僕ア彼女が……」
「分つてるよ。好きなんだろ？　どうだ短刀直入に切り出して見ないか、嫌だと言われれば引込むんぢやないぜ、玉手、玉手と、詰めて行きやあ、戀愛將棋も終盤だよ、はゝゝ」

（右下部分）
「ふゝゝゝ、どうなすつたの変な顔なさつて？　妾がお賑やかでもう帰さないワ」
盛り上つた二つの丘を愼ましく肉迫させて来た。
「あ！　ど、どうするンです。ぼ、僕を……」
翌朝佐川初段は悄然として將棋寶場に出勤した。睡眠不足の青い顔である。
「オイ佐川始段、昨夜の対局はどうだつた？　香車の一手で攻めたんだろうな、ハゝゝ」
「……ところが君、一寸歩兵の悪い将棋になつたンだ。後で金將を取られてね」
「何？　金を請求した？……フーム、それぢや彼女はパン助か、ここに名人が着いている。対局はさしずめ今晩のホテルだな、はゝゝ」

グが変わると言うんです。何故生理日に靴下を取り替えるのか？　そ、そこまで言わせたならもうおしまいです。百聞は一見に如かず、それでも疑惑のあるご仁は、一ヶ月間女店員の足元に注意なさるといい、自ら筆者の言葉を肯定されること請け合い。いや、デパートの事情に精通されているご仁なら、即座に納得がいかれると思う。

「弓子さん、ちょっとレジスター頼むわよ。私、大急ぎで便所（ハコ）へ行って来るから」
「あら、あんたさっき行ったばかりじゃないの、また？」
すると弓子嬢は臆面もなく片脚を挙げてニヤリとした。なるほど、肌色のストッキングが黒色に変わっている。赤いお客様（月経）が訪れた証拠なのだ。
「まあ、ソメヤ（月経）だったの、何日から？」
「今日から……ああ、憂鬱（ゆううつ）になるわ、女なんて本当に面倒臭いもんね」
「ほほほ、あなたばかりじゃないわ、私だってもう四五日もしたら、お付き合いするわよ」

そんな密談は二千人の女体を擁しているだけに、物珍しいことではない。水蜜桃のようなお尻を左右に振って、バタバタとハコ（便所）の中へ飛び込んで行く。一方男子の店員たちは、彼女たちのストッキングに異変を認めると俄かに鋭敏な神経を動かす。お客様の前では実に石部金吉然（いしがきんきちぜん）として、勤勉な物腰である彼らも、元々木の実から生まれた子ではない。ニキビとラブレターの過渡期が過ぎ去ると、曲がりなりにも一通りの性知識を身に付けている。異性の生理に反応したのも無理からぬ話だ。経期間における性的欲望が非常に旺盛であることを、また受胎の懸念がないことも、知っていて知らぬ顔の半兵衛だ。

「おいおい、そりゃ本当かい？……実は僕ぁ彼女が……」
「分かってるよ。好きなんだろ？　どうだ、単刀直入に切り出して見ないか。嫌だと言われれば身を引くんじゃないぜ。王手、王手と、詰めていけば、恋愛将棋も終盤だよ。ははは」

「ふふふ、どうなさったの？　変な顔なさって。私が賑やかで、もう帰さないわ」
盛り上がった二つの丘を慎ましく肉迫させてきた。
「あ！　ど、どうするんです？　ぼ、僕を……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The [stocking] color changes, it is said. Why on menstruation days do they change socks? If you make me say it that far, it is the end. Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times; even so, a person with doubts should pay attention to the female clerks' feet for one month, and they will surely affirm the author's words. No, if it is a person well-versed in department store affairs, I think they will understand immediately.

"Yumiko-san, please look after the register for a moment. I’m going to the box (toilet) in a great hurry."
"Oh, didn't you just go a moment ago, again?"
Then Miss Yumiko, without any shame, lifted one leg and smirked. Indeed, the flesh-colored stockings had changed to black. It was proof that the "red guest" had visited.
"Oh, was it *someya* (menstruation)? From what day?"
"From today... Oh, it becomes gloomy, women are truly troublesome things, aren't they?"
"Ho ho ho, it's not just you; in four or five days, I will be joining you."

Such secret talk, since the place holds two thousand female bodies, is not something rare. Shaking buttocks like honey peaches from left to right, they go clattering into the box (toilet). Meanwhile, the male clerks, upon noticing the change in their stockings, suddenly move their sensitive nerves. Before customers they are truly like Ishigaki Kinkichi (straight-laced), with diligent manners, but they are not children born from nuts (they are human). Once the transition period of pimples and love letters has passed, they have acquired a certain amount of sexual knowledge in their own way. It is no wonder they react to the opposite sex's physiology. That sexual desire during the period is very vigorous, and also that there is no concern of conception—they know this but play the "Half-Beard" (pretend not to know).

(In Illustration)
I am a cash register.
I want money.

"Hey hey, is that true? ... Actually, I, regarding her..."
"I know. You like her, right? How about cutting straight to the point? If she says no, don't back off. Check, check, and close in; then the love-shogi is in its final stage. Ha ha ha."

"Heh heh, what happened? Making such a strange face. I am 'lively' and won't let you go home yet."
She brought the two swollen hills modestly into close contact.
"Ah! Wh-what are you doing? T-to me..."
The next morning, Sagawa 1st-dan arrived at the shogi parlor looking dejected. He had a pale face from lack of sleep.
"Hey Sagawa, how was last night's match? You attacked with the Lance (Kyosha) move, didn't you? Ha ha ha."
"Well, you see... it became a match with bad Pawn (Fu) play. Later, my Gold General (Kinsho) was taken."
"What? She demanded money? Hmm, then is she a *pan-suke* (prostitute)? A master is right here. The match will surely be at a hotel tonight, ha ha ha."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

They say the color changes. Why do the girls switch their stockings when they’re on their period? If I have to spell it out for you, the conversation is already over. Seeing is believing; if you still doubt me, just watch the shopgirls' feet for a month. You’ll see I’m right soon enough. In fact, anyone who knows the ins and outs of department store life will know exactly what I’m talking about.

"Yumiko, watch the register for a second, will you? I’ve gotta run to the ‘box’ (restroom)!"
"Again? Didn't you just go a few minutes ago?"
Without a hint of modesty, Yumiko smirked and hiked up one leg. Sure enough, her usual flesh-toned stockings had been replaced with black ones—unmistakable proof that her "monthly visitor" had arrived.
"Oh, so it’s your time? Since when?"
"Starting today... God, it’s so depressing. Being a woman is nothing but a hassle."
"Ho ho! You aren't the only one. Give it four or five days and I’ll be right there with you."

In a place teeming with two thousand women, such whispered secrets are common. They swing their peach-like hips as they hurry off to the restroom. Meanwhile, the male clerks are quick to notice the change in hosiery, their senses sharpening instantly. Though they act like the ultimate straight-laced professionals in front of the customers, they weren't born yesterday. Having survived the awkward years of acne and love letters, they’ve picked up a fair bit of "carnal knowledge." They know all about the heightened desires during that time of the month—and the lack of pregnancy risk. They know exactly what’s going on, but they play dumb.

(Illustration Caption)
**I’m a cash register.
I just want the money.**

"Hey, is that for real? To tell the truth, I’ve got a thing for her..."
"We know, we know. You’re crazy about her. Why don't you just be blunt and make your move? And don't back down if she says no. Just keep putting her in check; the game of 'Love Shogi' is won in the endgame. Hahaha!"

"Heh heh, what’s wrong? Why the long face? I’m feeling 'lively' tonight, and I’m not letting you go home."
She pressed her "twin hills" against him with modest aggression.
"Ah! W-what are you doing? Wh-what are you doing to me...?"
The next morning, Sagawa showed up at the shogi parlor looking absolutely wrecked. His face was pale from a total lack of sleep.
"Hey, Sagawa! How was the 'match' last night? I bet you went in hard with your Lance, eh? Hahaha!"
"Actually... the play was a bit sloppy. My 'Gold General' ended up getting taken."
"What? She asked for cash? Hmm, so she’s a *pan-suke*, is she? Well, you’ve got a real pro on your hands now. I guess tonight’s rematch will be at a hotel! Hahaha!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses traditional vertical Japanese text (tategaki), read from top-to-bottom, right-to-left. It is divided into several columns.
*   **Typography:** Uses a mixture of standard Mincho-style font for the body and a more stylized, hand-written-looking font for the illustration's provocative caption ("I am a cash register").
*   **Illustration:** Centrally placed, featuring a woman in a state of partial undress (showing shoulders and back), looking over her shoulder with a playful/seductive expression. This is typical of "Kasutori" magazines, which walked the line between mainstream entertainment and eroticism.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration dominates the center, drawing the eye, while the surrounding text provides "scientific" or "observational" anecdotes that justify the voyeuristic content.
*   **Special Formatting:** Use of "furigana" (small kana next to kanji) is present but sparse, usually for slang or specific readings. Parenthetical notes (like "hako" for toilet) are used to explain contemporary slang.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** The text is a prime example of post-war "Kasutori" magazines. Named after a cheap, low-quality dregs-distilled shochu, these magazines were printed on poor quality paper and usually folded after three issues (like the drink's reputation for causing a "three-cup hangover"). They focused on the "Three S's": Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports.
*   **Black Stockings & Menstruation:** The text discusses a supposed "custom" or "urban legend" in department stores where female employees wore black stockings during their menstrual cycles to signal to each other (or perhaps to hide leaks, though the text frames it as a signal). This highlights the period's obsession with female physiology as a "mysterious" and eroticized topic.
*   **Shogi Metaphors:** The latter half of the text uses Shogi (Japanese chess) terminology as a heavy-handed double entendre for sexual conquest.
    *   *Kyosha* (Lance): A piece that moves only forward, symbolizing a direct sexual advance.
    *   *Kinsho* (Gold General): Often used here to refer to "Kin" (money), implying the woman was a prostitute or demanded payment.
*   **Pan-suke:** A slang term for street prostitutes who catered to the Allied occupation forces and later to Japanese men in the post-war era.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ハコ (Hako):** Literally "Box." Slang for a toilet or a small room/booth.
*   **ソメヤ (Someya):** An archaic or professional slang term for menstruation (likely related to "dyeing" or "staining").
*   **石部金吉 (Ishibe Kinkichi):** A proverbial name for a person who is overly serious, stubborn, and straight-laced.
*   **知らぬ顔の半兵衛 (Shiranu-gao no Hanbei):** An idiom meaning to pretend not to know something that you actually know very well (playing dumb).
*   **パン助 (Pan-suke):** A derogatory term for a prostitute.
*   **水密桃 (Suimitsuto):** Literally "Honey Peach," a common erotic metaphor for firm, round buttocks or breasts.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and Surveillance:** The narrator encourages readers to spy on the "shopgirls" and observe their bodies for signs of their biological cycles. This reflects a male-centric gaze that viewed the new "working women" of the city as objects of study and desire.
*   **The "Modern Girl" as Commodity:** The illustration caption "I am a cash register; I want money" suggests a cynical view of women's liberation and labor. It implies that the working woman is either a machine for making money or a mercenary who exchanges her femininity for cash.
*   **The Intersection of Purity and Profanity:** The text oscillates between describing the "peachy" beauty of the women and the "troublesome/gloomy" reality of menstruation, ending with a crude joke about prostitution. This duality is a hallmark of the *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque) literary style.
*   **Post-War Economic Desperation:** The subtext of the Shogi match (where "Gold" is taken) points to the harsh economic reality where sexual favors were often tied to financial need.
