## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Short Story Section]**

...into, silently taking off shoes.
It was a four-and-a-half mat room, disagreeably empty and without decoration. Two or three bromides (celebrity photos) pasted on the wall were somehow lonely.
Then the sliding door opened, and the woman, entering the room, looked down at Yoshitaro and smiled idiotically.
It was a faded long undergarment. As if to hide the body odor of men soaked into it, a strong smell of perfume struck Yoshitaro’s nose. It was an indescribably unpleasant smell of perfume mixed with men’s body odor.
Yoshitaro, every night since that night, seeking Toyoko’s flesh, seeking a phantom, wandered aimlessly through the night streets.
And so, he fell straight down the path of depravity.

    Five

In the streets, a cold wind that seemed to tear the body was blowing "byuu byuu."
Yoshitaro, startled, stood stock-still.
Those eyes were sharply chasing something.
Being jostled by the wave of people, a woman walking as if slipping through—it was, without mistake, Toyoko, whom he could not forget even in dreams.
Yoshitaro’s eyes shone, and his face flushed with joy.
Yoshitaro, pattering, ran out and followed after the woman.
"Toyoko-neesan!"
That voice was bouncing with happiness.

Yoshitaro, in the two months since then, had now entered a gang of delinquents. His clothing had also become a fashionable dandy style of the day, unrecognizable.
"Oh."
Toyoko turned around with a start. She opened her eyes wide at the extreme change in Yoshitaro.
However, the next moment Toyoko became aloof,
"Who are you?"
And she made an "I don't know you" face.
"I, it’s me. It’s Yoshitaro. Toyoko-neesan, did you forget me?"
"Yoshitaro? I don't know such a person. Isn't it some kind of mistake?"
"That’s a lie, Neesan, look, it’s me."
Yoshitaro began to get irritated at Toyoko’s excessively cold attitude.
"What I don't know, I don't know. How rude, I'm in a hurry."
Toyoko started walking.
At that time, Yoshitaro let out a voice of surprise. Because until now he was only paying attention to Toyoko, he hadn't noticed, but Toyoko was leading a boy of about seventeen or eighteen, the same as Yoshitaro.
Toyoko, just like at the time of Yoshitaro, was trying to toy with that boy.
"Come, let's go."
Toyoko took that boy’s hand and started walking.
As he stood there dazed, the cold north wind, irrelevant to the happenings of the human world, blew "byuu byuu" increasingly.
(End)

**[Fiction: The Descent of Yoshitaro]**

He stepped inside and silently removed his shoes. The room was a barren four-and-a-half mat space, stark and devoid of decoration. A few celebrity "bromide" photos tacked to the wall felt inexplicably bleak. When the sliding door creaked open, the woman entered and looked down at Yoshitaro with a vacant, idiotic grin. She wore a faded *nagajuban* undergarment. A sharp, pungent perfume struck his nose, as if meant to mask the lingering stench of other men’s sweat—an indescribably foul cocktail of scents. From that night on, Yoshitaro wandered the night-shrouded streets, fruitlessly chasing the phantom of Toyoko’s flesh. He was falling, headlong and irrevocable, down the path of ruin.

V

The streets were lashed by a biting north wind that felt sharp enough to tear the skin. Suddenly, Yoshitaro froze. His eyes narrowed, desperately tracking a figure through the crowd. Moving effortlessly through the sea of people was a woman—there was no mistake; it was Toyoko, the woman he had been unable to forget even in his dreams. His eyes lit up, and his face flushed with a surge of joy. He broke into a run, scrambling after her.
"Toyoko-san!" he cried, his voice trembling with relief.

In the two months since they had last met, Yoshitaro had fallen in with a rough crowd. His appearance had changed entirely; he was now dressed as a flashy, modern delinquent.
"Oh?" Toyoko turned, her eyes widening at his transformation. But in a heartbeat, her expression turned cold and haughty.
"And who might you be?" she asked, feigning total ignorance.
"It... it’s me! Yoshitaro! Toyoko-san, surely you haven't forgotten me?"
"Yoshitaro? I don’t know anyone by that name. You must have me confused with someone else."
"Don't lie, Sister! Look at me, it’s really me!" Yoshitaro grew frantic at her icy indifference.
"I told you, I don't know you. How incredibly rude. I'm in a hurry."
She turned to walk away. It was only then that Yoshitaro gasped in shock. He had been so fixated on Toyoko that he hadn't noticed the youth by her side—a boy of seventeen or eighteen, just like he had been. Toyoko was leading him away, clearly intent on toyed with him just as she had with Yoshitaro.
"Come on, let’s go," she said, taking the boy’s hand.
As Yoshitaro stood there, stunned and broken, the cold north wind continued to howl around him, utterly indifferent to the tragedies of men.

**[Erotic Discourse: Satirical Column]**

**Erotic Discourse**

◇ Some fool wrote to a newspaper demanding that women cover their bare legs with *tabi* socks because they "incite lust in the opposite sex." Such a person is merely advertising the vulgarity of their own character to the world. Is it so impossible to simply appreciate the beauty of a young woman's bare legs for what it is?

◇ Try crossing an intersection carelessly, and you will certainly be fined for ignoring the signal without mercy. Yet, when a policeman arrests an innocent man or a tax official levies an extortionate tax based on a "miscalculation," they are never punished. It’s a strange world where the officials are exalted and the citizens are despised.

◇ The air is thick with noisy election slogans: "Overall Peace," "Separate Peace," "National Independence," "Absolute Opposition to War." How about we add "Total Suppression of Erotic Magazines" to the list? Like that certain moral committee. It’s the perfect slogan; nobody can openly oppose it without looking like a deviant.

◇ I remember during the war, under the slogan "Strike Until We Win," groups of matrons would hand out reprimands to young girls wearing long-sleeved kimonos or flashy clothes. When I asked one of those "madams" what they are up to these days, she replied, "Oh, we are currently devoted to the suppression of erotic magazines!" Opportunism is a powerful thing, indeed.

◇ A "pan-pan" (streetwalker) once barked, "What's wrong with selling my own body?" when confronted. Honestly, there are plenty of high-ranking "gentlemen" who embezzle the people's taxes and then walk away with fat retirement bonuses as if nothing happened. Before you crack down on the girls, why don't you catch those fellows?

◇ "Hey you, you can't be doing that here!" / "Y-yes, officer, we were just taking a stroll..." 
As the weather gets warmer, patrolling secluded spots becomes a chore. Especially with these "couple murders" occurring lately.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The page is divided into two distinct horizontal zones. The top features narrative fiction, while the bottom (separated by a decorative border) contains a satirical column. This is typical of *Kasutori* magazines which blended entertainment with social critique.
*   **Typography:** Vertical text orientation (*tategaki*). The fiction uses a standard font size, while the "Ero Dangii" section uses slightly different spacing and diamond (◇) bullet points to separate anecdotes. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "エロ 談義" is written in a stylized, bold, hand-drawn font to draw the eye. There is a small cartoon illustration of a man looking annoyed, holding a bottle of "Whisky" (written as ウヰスキー in old kana), which adds to the cynical, "man-on-the-street" tone of the section.
*   **Ending Marker:** The story ends with (完) "End" and (完) in the transcription indicates the conclusion of a serialized piece.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** Late 1940s (Occupation-era Japan). This is evidenced by the "Kasutori" style, references to "pan-pan" girls (prostitutes serving GIs and locals), and the political debate between "Overall Peace" and "Separate Peace" (referring to the San Francisco Peace Treaty negotiations).
*   **"Kasutori" Magazines:** These were cheap, pulp magazines printed on bad paper. They flourished between 1946 and 1950. The name comes from *kasutori shochu* (dregs liquor)—just as you get a headache after three cups of the liquor, these magazines were said to fold after three issues.
*   **Pan-pan (パンパン):** A term for streetwalkers in post-war Japan. The "Ero Dangii" section highlights the social tension between these women (often forced into work by poverty) and the "moral" upper class or corrupt officials.
*   **Bromide (ブロマイド):** Commercial portraits of actors or singers. In the 1940s, having a few of these in a drab room was a small attempt at glamour in a poverty-stricken life.
*   **Moral Policing:** The text satirizes the "Madams" who previously policed "unpatriotic" fashion during the war and have now pivoted to policing "erotic magazines," showing a cynical view of moral crusaders.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **墮落 (Daraku):** "Fall" or "Depravity." A major keyword in post-war "Burai-ha" (Decadent School) literature (e.g., Ango Sakaguchi's "Discourse on Decadence").
*   **伊達男 (Date-otoko):** A dandy, a showy or fashionable man.
*   **白痴的 (Hakuchiteki):** "Idiotic" or "vacant." Used here to describe the woman’s glazed-over, professional smile.
*   **官尊民卑 (Kanson Minpi):** "Respect for officials, contempt for the people." A phrase used to criticize the arrogance of the Japanese bureaucracy.
*   **アベック (Abekku):** From the French *avec* (with). Used in post-war Japan to mean a "couple." "Abekku-satsujin" refers to the murder of couples in secluded areas, a common sensationalist news item of the era.
*   **ウヰスキー (Whisky):** Uses the archaic kana ヰ (wi), common in pre-modern and early post-war branding.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Nihilism:** The story of Yoshitaro is one of inescapable ruin. He loses his innocence to Toyoko, tries to find her, and finds she has already replaced him with a new victim. This reflects the "lost generation" feel of the 1940s.
*   **Social Hypocrisy:** The "Ero Dangii" section is heavily focused on the hypocrisy of the state and the "moral" elite. It points out that while the poor are punished for minor infractions or "vice," the rich and powerful embezzle taxes with impunity.
*   **Gender and Power:** The woman, Toyoko, is depicted as a predatory figure who "toys" with young boys, yet she is also a victim of the era, living in a drab room smelling of "other men’s body odor."
*   **The "Cold Wind" Motif:** The recurring mention of the "cold north wind" acting "irrelevant to human affairs" emphasizes a naturalistic, uncaring universe where the characters' suffering means nothing.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story), Satire/Editorial (Column).
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Prostitution, Delinquency, Corruption, Social Hypocrisy, Nihilism, Poverty.
*   **Classification:** Mature (themes of depravity and prostitution), Historical, Literary.
