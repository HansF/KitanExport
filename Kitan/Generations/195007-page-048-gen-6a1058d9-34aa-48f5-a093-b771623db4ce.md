（解説・実用記事部分）
立っているときには、赤ん坊を抱くように両手で鞄を胸の前に引きつけて、しっかりと抱く。この場合、尾錠（びじょう）のある方は胸の方に向ける。座席に座る場合は、腹の前にぴったりつけて、上から両手でしっかり抱えておくことである。こうすれば、どんなスリでもカミソリの刃の立てようがない。無理にやろうとすれば相手の腕を切るからである。財布（ドル入れ）を尻ポケットや、外套（がいとう）の外ポケットに入れることは絶対禁物である。必ず上着の内ポケットに入れ、上着のボタンをかけておく方がよい。それから、誰も利用しないが、チョッキの裏側のポケットに財布を入れたら、どんな巧妙なスリでも手を出せない。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

I was in a hurry.
Regarding the stolen money, I had it managed [raised] by my old man in the countryside, and it was settled.
Passing Ginza 1-chome, turning right at the Ouchi Radio shop in Ginza 2-chome to head toward the station, suddenly, about three *ken* [approx. 5.4 meters] ahead, a woman in Western clothes peeking into the window of a clothing store—certainly, it is the back view of the woman from the day before yesterday.
Haruo, in a frenzy, tapped her shoulder. He, due to excitement, voice does not come out. She, with a start, looked at his face. Her facial color in an instant, turned to the color of blue consternation, which he did not miss.
"Y-you, right?"
Haruo, what to say was good [what he should say], subsequent words did not follow, only her face staring at [he] continued.
"My, isn't it Mr. Segawa? What a coincidence. Why such a scary face, are you being angry? Yesterday, I waited from over there too. The one to be angry is my (concubine/me) side! I waited for two hours in front of the Onoda Watch Store as promised."
"What are you saying? Even if it's in front of the Onoda Watch Store, you said it like that..."
"At that time, I was drunk so it might be a misunderstanding, but one more thing, tell me why you know me. I, that night, had company money stolen."
"Then, I am the closest suspect, right? If I speak about how I knew you, you..."
In the face with a smile on those familiar coaxing large eyes, something like an indivisible [unresolved] emotion seemed to be hidden. As if I'd let myself be deceived by such a woman.
"You, wasn't the promise to meet at the coffee shop in front of the station?"

(How-to section)
When standing, like holding a baby, with both hands pull the bag to the front of the chest and hold firmly. In this case, the side with the buckle should be faced toward the chest. In the case of sitting in a seat, attach it tightly to the front of the belly, and from above hold it firmly with both hands. If doing this, even any pickpocket has no way to set a razor blade. Because if they try to do it forcibly, they will cut the opponent's arm. Putting a dollar-holder [wallet] in a back pocket or an overcoat's outer pocket is absolutely forbidden. Definitely put it in an inner pocket of a jacket, and it is better to keep the jacket buttoned. Then, although no one uses it, if you put the dollar-holder in a pocket on the reverse side of a vest, even any clever pickpocket cannot put out a hand.
The author sometimes goes up to the capital for company business, but carelessly placing a bag on the luggage rack, twice brilliantly had it "slid" [picked], a bitter experience he has. Usually, because he takes the 10:30 PM night train departing from Osaka, the sleepiest 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM time is exactly around Shizuoka. The times he was picked were both around that Shizuoka. For those who travel, especially before dawn, the time one becomes drowsy is the best earning time for a "box-master" [train pickpocket], you should be warned.

**The Female Pickpocket Who Pierced Through Love**
Pickpockets are in a pair of minimum two people, even if by chance one side tries to wash their feet [quit] and become an honest person, the partner clings in shadow and light [secretly and openly], and one cannot escape from the quagmire of pickpocketing.
The one called the "Big Sister" of the Number Family, "Sachi of Namba," also known as Sachiko Shimotsu (22) =pseudonym=, became a pair with a man named Yamamoto, using two razor blades as weapons, was raiding the Osaka Subway. Sachiko, after graduating from a certain girls' school, was working at a large company in Kitahama, but exactly four years ago, between Honmachi and Yodoyabashi on the subway, the salary she had just received that day was taken by a pickpocket. Burning with revenge for that, one day inside the subway, mingling in the crowd, she quickly "slid" the dollar-holder of the neighboring girl student. And when she went out to the subway exit:
"Hey, don't know what kind of sister you are, but here is the Number Family's territory! Hmph, with the status of a novice [amateur], are you trying to do a daring territory raid?"
So, a young man with a bad-looking face and colored glasses drew close and threatened. This was Kobayashi of the Number Family. Sachiko, having her weakness grasped by Kobayashi, was dragged bit by bit into the circle of the Number Family.
Yamamoto, who became a partner with Sachiko, was a junior to Kobayashi and was a famous skilled hand even in the Number Family. Yamamoto, as the colored-glasses partner, trained Sachiko thoroughly. That she became an undisputed "Big Sister" called "Sachi of Namba" from a complete amateur was thanks to Yamamoto, and that for nine years she was not caught by a detective even once was because Yamamoto skillfully helped her by throwing away his own life at dangerous precipices.
But, even if called a female pickpocket, she is still a young woman. Sachiko, before she knew it, at the subway which is the earning ground, met by chance a station attendant Mr. Kiyoshi Matsushita (27) =pseudonym= who became an unforgettable person. Always quiet...

**The Encounter in Ginza**
I was in a desperate hurry. I had managed to scrape together the stolen money from my old man back in the country, finally putting that mess behind me. I was passing through Ginza 1-chome and had just turned right at the Ouchi Radio shop in 2-chome, heading for the station. Suddenly, my eyes caught a woman in Western dress peeking into a shop window about twenty feet ahead. There was no mistaking it—that was the silhouette of the woman from two nights ago.

Driven by a sudden impulse, Haruo reached out and tapped her shoulder. His throat was so tight with excitement he couldn't find his voice. She spun around, startled. He didn't miss the way her face instantly drained of color, replaced by a look of sheer terror.

"It’s... it’s you, isn't it?" Haruo stammered, unable to find the words, his gaze fixed on her in a hard stare.

"Oh, if it isn't Mr. Segawa! What a coincidence," she chirped, recovering her composure. "Why the frightening face? Why are you so angry? I was the one waiting for you yesterday. I’m the one who should be upset! I waited two hours in front of the Onoda Watch Store, just like we agreed."

"What are you talking about? You were the one who insisted on the Onoda Watch Store..."

"I was drunk that night; maybe I misheard. But more importantly, tell me how you know me. That night, the company's money was stolen from me."

"Oh, so I’m the prime suspect now? If I told you how I know you, then you'd..." 

A smile played across her face, those large, flirtatious eyes hiding something dark and calculated. *I won't let a woman like this play me for a fool,* Haruo thought.

"Listen, wasn't our agreement to meet at the café in front of the station?"

**How to Guard Against Pickpockets**
When standing, hold your bag to your chest with both hands as if cradling an infant. Ensure any buckles or openings are facing your body. If seated, keep it pressed against your stomach, clutching it firmly from above. This prevents any thief from finding an angle to use a razor blade; any attempt to do so would inevitably cut the owner's arm. Never keep your wallet in a back pocket or an outer coat pocket. It must be kept in the inner jacket pocket, with the jacket buttoned. Better yet, though few people do it, a wallet kept in an inside vest pocket is virtually untouchable, even for the most skilled thief.

The author frequently travels to the capital on business and has had his bag pilfered from the luggage rack twice. He usually takes the 10:30 PM night train from Osaka. The most dangerous time is between 3:00 and 4:00 AM—the peak of drowsiness—which usually occurs as the train passes through Shizuoka. Travelers should be warned: just before dawn, when you are drifting off, is the "harvest time" for the *Hakoshi* (train pickpockets).

**Namba Sachi: The Pickpocket Who Followed Her Heart**
In the world of pickpocketing, thieves work in pairs. Even if one tries to go straight, their partner haunts them, dragging them back into the mire. Sachiko Shimotsu (22, a pseudonym), known as "Namba Sachi," the "Big Sister" of the notorious Number Gang, was a master of the double-edged razor blade who terrorized the Osaka subways. 

Sachiko was a girl’s school graduate who had been working for a major firm in Kitahama. Four years ago, her entire salary was stolen on the subway between Honmachi and Yodoyabashi. Fueled by a desire for revenge, she turned to the craft herself, eventually lifting a wallet from a student in a crowded car. Upon exiting, she was confronted by a menacing young man in tinted glasses. "Hey, sister, I don't know who you are, but this is Number Gang territory. You think a rank amateur like you can just waltz in here?" This was Kobayashi, who blackmailed her into the gang.

Her partner, Yamamoto, was Kobayashi’s protege and a legend in the underworld. He molded the amateur Sachiko into the formidable "Namba Sachi." For nine years, she evaded the police, largely because Yamamoto was willing to risk his life to shield her. Yet, despite her reputation, she remained a young woman at heart. She eventually fell for a quiet station attendant named Kiyoshi Matsushita (27, a pseudonym) whom she met at the very station where she worked her "trade."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page uses a standard vertical layout characteristic of mid-20th-century Japanese magazines. It features a main narrative block at the top and a three-column layout at the bottom.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the feature story "戀をつらぬいた女スリ" (The Female Pickpocket Who Stayed True to Love) is bolded to draw the eye. 
*   **Illustration:** A hand-drawn sketch (likely pen and ink) depicts the protagonist Haruo (wearing glasses) confronting the woman in the street. The style is reminiscent of "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines of the post-war era—slightly noir and dramatic.
*   **Text Blocks:** The upper text is a narrative/fiction piece. The middle section serves as a "service" or "advice" column (how to avoid pickpockets), while the bottom section is a "true crime" or sensationalized biography of a female criminal.
*   **Characters:** The text uses some *Kyūjitai* (traditional characters like 戀 for 恋, 兩 for 両, 聲 for 声) and *Rekishiteki Kana-zukai* (historical kana usage like だらう for だろう), which places the publication definitely before the full standardization of modern Japanese in the late 1950s.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Crime:** In the 1940s and 50s, urban Japan (especially Tokyo and Osaka) saw a massive surge in pickpocketing due to poverty, overcrowded public transit, and a shattered social order.
*   **The "Hakoshi" (箱師):** This was specific slang for pickpockets who operated on trains ("hako" or box).
*   **Western Dress (洋装):** Mentioning the woman is in "Western dress" (Yōsō) was a significant descriptor in the early post-war years, distinguishing her from those still wearing kimonos or work pants (*monpe*). It often implied a sense of modernity, vanity, or perhaps "Pan-pan" (streetwalker) associations in pulp fiction.
*   **Namba & Kitahama:** These are major districts in Osaka. The story specifically mentions the Osaka Subway, which was a hub for commuters and, consequently, pickpockets.
*   **Razor Blades:** Pickpockets of this era famously used sharpened razor blades to slit open pockets or bags without the victim noticing.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ケリがついた (Keri ga tsuita):** An idiom meaning "to be settled" or "to come to an end." Derived from the "keri" ending in classical Japanese poetry.
*   **三間 (Sangen):** An old unit of length. One *ken* is about 1.8 meters, so three *ken* is roughly 5.4 meters.
*   **ドル入れ (Doru-ire):** Literally "dollar holder," but used here as a general term for a wallet or billfold. In the post-war period, American influence made "dollar" a common slang/synonym for money.
*   **姐御 (Anego):** "Big Sister" or "Matriarch." A term used for a high-ranking woman in a criminal organization or a gang leader's wife.
*   **トウシロウ (Tōshirō):** Slang for "amateur" or "novice" (reversing the syllables of *shirōto*).
*   **足を洗う (Ashi o arau):** "To wash one's feet"—an idiom meaning to quit a life of crime and go straight.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Fallen Woman" Trope:** Sachiko’s backstory (a respectable office girl who turns to crime after being a victim herself) is a classic melodrama trope. It suggests that crime is a "quagmire" (泥沼) that swallows the innocent.
*   **Paranoia and Deception:** The fiction piece at the top focuses on the inability to trust appearances. The woman’s "coaxing eyes" suggest she is a *femme fatale* figure common in noir.
*   **Practicality vs. Sensationalism:** The magazine balances "useful" advice (how not to get robbed) with "titillating" stories of female gangsters, a hallmark of the *Kasutori* magazine genre which aimed to entertain and provide a bit of "real-world" survival knowledge.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
