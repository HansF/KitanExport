ランデブー・きたん

千圓札は笑う　　　襟谷　帯一

つた目で、男と女を傍において、
「あんた達、昨夜のあれは何事でしたの、かつこの悪い。うちの身内の人がている時に、あんな事してもらつたら、私の顔にかかわります。」
「うちが何をしたと言いますの、ターさんがどこを〜してくすぐつたいから騒いだだけですのに、雑魚寝している中で、誰がいやらしいことしますかいな。」
一そんな事をしたせんという事と違います。あんまりはしたない事は、こんな稼業をしているから尚更、してもらいたくないのです。それにターさんじゃありませんか、年甲斐もなくふざけたりして、」
「何もしなかつたわけじゃなし、そんなに怒らなくてもいいじゃないか、」
ターさんはニヤ〜笑っているばかりである。
「ターさんも悪いけどあんたも悪い。ともかく皆の手前、安さんはやめてもらいます」
と言葉は丁寧だが、切口上に出られて、フン喰うに困るわけでもなし、誰がこんなところにてやるもんかと、さつさと家に帰つて来てしまつた。
家に戻つてからも、ダンスホールに入りびたりで、酒を呑み歩いていた。夜になると熱ぽくなり、倦怠を感じる様になったので、医師にみてもらうと、肋膜がすゝんでいると言われた。体に関しては割に臆病な彼女は忠実にダンスもやめ、酒もやめ医師に通つた。無性に世の中が淋しくなつて来た。気分のよい日、よく来た事のある中之島へ来てみた。
好天日和の十月の日曜で、皆郊外へ押し出したしらしく、公園はとり忘れられた　けさで、貸ボートはなつなれた　　川に漕ぎ出ているのは一つも見えなかつた、橋の上から大阪城が悠然と見える。
見馴れた大阪の風景が今更の様に美しく、いつまでも立ち止まって眺めていた。川岸にあるテニスコートもひつそりとしていて、若く美しい彼女に憂をかける男の影もない。
退屈まぎれに歩いて帰ろうと思って北濱の街角までくると、バッタリと上六のバーに居た女給の禮子に逢つた。女の子を抱いていた。安子がやめるより先に、店へくる常連の中で真面目な男と仲よく結婚して一年以上になる位やわ。
「安ちゃんどうしてるの、」
「うちはこの通りブラ〜してるのやあんた小山さんとどこないしてるの」
「うちこんな気儘者やろ、あの人可愛想な位やわ、」
「可愛い子やないの、」
「お父さんにそっくりやろ、妹の俊子ももうちより一月あとに結婚してね、いまアベノで喫茶店してるの、わ、女の子二人使つてわりと流行つてるから、あつちへ行つたら寄つてやつて頂戴」
「皆おちついて、いい塩梅になつてるんやな、」
「それから兼ちゃんね、あの人えらいわ田代さんと一緒に田舎へ帰つて百姓してるのよ、」
「へえ、あの兼ちゃんがね」
安さんと同じ呑んだくれの兼ちゃんが——あの派手好きの兼ちゃんが、真面目に百姓してるとは驚いた話である。
男てそんなにいとしいものをなめとる）とは思つたが、生来やさしい生田君であるから、クニコの呼び出し電話に、
「あゝ、……行くよ。いつものとこだね、あゝあゝウン、わかつた……さよなら」
月に七千と五百円也では、二十五日の月給日までお小遣いが残存する道理がない。今日は二十十日である。あゝ、かなしいかな、懐中いくど数えても三十八円。
（この懐中で、どうして彼女クニコさんとランデブウが出来るかというんだ？！）
折角、向うから呼び出しをかけられて数時間後には、彼女に会えるというのに、彼は（人の気も知らず、月の二十日というのに、呼び出しをかけるなんぞは、あんまり人をナメとる）
生田君は今かつててきた電話で、すっかりイマ〜しくなつた。

…つた目で、男と女を傍において、
「あんた達、昨夜のあれは何事でしたの、格好の悪い。うちの身内の人が見ている時に、あんな事してもらったら、私の顔に関わります。」
「うちが何をしたと言いますの、ターさんがどこかを〜してくすぐったいから騒いだだけですのに、雑魚寝している中で、誰がいやらしいことしますかいな。」

と言葉は丁寧だが、切り口上で出られて、不運、食うに困るわけでもなし、誰がこんなところにいてやるもんかと、さっさと家に帰って来てしまった。
家に戻ってからも、ダンスホールに入り浸りで、酒を飲み歩いていた。夜になると熱っぽくなり、倦怠を感じるようになったので、医師に診てもらうと、肋膜（ろくまく）が進んでいると言われた。体に関しては割に臆病な彼女は忠実にダンスも辞め、酒も辞め医師に通った。無性に世の中が寂しくなって来た。気分のよい日、よく来たことのある中之島へ来てみた。
好天日和の十月の日曜で、皆郊外へ押し出したらしく、公園は取り残された様子で、貸ボートは連れなれた川に漕ぎ出ているのは一つも見えなかった。橋の上から大阪城が悠然と見える。
見慣れた大阪の風景が今更のように美しく、いつまでも立ち止まって眺めていた。川岸にあるテニスコートもひっそりとしていて、若く美しい彼女に憂いをかける男の影もない。
退屈紛れに歩いて帰ろうと思って北浜の街角まで来ると、ばったりと上六のバーにいた女給の礼子に会った。女の子を抱いていた。安子が辞めるより先に、店へ来る常連の中で真面目な男と仲良く結婚して一年以上になる位だわ。

「それから兼ちゃんね、あの人偉いわ。田代さんと一緒に田舎へ帰って百姓してるのよ。」
「へえ、あの兼ちゃんがね。」
安さんと同じ飲んだくれの兼ちゃんが——あの派手好きの兼ちゃんが、真面目に百姓してるとは驚いた話である。
（男ってそんなに愛しいものをなめとる）とは思たが、生来優しい生田君であるから、クニコの呼び出し電話に、
「ああ、……行くよ。いつものとこだね、ああああ、うん、わかった……さよなら。」

折角、向こうから呼び出しをかけられて数時間後には、彼女に会えるというのに、彼は（人の気も知らず、月の二十日というのに、呼び出しをかけるなんぞは、あんまり人をなめとる）
生田君は今掛けてきた電話で、すっかり忌々しくなった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Rendezvous Strange Tale**
**The Thousand-Yen Bill Laughs** — Eriya Obiichi

...with [sharp] eyes, placing the man and woman aside,
"You all, what was that last night? It looked bad. When people related to my house are watching, if you do such things, it affects my face (reputation)."
"What are you saying I did? T-san did something ~ and it was ticklish so I just made a noise. In the middle of sleeping all together, who would do something lewd?"
"I am not saying you did such a thing. Unbecoming things, because we are in this trade, all the more, I don't want you to do. And isn't it T-san? Acting silly despite his age."
"It's not like I did nothing, you don't have to be so angry, do you?"
T-san was only grinning.
"T-san is bad but you are also bad. At any rate, in front of everyone, I'll have Yasu-san quit."
The words were polite, but spoken in a formal, dismissive tone; not that she was in trouble for food, who would stay in a place like this? And so she quickly went back home.
After returning home, she spent her time in dance halls, walking around drinking. When night came she became feverish and felt fatigue, so seeing a doctor, she was told her pleurisy was advancing. Regarding her body, she was relatively timid, so she faithfully quit dancing, quit drinking, and went to the doctor. The world became intensely lonely. On a day of good spirits, she went to Nakanoshima where she often used to go.
It was a sunny October Sunday, and everyone seemed to have pushed out to the suburbs; the park felt left behind, and not a single rental boat could be seen rowing out on the familiar river. From atop the bridge, Osaka Castle can be seen serenely.
The familiar Osaka scenery looked beautiful as if for the first time, and she stood still watching for a long time. The tennis courts on the riverbank were also quiet, and there was no shadow of a man to bring sorrow to the young, beautiful her.
To distract from boredom, she thought to walk home and coming to a street corner in Kitahama, she bumped into Reiko, a waitress who had been at a bar in Ueroku. She was holding a baby girl. Before Yasu-ko quit, among the regulars coming to the shop, she had married a serious man and it had been about over a year.
"Yasu-chan, how are you doing?"
"I'm just loafing around like this. How are things with you and Koyama-san?"
"I'm a selfish person like this, he's almost pitiable."
"Isn't it a cute child?"
"Looks just like the father, right? My younger sister Toshiko also married a month after me, and now is running a coffee shop in Abeno. Since she uses two girls and it's relatively popular, if you go that way, please stop by."
"Everyone has settled down and things are in good condition."
"And then there's Kane-chan. He's great. He went back to the countryside with Tashiro-san and is farming."
"Heh, that Kane-chan?"
That Kane-chan, a drunkard just like Yasu-san—that Kane-chan who loved flashiness, doing serious farming, was a surprising story.
(Men look down on such dear things) she thought, but because he is the naturally kind Ikuta-kun, to Kuniko's summoning phone call:
"Ah, ... I'll go. The usual place, right? Yeah, yeah, okay ... goodbye."
With seven thousand five hundred yen a month, there is no reason for pocket money to remain until the payday of the 25th. Today is the 20th. Ah, how sad, no matter how many times he counts in his pocket, thirty-eight yen.
(With this pocket [money], how can I have a rendezvous with her, Kuniko-san?!)
Even though he can meet her in a few hours because she finally called him, he (without knowing a person's feelings, to call on the 20th of the month, is really looking down on a person).
Ikuta-kun, from the phone call just now, became completely irritated.
(Speaking of the 20th of the month, it's the hardest time for a salaryman, so even the most stubborn debt collector knows that. Furthermore, even if she's a woman, Kuniko knows the taste of being a salaryman; there's no way she doesn't suspect the state of my pocket. Damn, she's mocking me.)

**A Curious Tale of a Rendezvous**
**The Laughter of the Thousand-Yen Bill** — by Eriya Obiichi

With a piercing gaze, the proprietress pulled the man and woman aside.
"What on earth was that display last night? It was disgraceful. To behave like that while my own relatives were watching—it reflects poorly on me and this house."
"What exactly are you accusing me of?" the woman shot back. "Master T was poking around and it tickled, so I made a bit of a scene. We were all sleeping in one big heap—who’s going to try anything lewd in a crowd like that?"
"I’m not saying you *did* anything," the owner replied. "But in this business, appearances matter all the more. I won't have such indecorous behavior. And you, Master T—behaving like a child at your age!"
Master T simply sat there with a greasy smirk. "I didn't actually do anything, so there's no need to be so sore about it, is there?"
"Master T is at fault, but so are you," the owner turned back to the girl. "For the sake of the others, Yasu, I’m letting you go."
The words were polite, but the dismissal was cold and final. Yasu didn't care; she wasn't starving, and she certainly didn't need to stay in a place like that. She packed her things and went home.

Back home, she spent her days haunting dance halls and drinking her way through the nights. Soon, she began to suffer from evening fevers and a persistent lethargy. A doctor diagnosed her with advancing pleurisy. Fearful for her health, she dutifully quit the dancing and the drinking. As she recovered, a profound loneliness began to settle over her. On a day when she felt particularly well, she wandered down to Nakanoshima, a place she once frequented.

It was a brilliant Sunday in October. It seemed the whole city had fled to the suburbs, leaving the park hushed and forgotten. Not a single rental boat disturbed the surface of the river. From the bridge, Osaka Castle stood in silent, distant majesty. The familiar Osaka landscape felt startlingly beautiful, and she stood for a long time, lost in the view. The riverside tennis courts were deserted; no man was there to cast a shadow over her youth.

Walking toward Kitahama to kill time, she bumped into Reiko, a former waitress from a bar in Ueroku. Reiko was cradling a baby girl. She had married a steady man—one of the regulars—over a year ago, shortly before Yasu had quit her own job.
"Yasu-chan! How have you been?"
"Oh, just drifting along as usual," Yasu replied. "How are you and Mr. Koyama?"
"You know me—I'm as headstrong as ever. I almost feel sorry for the poor man."
"She's a darling child, isn't she?"
"Spitting image of her father. My sister Toshiko married a month after I did, too. She’s running a cafe in Abeno now. She’s got two girls working for her and it's doing quite well. If you're ever in the neighborhood, do drop in."
"It sounds like everyone has settled down nicely," Yasu remarked.
"Oh, and did you hear about Kane-chan? He’s really turned things around. He went back to the country with Tashiro and they’re farming now."
"Kane-chan? Farming?" Yasu was floored. To think that Kane-chan—the flashy, heavy-drinking Kane-chan—was now a serious man of the soil was a shock.

(Men really have a way of taking precious things for granted,) she mused.
Meanwhile, the ever-gentle Ikuta-kun answered a call from a girl named Kuniko.
"Hello? ... Yeah, I'll be there. The usual place? Right, got it. See you soon."
On a salary of 7,500 yen a month, there was no hope of having a spare cent left by the 20th, five days before payday. He reached into his pocket and counted his coins for the umpteenth time: thirty-eight yen. 
*How the hell am I supposed to go on a date with Kuniko with thirty-eight yen?* 
He had wanted to see her, but now that the meeting was set, he felt a surge of resentment. *Calling me on the 20th... she's got a lot of nerve.* He grew increasingly bitter. *Every debt collector in the city knows the 20th is the hardest time for a salaryman. Kuniko works for a living too; she knows exactly what my pockets look like right now. Damn it—she's mocking me.*

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This is a standard page from a Japanese "B6" or "A5" sized literary or general-interest magazine.
*   **Typography:** The text is set in traditional vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading right to left. It uses a mix of Mincho-style font for the body text. 
*   **Headline/Title:** The title "ランデブー・きたん" (Rendezvous *Kitan*) is stylized with a hand-drawn, slightly "ero-guro" or pulp-fiction aesthetic common in the post-war era. The sub-title "千圓札は笑う" (The Thousand Yen Bill Laughs) uses the archaic kanji for Yen (圓).
*   **Illustrations:** A simple line drawing shows a man and a woman in what appears to be swimsuits or undergarments, lounging in a modern, westernized pose. This suggests a theme of modern romance or social "play."
*   **Column Structure:** The page is divided into multiple vertical columns, which is the standard layout for Japanese magazines. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is large and centered at the top, followed by the author's name. The story begins immediately after, with dialogue breaks providing visual "breathing room" in the dense text blocks.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Post-War Era (c. 1946–1952):** The mention of "7,500 yen" as a monthly salary and "38 yen" in a pocket places this firmly in the post-war inflationary period. By the late 1940s, 7,000–8,000 yen was a typical monthly salary for a mid-level office worker (salaryman).
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** The tone—mixing city life, mild eroticism, and a sense of "nansensu" (nonsense/absurdist humor)—is typical of *Kasutori* magazines. These were cheap, pulp magazines that flourished briefly after the war, named after a harsh dregs-liquor because the magazines often disappeared after three issues (just as three cups of the liquor would "kill" you).
*   **Osaka Geography:** The text mentions specific locations in Osaka: **Nakanoshima** (a park and administrative center), **Kitahama** (the financial district), **Ueroku** (Uehommachi 6-chome), and **Abeno**. This gives the story a "Kamigata" (Kansai) flavor.
*   **The 20th of the Month:** In Japan, paydays are traditionally the 25th. The "20th" became a cultural trope for the "starvation period" when salarymen were broke and had to survive on literal pocket change.
*   **Health (Pleurisy):** The mention of *rokumaku* (pleurisy/pleuritis) reflects the commonality of respiratory illnesses in post-war Japan, often related to tuberculosis or poor living conditions.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ランデブー (Rendezvous):** A loanword from French via English. In this era, it specifically meant a romantic date, often with a slightly clandestine or modern connotation.
*   **きたん (奇譚/Kitan):** A strange tale or a curious anecdote. It suggests the story will have an ironic or unusual twist.
*   **切口上 (Kirikōjō):** A stiff, formal, or blunt way of speaking, often used when dismissing someone or making a final statement.
*   **女給 (Jokyū):** A bar waitress or "hostess." In the early 20th century, this was a common occupation for young women in urban centers.
*   **いい塩梅 (Ii anbai):** In good condition; going well. 
*   **百姓 (Hyakushō):** Farmer. In this context, it implies a "return to the soil" (*tsuchi ni kaeru*), a common theme for those who failed in the city or sought a simpler life after the war.
*   **なめとる (Nametoru):** From *nameru* (to lick/to underestimate/to mock). In Kansai dialect, it means "to look down on" or "to treat with contempt."
*   **畜生 (Chikushō):** Literally "beast," but used as a common curse word like "Damn it!" or "Son of a...!"

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Disillusionment and Survival:** The characters are "drifting" (*bura-bura*). The woman Yasu loses her job easily and wanders the city. There is a sense of transient relationships and economic instability.
*   **The "Salaryman" Struggle:** The second half of the text highlights the pathetic reality of the white-collar worker. Despite the fancy title of "Rendezvous," the protagonist Ikuta is paralyzed by having only 38 yen. It mocks the gap between romantic ideals and harsh economic reality.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The women in the story seem somewhat more resilient or adaptable—moving from bars to marriage, or starting cafes. The man, Ikuta, is portrayed as neurotic and sensitive about his financial status, perceiving the woman’s invitation as a personal slight to his pride.
*   **Nostalgia and Urban Beauty:** The description of Osaka Castle and Nakanoshima provides a "serene" contrast to the messy, "dirty" social interactions (the fight at the beginning, the drinking in dance halls).

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
