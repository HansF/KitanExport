ストリッパー  裸体物 大流行時代

**[Main Body - Top Left]**
裸、裸、裸。世はまさに裸体物流行時代。終戦後一世を風靡したストリップ・ショーは、有爲轉變の激しい芸能界に於て依然として、絶大な人気を持ち続け、裏枯れで青息吐息の小屋も、ストリップのかかる所だけは満員の盛況といった有様である。
　それかあらぬか、アトラクションにりべらるるショーをサービスする館迄現れるに至つた。
　目先を追うことに於て、人後に落ちない、映画製作者が、何んで、此れを捨てゝおこうか。
　なんとか、かんとか、口づけて、無理に裸をならべる作品を案出し出した。

素裸の狂女
明石三平 原作
映画ファン待望の

曰く、「裸の天使」「密林の女豹」「野性」と、女の肉体をズラリと揃えて、何んとかして、ストリップ愛好の客を吸収せんものの大詰である。
　普通作品の筋を替えてなんでも、裸をスクリーンに出させようという姑息的な手段が、斯くゆうストリッパーの特別出演とは相成つたのである。
　こんな中途半端な映画ではなくて、最初からズバリと裸を主題に持つて来ようとゆうのが、大胆奔放、今迄にその例を見ない超感能映画。
　明石三平原作「素裸の狂女」である。

**[Right Column]**
女相撲
江戸時代——延享、明和、天明の頃——盛んに行われた一種の見世物に女相撲がある。
　文政九年の三月、江戸は上野山下（現在の上野停車場附近）で興行されたものは、なんと盲人と女の珍相撲であつた。
「奇態流行史」の記するところによると、双方東西に分れて、男女力士十一名づつ、女は乳母や淫賣婦上りの年増婦ばかりであつたが、珍しい興行だというので、大評判、連日大人満員の繁昌を極めたそうである。
　女相撲の興行は、その後各地で行われたが、明治二十三年十一月東京両国回向院内で行われたとき、余り醜態だというので、警察廳が禁止の命令を下したのである。其の後一時後を絶つたが、何時しか又それが復活して震災前までは浅草奥山にその常設所まで出来たが、大正十二年九月一日の関東大震災と共に、永久にその姿を消した。

**[Bottom Section]**
彼女の失態
　秋の夜は涼しくて気持ちがよい。私は相思相愛の彼女と薄暗い公園の小道を辿つていた。
　彼女とのこうしたランデブーは数々の甘い思い出を残して私の胸に宿つていた。
　喫茶店、映画、ハイキング、海水浴、しかし愉しみ深い二人の唇は、まだ一度も触れ合ったことはなかつた。

（挿絵横の文）
ちょっとまってネ

　夜はようやく更けて、月は愈々冴え渡つた。木の間を洩れる月の光は、私の心をみやしくときめかした。
　大きな欅の木の下にあるベンチには、しっとりと夜露が下りていた。このあたりは一入樹が茂つて暗かつた。
　私は今宵こそ、思いを果たそうと心に鞭を打ちベンチに強んで腰かけた彼女の肩にそっと手をかけた。
　彼女も何を期待に満ちた眼付ながら處女の本能は思わず身を固くするのであった。
　今まさに私の唇が彼女の願いに迫らんとしたこの時であった。夜の寂けさを破って、音高く一發、出すべからざるものを彼女は洩してしまった。
　私は抱き締める手をゆるめて、静かに立ち上った。月は只、何にも知らぬげに、冴えていた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Headline:** Stripper: Nudity Genre Great Popularity Era.

**Main Body:** Naked, naked, naked. The world is truly in an era of nudity popularity. The strip shows that dominated the world after the war's end, in the entertainment world of intense vicissitudes, still continue to hold absolute popularity; even theaters gasping for breath in withered desolation are in a state of full-house success only where stripping is shown. Because of that or not, even movie theaters providing liberal shows as attractions have appeared. Movie producers, who do not fall behind others in chasing immediate trends, how could they leave this alone? With this or that excuse, they devised works that forcibly line up naked bodies.

**Sidebar:** The Stark Naked Madwoman. Original by Sanpei Akashi. Long-awaited by movie fans. They say, with "Naked Angel," "Wild Leopard of the Jungle," "Wildness," they line up female bodies to somehow absorb the strip-loving customers. The makeshift method of changing the plot of ordinary works to get nudity on screen has resulted in these special appearances by strippers. Rather than such half-baked movies, the idea to put nudity as the theme straight from the start is the bold and uninhibited, unprecedented super-sensual movie: "The Stark Naked Madwoman" by Sanpei Akashi.

**Right Column:** Female Sumo. In the Edo period—around Enkyo, Meiwa, Tenmei—as a kind of spectacle, there was female sumo. In March of Bunsei 9, a performance held at Ueno Yamashita was, amazingly, a strange sumo match between blind men and women. According to the "History of Strange Trends," they split into East and West, 11 male and female wrestlers each. The women were all older women who were former wet nurses or prostitutes, but because it was a rare performance, it was highly appraised and reached peak prosperity with daily full houses. Performances continued elsewhere, but in November of Meiji 23 at Ryogoku Eko-in, the Police Agency issued a ban because it was too scandalous. It disappeared for a time, but revived and had a permanent theater at Asakusa Okuyama until the earthquake, then vanished forever with the Great Kanto Earthquake on Sept 1, Taisho 12.

**Bottom Section:** Her Fumble. The autumn night is cool and feels good. I was following a dark park path with my girlfriend in mutual love. These rendezvous with her stayed in my heart as many sweet memories. Coffee shops, movies, hiking, sea bathing, but our pleasure-filled lips had not yet touched once. (Wait a moment). The night deepened, the moon grew clearer. The moonlight leaking through trees made my heart throb. On the bench under the large zelkova tree, night dew had fallen moistly. This area was especially dark with thick trees. Deciding to fulfill my desire tonight, I put my hand on the shoulder of her who sat on the bench. She had eyes full of expectation, but her virgin instincts made her stiffen. Just as my lips approached her wish, at that moment, breaking the night silence, with a loud sound, one blast, she leaked something that should not be let out. I loosened my embrace and quietly stood up. The moon just shone clearly, as if knowing nothing.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Headline: The Golden Age of the Striptease: A Nudity Craze**

**Introduction:** It’s nothing but skin, skin, and more skin. We are living in the absolute heyday of the "nudity genre." The strip shows that took the nation by storm after the war continue to reign supreme in the fickle world of show business. While other playhouses are withered and gasping their last breath, any venue featuring a striptease is guaranteed a packed house. Consequently, even movie theaters have begun offering "liberal" live shows as added attractions. Naturally, movie producers—never ones to miss a trend—aren't about to let this opportunity slip by. They are churning out films that manage, by hook or by crook, to parade as much nudity as possible across the screen.

**Feature Preview: *The Stark Naked Madwoman***
*Original Story by Sanpei Akashi – A Must-See for Movie Fans*
With titles like *Naked Angel*, *Jungle Leopard*, and *Wildness*, producers are lining up female talent in a desperate bid to capture the strip-show audience. Until now, the tactic has been a cheap one: shoehorning "special guest" strippers into ordinary plots just to get some skin on the screen. But forget those half-hearted efforts. We are now seeing the arrival of a bold, uninhibited, and unprecedented "super-sensual" film that makes nudity its central theme from the very first frame: Sanpei Akashi’s *The Stark Naked Madwoman*.

**Historical Feature: The History of Female Sumo**
Female sumo was a popular form of "spectacle" during the mid-Edo period (the mid-1700s). In 1826, a truly bizarre exhibition was held in Ueno featuring matches between blind men and women. According to the *History of Strange Trends*, the teams were divided into East and West with eleven wrestlers each. The women were mostly older, former wet nurses or prostitutes, but the sheer novelty of the show made it a sensation, drawing capacity crowds every day. While female sumo continued in various regions, the police finally banned it in 1890 following a "scandalous" performance at Ryogoku. It eventually saw a brief revival in Asakusa, but the tradition vanished forever in the wake of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923.

**Short Story: Her Unfortunate Blunder**
The autumn night was cool and refreshing as I walked with my beloved along a dim path in the park. Our many dates—the cafes, the movies, the hikes, the trips to the beach—remained in my heart as a collection of sweet memories. Yet, for all our shared joy, our lips had never once met. 

As the night deepened, the moon shone with a piercing brilliance, its light filtering through the branches and making my heart race. We found a bench beneath a massive zelkova tree, damp with the evening dew. In the deep shadows of the foliage, I decided that tonight would be the night. I steeled myself and gently placed my arm around her shoulders. Her eyes were filled with anticipation, though a certain maidenly instinct seemed to make her tense up. 

Just as my lips were about to meet hers, the silence of the night was shattered. With a sudden, resounding "blast," she accidentally let slip something that should never be released in polite company. I slowly loosened my embrace and stood up in silence. Above us, the moon continued to shine, indifferent and serene.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page uses a classic vertical Japanese layout common in mid-century magazines. The typography is a mix of bold, hand-drawn titles (like "ストリッパー") and standard movable type for the body.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The main headline is at the top, followed by a sensationalist editorial on the "Nudity Craze." A sidebar promotes a specific movie/story (*The Stark Naked Madwoman*). The right side is dedicated to a historical "educational" column (Female Sumo), while the bottom third is a fictional short story.
*   **Illustrations:** The page features three distinct styles of illustration: 
    1.  A semi-abstract line drawing of a nude woman (top left).
    2.  A traditional-style sketch of female sumo wrestlers (center right).
    3.  A more modern, cartoonish sketch of a man at a park bench and a "W.C." (water closet) sign with a dog (bottom), adding a humorous/ribald tone to the short story.
*   **Graphic Elements:** Decorative borders (scalloped edges) separate the sections. The text "カラー・セクション" (Color Section) is written vertically in large, bold katakana on the left, though the print itself is monochrome (common in "pulp" magazines that promised color but delivered newsprint).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture (1940s-50s):** The term "Kasutori" (named after a cheap, dregs-based sake) referred to the explosion of pulp magazines after WWII. These magazines focused on the "3S" (Screen, Sex, Sports) and provided cheap entertainment to a population recovering from the war.
*   **The Striptease Phenomenon:** After the surrender in 1945, censorship regarding nudity relaxed significantly. Strip shows became a massive industry, often serving as a gateway to broader sexual liberation (and exploitation) in the Japanese media.
*   **Onna-zumo (Female Sumo):** The text correctly identifies that female sumo existed as *misemono* (sideshows). While professional sumo is male-only, these historical exhibitions were often ribald or featured marginalized groups (like the blind), as mentioned in the text.
*   **The Great Kanto Earthquake (1923):** This event is often cited in Japanese literature as a "reset" button that ended various Edo-era traditions that had lingered into the early 20th century.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **有為転変 (Uitenpen):** A Buddhist-derived term meaning the mutability of all things; the constant flux of life.
*   **青息吐息 (Aoiki-toiki):** To be in great distress; to gasp with difficulty. Used here to describe theaters struggling financially.
*   **姑息 (Kosoku):** Usually means "makeshift" or "temporary" in this context, rather than the modern "cowardly."
*   **超感能 (Chō-kannō):** "Super-sensual" or "Super-erotic." A hyperbolic marketing term typical of the era.
*   **淫賣婦 (Imbaifu):** An archaic, derogatory term for a prostitute.
*   **出すべからざるもの (Dasubekarazaru mono):** "That which should not be let out." A euphemism for flatulence (farting).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Sensationalism vs. Education:** The magazine mixes "low-brow" erotica (the striptease report and the park story) with "pseudo-intellectual" history (the sumo article) to provide a veneer of respectability or simply to appeal to a wider variety of male interests.
*   **Post-War Libido:** The text reflects a society obsessed with "liberation" after years of wartime austerity. The "Naked Madwoman" title suggests a fascination with the "wild" and "unrestrained" female form.
*   **Bathos:** The short story "Her Fumble" utilizes *bathos*—a sudden transition from the sublime (romantic moonlight) to the ridiculous (a loud fart). This was a common trope in pulp humor.
