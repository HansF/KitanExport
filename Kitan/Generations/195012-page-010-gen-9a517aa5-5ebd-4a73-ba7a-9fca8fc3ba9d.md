**Headline:**
蜘蛛男（くもをとこ）と章魚娘（たこむすめ）

**Main Text:**
一寸法師の蜘蛛男福助は、江戸両国に小屋を張つて、いろ／＼な見世物を興行してゐた香具師の中でも、相当古顔の愛嬌者であつた。因果物の中でも、福助は、あの気味の悪い鶏娘だの、緋縮緬の湯文字の間から見えかくれする白い股を命として、僅に好奇の客をよんでゐる汚しい足藝の手なし女等と違つて、いつも水染の手拭をかぶつて、陽氣な手踊りを見せたり、新作の瀬戸節などを唄つて面白おかしく、朗らかにその日、その日を送つてゐた。

福助は自分が太夫であると同時に、太夫元でもあつたから、小屋からあがる木戸銭は、諸経費を引いた残りが皆三尺にも足りない小さい彼の懐に入つてくるのであつた。

いつもの年ならば、夏になると、両国も人出だけは夥しかつたが、美しい女のゐる水茶屋へばかり客をとられて、見世物といふ見世物は、閑古鳥が鳴く仕末だが、文政二年の夏ばかりは例外であつた。

回向院での嵯峨清涼寺の釈迦如来の御開帳を目あてに広小路へ出たどの見世物も、落ちこぼれなく繁昌したが、その中でも、人気の蜘蛛男は、連日の大入で、客止めをするような、すばらしい景氣であつた。

舞台では、その頃、江戸で新らしい流行であつた叶福助の扮装で、頭へ大きな髷をかぶり桃色の袂をつけた福助が、この盛況にすつかり満足しきつていた。

今住んでゐる、薬研堀の家を買つたのも、この年の御開帳で、自分の小屋が大当りに当つたからであつた。

その翌年の六月にも、同じ回向院に、信州善光寺の阿弥陀如来の御開帳があつた。

この時も、両国は物凄い人出で、福助の小屋も去年程はなかつたが、とにかく毎日大入を続けることが出来た。

この両度の御開帳は、両国の見世物を潤したばかりでなく今迄江戸の見世物といへば殆んど怪奇な因果物か、覗きからくりの類であつたものが、大仕掛の細工物の見世物がめつきり増えて来たことであつた。

先づ広小路には針金細工といつて、花鳥人物、草木虫魚を巧みに、針金で作つたもの、回向院の境内には、丸竹細工、貝細工、瀬戸物細工、人形細工、ゼンマイ仕掛の造り物迄あつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Spider Man and Octopus Girl**

The "one-inch priest" Spider-Man Fukusuke, among the barkers/showmen who pitched tents in Edo's Ryogoku and performed various spectacles, was a considerably old-timer charming person. Among the "karmic shows" (freak shows), Fukusuke—unlike those gross "chicken girls" or the dirty "armless women" who did leg-arts and invited only a few curious guests by making a life out of white thighs peeking from between scarlet crepe loincloths—always wore a water-dyed hand-towel on his head, showed cheerful hand-dances, sang new Seto-bushi songs, and spent his days amusingly and brightly.

Because Fukusuke was the star performer and at the same time the troupe leader, the entrance fees coming from the tent—after subtracting various expenses—all entered into the pockets of his small body, which was not even three shaku tall.

In a normal year, when summer came, Ryogoku had massive crowds, but customers were all taken by the teahouses with beautiful women, and as for the spectacles, the "cuckoo sang" (it was dead business); however, only the summer of Bunsei 2 was an exception.

Aiming for the public unveiling (Gokaincho) of the Shakyamuni Buddha of Saga Seiryo-ji Temple at Eko-in, every spectacle that came out to the Hirokoji thrived without exception; among them, the popular Spider-Man had full houses every day, a wonderful business that even required stopping more guests from entering.

On the stage, Fukusuke—dressed in the costume of "Kano Fukusuke" which was a new fashion in Edo at that time, wearing a large topknot on his head and pink sleeves—was completely satisfied with this prosperity.

The fact that he bought the house in Yagenbori where he now lives was also because his own tent hit a big jackpot during this year's unveiling.

In June of the following year, at the same Eko-in, there was an unveiling of the Amitabha Buddha of Shinshu Zenko-ji Temple.

At this time too, Ryogoku had incredible crowds, and while Fukusuke’s tent wasn’t as busy as the previous year, he was able to continue "Full House" signs every day anyway.

These two unveilings did not just enrich Ryogoku’s spectacles; whereas Edo's spectacles until then had mostly been bizarre "karmic shows" or peep-shows, large-scale craftwork spectacles increased remarkably.

First, at Hirokoji, there was "wire-work"—flowers, birds, people, plants, insects, and fish skillfully made of wire—and inside the grounds of Eko-in, there were bamboo-work, shell-work, ceramic-work, doll-work, and even spring-loaded clockwork creations.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Spider-Man and the Octopus Girl**

Fukusuke, the diminutive "Spider-Man," was a well-known and beloved fixture among the showmen who pitched their tents in the Ryogoku district of Edo. While many "freak shows" relied on the grotesque—like the unsettling "Chicken Girl" or armless women performing leg tricks while teasing the audience with flashes of thigh—Fukusuke was different. He was a cheerful soul who wore a simple dyed cloth over his head, performing lively dances and singing the latest folk songs to keep his audience in stitches. He lived his life with a brightness that set him apart from the darker side of the carnival world.

Being both the star of the show and its proprietor, every copper of the entrance fees—after overhead was paid—went straight into the pockets of his tiny, three-foot frame.

Usually, the sweltering Edo summers saw crowds flocking to the teahouses to ogle beautiful waitresses, leaving the sideshow tents empty enough for "cuckoos to nest in." But the summer of the second year of the Bunsei era (1819) was different. A grand religious unveiling at the Eko-in temple brought massive crowds to the district. Every show on the main strip flourished, but none so much as the Spider-Man. Business was so good he had to turn people away at the door.

Fukusuke took to the stage dressed as the then-trendy "Kano Fukusuke" good-luck doll, sporting an oversized topknot and flamboyant pink sleeves. He basked in the glory of his success. In fact, it was the windfall from that single season that allowed him to buy his current home in Yagenbori.

The following June, another grand unveiling—this time for the Amida Buddha of Zenko-ji—brought the crowds back to Ryogoku. While the frenzy wasn't quite as intense as the year before, Fukusuke still hung the "Sold Out" sign every night. 

These two festivals marked a turning point for Edo’s entertainment scene. The industry shifted away from the macabre "karmic" freak shows and simple peep-boxes toward elaborate, large-scale craftsmanship. The promenades were soon filled with intricate wire sculptures of birds and flowers, while the temple grounds hosted marvelous displays of bamboo, shell, and ceramic art—and even complex, spring-powered clockwork automatons.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Composition:** The page uses a multi-layered layout typical of 1950s-60s Japanese "pulp" magazines (*fuzoku zasshi*). It mixes high-contrast illustrations with dense vertical text.
*   **Typography:** 
    *   The main title is rendered in a stylized, hand-drawn font with a red background, mimicking the aesthetic of Edo-period theater posters (*banzuke*). 
    *   The body text uses a standard Mincho font but retains historical kana usage (*rekishiteki kanazukai*), such as using "ゐ" (wi) and "ゑ" (we), which suggests a publication date before the full standardization of modern orthography or a deliberate attempt to feel "classic."
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The eye is drawn first to the title, then to the large illustration of the semi-nude women (a classic "service" shot for the male readership), and finally to the smaller, more narrative illustrations of the performer Fukusuke.
*   **Illustration Style:** The art style is a hybrid. The depiction of the women has a clear 1950s/60s erotic *gekiga* influence, while the clothing and the depiction of Fukusuke lean into traditional *ukiyo-e* motifs.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Misemono (見世物):** These were sideshows popular in the Edo period. Ryogoku Hirokoji was the "Times Square" of Edo entertainment.
*   **Ingamono (因果物):** Literally "karmic things." These were freak shows where physical disabilities or deformities were explained to the audience as the result of "bad karma" from a previous life or a parent's sins. The text notes a shift away from this toward *Saiku-mono* (craftsmanship).
*   **Gokaincho (御開帳):** The "unveiling" of a sacred Buddhist statue that is normally hidden from the public. These events were massive tourist draws, turning temples into temporary carnivals.
*   **Fukusuke (福助):** A legendary figure based on a real person with dwarfism who became a symbol of good luck and prosperity. He is often depicted with a large head and a topknot, much like the "Kano Fukusuke" costume mentioned in the text.
*   **Ryogoku Eko-in (両国回向院):** A temple famous for hosting Sumo tournaments and major *misemono* festivals during the Edo period.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Kagushi (香具師):** A street performer, barker, or itinerant merchant. In this context, it refers to the organizers of the sideshow tents.
*   **Kido-sen (木戸銭):** Entrance fee or "gate money."
*   **Zentai-shikake (ゼンマイ仕掛):** Clockwork or spring-loaded mechanisms. This refers to *karakuri ningyo* (traditional Japanese robots/automata).
*   **Kanko-dori ga naku (閑古鳥が鳴く):** An idiom meaning "the cuckoos are singing," used to describe a business that is dead or has no customers.
*   **Oiri (大入):** A "Full House." Still used today in Sumo and Kabuki, often accompanied by "Oiri-fukuro" (bonus envelopes for staff).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Modernization of Entertainment:** The text frames the Bunsei era as a transition point where Japanese taste moved from "grotesque" spectacles (freak shows) to "technological" and "artistic" spectacles (wire art, clockwork).
*   **Eroticism and Nostalgia:** The inclusion of "Octopus Girl" and the semi-nude women in the art, contrasted with the historical text, suggests this was produced for a "low-brow" adult male audience (pulp magazines) that enjoyed "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense).
*   **Success Story:** There is an underlying narrative of the "underdog" (the dwarf Fukusuke) achieving financial independence and social standing through wit and talent rather than just being a "curiosity."
