## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**How to Become Close with Unknown Women Instantly**
**—Professor of Fast Lover-Making Method—**

**I. Appearance**
(Face is a human's signboard)
Girls who easily become "something" [i.e., easy to get], namely girls who are shy, belong to the following types. It is true.
- Body: Medium size or below. Too big is no good. Chest, arms, shoulders are not very fat, but the lower body is developed.
- Skin color: Swarthy, yellowish-brown system.
- Face shape: Round face, in short, a compact one.
- Eyebrows: Thin. Shaved or plucked?
- Eyes: Thin and long-slit, eyelids are thick.
- Nose: Not high, tip is somewhat upward-facing.
- Cheeks: Cheekbones are sticking out.
- Lips: Thick, red (if using lipstick, it's unknown), upper lip is curled back.
- Teeth: Thin and white.
- Voice: Middle tone (Alto).
- Head: Round and abundant.
- Other characteristics: Downy hair is many, hair at the temples is swirling. Hair has somewhat reddish tint.
Summarizing, at first glance innocent, but somewhere audacious, a face that seems to have a quirk.

**II. Season**
(Period should be chosen)
Urban hunting season is not specially fixed, but from spring to summer is good. When humans wear thin clothes, feelings somehow become open. Because it is so, ahem.

**III. Weather**
(Look at weather forecast)
In becoming friends, weather relates greatly. Fishermen and hunters first glare at the sky and deliberate. A clear sunny day is superb.
Even if blue sky is clear, windy days are no good. Women, more than men, care about their skirts and hair. As an exception to utilize, there are sudden rain days (see Example 4).

**IV. Time**
(Punctuality)
In the countryside, daytime, however long stays are no good. If city, afternoon is fine. Afternoon is from noon to evening.

**V. Situation**
(Put care into care [Be very careful])
This is important. "That person, isn't he a delinquent boy?"
Giving such a preoccupation or letting her hold anxiety is failure. Movie theater's...

---
**V. Revenge Plot**
"Oho... even the hunchback of Notre Dame is a better man than you, oho, it's chilling, go away over there quickly."
She cruelly pulled me out and pushed me hard onto the asphalt pavement outside. My big Fukusuke-head unfortunately bumped into a utility pole, and in the end of ends, I hit my nose on a paving stone and red blood quickly came out.

A night when a moon like a drunkard was floating hollowly.
While smoking smuggled opium, I was entranced and continued thinking solemnly of a terrible revenge against her.
Despite being a person with disabilities, I, who excessively like the works of Conan Doyle and Allan Poe, am a man like a sleepwalker who even thinks of visiting Sherlock Holmes's office in Paris once.
I devised a murder method to completely erase her from this earth, without leaving even a single strand of hair.
Then, ten days later, one night.
I set a ladder to the attic of the hotel next door, hollowed it out, and made it so I could sneak from my house to her house freely.
How much trouble I had making this secret passage! At the dead of night, watching for people to fall asleep and doing it tap-tap, how many times did I become soaked with sweat and prick up my large ears. When this passage was completely finished, out of joy I let out a loud "Gera-gera" hollow laugh and was startled by myself.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Art of Instant Intimacy with Strangers**
**—A Masterclass in Rapid Romance—**

**I. Physical Traits**
(The face is a person’s calling card)
Those young ladies who are "easy targets"—specifically the shy ones—generally fit a specific physical mold. Mark my words, this is the truth.
- **Physique:** Average height or shorter. Large women are best avoided. While the chest, arms, and shoulders are lean, the lower body is well-developed.
- **Complexion:** Dusky or yellowish-brown tones.
- **Face Shape:** Round and compact.
- **Eyebrows:** Thin—either naturally sparse, shaved, or plucked.
- **Eyes:** Narrow and almond-shaped with heavy lids.
- **Nose:** Not particularly high, with a slightly upturned tip.
- **Cheeks:** Prominent cheekbones.
- **Lips:** Full and red; the upper lip has a distinct upward curl.
- **Teeth:** Small, slender, and white.
- **Voice:** An alto or mid-range pitch.
- **Head:** Well-rounded and full.
- **Other Features:** Soft downy hair on the skin; hair at the temples that grows in swirls. The hair often has a reddish tint.
In summary: a face that appears innocent at first glance but harbors a stubborn, audacious streak.

**II. The Season**
(Timing is everything)
In the city, there is no official "hunting season," but spring through summer is ideal. As people shed their heavy winter layers, their dispositions naturally become more open and relaxed. Quite so, ahem!

**III. The Weather**
(Consult the forecast)
Atmospheric conditions play a vital role in forging a new friendship. Just as a fisherman or a hunter scrutinizes the horizon before setting out, you must check the sky. A bright, clear day is perfect. However, even under blue skies, avoid windy days; women are far more concerned with their hair and skirts than men are. One notable exception is a sudden rain shower, which can be used to your advantage.

**IV. Timing**
(Strict punctuality)
In rural areas, stick to the daytime—though do not overstay your welcome. In the city, the afternoon is best (defined here as noon until dusk).

**V. The Setting**
(Leave nothing to chance)
This is crucial. You must avoid labels like "Is he some kind of delinquent?" Creating such a negative first impression or inducing anxiety will lead to certain failure. In a movie theater...

---
**V. A Plot for Revenge**
"Ohoho! Even the Hunchback of Notre Dame is more handsome than you! Oh, the very thought of you makes my skin crawl. Now be gone with you, and make it quick!"
With a cruel lack of mercy, she dragged me out and shoved me onto the asphalt. My oversized head—shaped like a Fukusuke doll—was unlucky enough to crack against a utility pole. To make matters worse, I face-planted onto the paving stones, sending a spray of bright red blood from my nose.

It was a night where the moon hung in the sky like a staggering drunkard.
Lulled into a trance by smuggled opium, I sat in the shadows, somberly plotting a horrific revenge against her. Despite my physical deformities, I am a man obsessed with the works of Conan Doyle and Edgar Allan Poe—a sleepwalker of a fellow who once even entertained the notion of traveling to Paris to seek out Sherlock Holmes’s office.
I devised a method of murder so perfect that it would erase her from the face of the earth, leaving not so much as a single strand of hair behind.
Ten days passed. One night, I leaned a ladder against the attic of the adjacent hotel and carved a hole through the wall, creating a secret passage that allowed me to slip between her home and mine at will.
Oh, the toil I endured to construct that hidden crawlspace! Working in the dead of night, waiting for the world to fall silent, I would hammer away, drenched in sweat, my large ears twitching at every sound. When the passage was finally complete, I was so overcome with joy that I let out a hollow, manic cackle—a "Gera-gera" that echoed so loudly it startled even me.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Layout and Structure
The page is divided into two distinct sections by a heavy horizontal line. 
- **The Top Section** is formatted as an instructional article or "column" (indicated by the numbered headers I through V). It uses a list format with bullet points (circles) to categorize physical traits. 
- **The Bottom Section** is a narrative text, likely a short story or a serialized fiction piece. It is titled "V. Revenge Plot," which creates a dark, ironic parallel to the "V. Situation" header in the dating guide above.

### Typography and Design
- **Vertical Orientation:** The text is written in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left.
- **Headlines:** The main title and section headers are in a larger, bolder typeface to establish hierarchy.
- **Illustration:** The bottom left features a stylized, pulp-fiction-style illustration. It depicts a man (the protagonist of the story) with a somewhat grotesque or suspicious appearance, clutching a knife and looking through a hole. The style is reminiscent of the "Ero-Guro" (Erotic Grotesque) artistic movement popular in pre- and post-war Japan.
- **Iconography:** The top border features a decorative pattern of keys and keyholes, perhaps symbolizing "unlocking" the secrets of women or the "secret passage" mentioned in the story.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### Era (approx. 1945–1955)
The vocabulary and themes suggest the early post-war Showa era. During this time, "lifestyle magazines" for men often featured a mix of "modern" dating advice and sensationalist/pulp fiction.

### Social Conventions & Terminology
- **Nampa Culture:** The top section describes what is essentially *nampa* (street pickup). It treats women as "prey" to be "hunted" (using terms like *ryōki* or "hunting season"), reflecting the patriarchal and often predatory tone of men's magazines of that era.
- **Physiognomy:** The detailed breakdown of facial and body types suggests a lingering belief in physiognomy—the idea that a person's character can be judged by their physical features.
- **Literary References:** The mention of Conan Doyle, Edgar Allan Poe, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame reflects the "Mystery/Detective" (*tantei shōsetsu*) boom in Japan. Interestingly, the narrator wants to find Sherlock Holmes in *Paris*—a humorous error or a reflection of the character's delusional "sleepwalker" state (since Holmes is famously London-based).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

- **看板 (Kanban):** Literally "signboard." In this context, it refers to a person's face or outward appearance as their "advertisement" to the world.
- **福助アタマ (Fukusuke-atama):** Refers to a head shape resembling a *Fukusuke* doll—a traditional Japanese lucky charm depicting a man with a very large head and forehead. It implies the narrator has an oddly shaped, large head.
- **邪見 (Jaken):** An archaic or literary term for being cruel, cold-hearted, or viewing someone with prejudice.
- **阿片 (Ahen):** Opium. Its mention here serves to establish the narrator as a "decadent" or "depraved" literary figure, typical of the *Buraiha* (Decadent School) or detective fiction tropes.
- **丑満刻 (Ushimitsudoki):** The "hour of the ox," specifically the dead of night (roughly 2:00 to 2:30 AM), traditionally associated with ghosts and cursed activities.
- **ヒトクセありげ (Hitokuse-arige):** Having a "quirk" or being a "handful." Suggests a woman who isn't as innocent as she looks.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

### The Duality of Desire and Resentment
The page presents a jarring transition from a guide on how to seduce women (lust/attraction) to a story about a man plotting a gruesome murder after being rejected (resentment/misogyny). This reflects a common theme in mid-century pulp magazines: the fine line between the "modern man's" pursuit of romance and the "darker" impulses of the jilted ego.

### Erotic Grotesque (Ero-Guro)
The bottom story is a classic example of *Ero-Guro-Nansensu*. It features a physically "deformed" narrator, illegal drugs (opium), voyeurism (the secret passage), and a graphic description of a "perfect murder." The tone is manic and obsessive.

### Satire/Humor
The dating guide is written with a mock-authoritative tone ("Professor," "It is true!"), likely intended as "edutainment" for young men of the era. The "Ahem" (*Ehen*) at the end of sections adds a layer of performative masculinity.
