## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(I) did [that]. "To put it simply, in other words, [I am] a middleman. I am doing [the work of] a clothing broker, you see. Rude of me to ask, but you, sir, [what is] your business?" 
"Huh? A scrap merchant—meaning—hmm."
Kiku-zo was astonished; he peeled [wide] his protruding eyeballs and stared intently at Tomegichi’s profile as he was calmly blowing [hot air] like that.
It was dim and not clear, but when he thought he had seen that face somewhere, [he realized] it was "Scrap Tome." He remembered the figure dragging dirt-covered feet in board-like wooden clogs, wearing a peeling khaki-colored jacket and dirty patched trousers, walking "dara-dara" while carrying a large scrap basket on his back.
However, even Kiku-zo hated school and ran away from home without permission when he was in the sixth year of primary school; for twenty-five years since slipping into a kimono shop as an apprentice, he had changed jobs repeatedly, and just when one thought he was running a fish shop, before anyone knew it, he was riding a truck transporting manure buckets.
Even after the end of the war, he continues to run around from black-market stalls to broker to insurance agent, but money does not accumulate at all. As soon as a little lump sum of money comes in, he immediately buys furniture, orders feasts from restaurants, and treats friends generously. If he becomes completely penniless, he even sells off his loincloth.
Because of this temperament, women who became his wife run away in six months at the longest, or one week at the shortest. Thus, he is still single.
After that, Kiku-zo had never gone to Tomegichi’s house, but Tomegichi came over almost every day, and from around that time, Tomegichi had converted from scrap buying to being a "noble broker."
However, recently, clothing prices suddenly dropped, and because the goods had passed through Kiku-zo’s hands, they were about ten percent more expensive; therefore, Tomegichi’s business was ruined, and life for him and his wife, who lay around "goro-goro," had become destitute.
"If it stays like this, we will starve to death, so maybe I should start a roasted sweet potato shop—but I don't have a single cent of capital—and my wife isn't the type to have a single secret savings stash, either."
Thinking so, he was extremely envious that Kiku-zo just said he was starting a bar.

11. The Fox's Ring

Entering the ten-unit tenement house, which looked like old lunch boxes lined up, by rattling the lattice door, the place was three mats, the next room was also three mats, and the back was four-and-a-half mats. The back hit a wooden fence; it was a narrow, trash-filled yard and toilet where even a dog couldn't thrash around because its tail would rub.
When he came to the middle room, his wife, with her elbow as a pillow, had her rear turned this way, lying sprawled and bent like a shrimp.
"Okane! Wake up!"
It was a big difference from when he was talking to Kiku-zo at the bathhouse. With his arms folded, he used his foot to go "pon" and kick the rear of his wife, whose *appappa* dress was rolled up.
"Ah!"
The wife, Okane, jumped up in surprise, making her slanted eyes go "kyoto-" [blankly] and stared strangely at Tomegichi’s face, which looked like he had crushed a bitter insect.
"Oh, it was you. I thought I was a fox. Hey, I had a strange dream. Walking 'toto-koto' through a pitch-black pine forest, there was something flashing 'chika-' in the straw. When I peeked in to see what it was, what do you know, it was a diamond ring. Yes, a real one; I know because I was shown one once. So I was so happy, thinking if I had this I could live easily for a while, and when I tried to tuck it into my sash, a big fox was sitting there in the thicket facing me, wagging its thick tail 'pyon-pyon.' I was so shocked, I gave a 'kya!' scream and hit my rear so hard it woke me up. Oh, it hurt."
Saying so, she rubs her plump rear.
"I wondered what rot you were talking, but you're just half-asleep. I'm feeling 'muka-muka' [irritated] today. Come on, make rice quickly. Sprawling around 'goro-goro' every day."
"Oh? You, acting like a husband when it's not in your character, how can you say such things? I'm 'ira-ira' [irritated] because I want to earn money. Even now, didn't I have such a dream just because I want money? Are you telling me to be a beggar from tomorrow? You incompetent, slowpoke. You spend five or ten days brooding over creating a single tiny profit-making opportunity. Useless. If it were me, I would have quit long ago and moved to another job, but you cling to the same work forever, 'not this, not that.' When I say I'll become a waitress, you get 'yaki-mochi' [jealous] even though it's not in your character. Look, your eyes are turning sharp. Isn't it so? If you aren't jealous, why do you stop me?"
Okane made her face go stiff with dirt, and while scratching her grease-less hair 'goshi-goshi,' she let out a barrage in a *dempō* [tough] tone trained from her life as a waitress. Tomegichi, who was slow of speech, had no room to cut in; he sat cross-legged with a thud and listened. Finally, the spearhead was lowered, so immediately—
"Hey!"
Shouting as if thwacking the enemy’s crown "hasshi," he seized the initiative.
"Don't talk like you know everything! A monster like you, whether you become a waitress or a *pan-suke* [prostitute], why would I feel any jealousy?"
"Well—you really said it, didn't you? A monster?"
"Now, now, don't get angry. It was just a slip of the tongue."
"Stop it. Sure, my eyes are slanted so I look like a fox monster, but who was the one who fell for such a woman? It was you, with your swollen, poverty-stricken face, wasn't it? I was a fool too. Hungry all year round, ahhh, I’d rather just hang myself and die."
Okane, on top of a futon with cotton sticking out, with her arms (plump for a forty-year-old) exposed, leaned on her elbows, put her face on her limp hands, and began to cry.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

...is what I told him. "To put it plainly, I’m a middleman. I work as a clothing broker, you see. Pardon me for asking, but what’s your line of work, sir?"
"Huh? A ragman? You mean... I see."
Kiku-zo was floored. His eyes nearly popped out of his head as he stared at the profile of Tomegichi, who sat there calmly spinning his tall tales.
In the dim light, he couldn't quite place him at first, but then it clicked: this was "Scrap-heap Tome." He remembered the sight of him dragging his feet—filthy and calloused in wooden clogs—wearing a faded khaki jacket and patched-up trousers, hauling a massive wicker scrap-basket on his back as he shuffled along.
Yet Kiku-zo was hardly one to talk. He’d hated school and run away from home in the sixth grade. In the twenty-five years since he’d first apprenticed at a drapery shop, he had drifted from one job to the next. He’d be a fishmonger one day and a night-soil collector the next.
Even now, after the war, he was still scrambling—from the black market to brokerage to insurance—but he never seemed to save a dime. The moment he came into a bit of cash, he’d blow it on new furniture, lavish meals, or treating his friends. When he was finally tapped out, he’d sell the very loincloth off his back. 
With a lifestyle like that, no wife lasted more than six months—some barely made it a week. So, he remained a bachelor.
Kiku-zo hadn't visited Tomegichi's place since then, but Tomegichi started coming around nearly every day. It was then that Tomegichi had abandoned the rag trade to "elevate" himself to a clothing broker.
Lately, however, the price of clothing had plummeted. Because Tomegichi’s goods had passed through Kiku-zo first, they were marked up by ten percent, making them impossible to move. Tomegichi’s business had withered, and he and his wife—who did little but lounge about all day—were soon facing destitute poverty.
"At this rate, we'll starve. Maybe I should start a roasted sweet potato stand. But I haven't got a red cent of capital, and my wife isn't the sort to have a secret stash hidden away."
Envy gnawed at him when he heard Kiku-zo say he was going to open a bar.

**11. The Fox’s Ring**

He rattled the lattice door of the ten-unit tenement—a row of buildings that looked like a line of discarded lunch boxes—and stepped inside. The place consisted of two three-tatami rooms and a four-and-a-half-mat room in the back. The rear of the house abutted a wooden fence so closely that a dog couldn't even wag its tail without scraping the wood. It was a cramped, filthy dwelling with a tiny, trash-strewn yard and a toilet.
In the middle room, he found his wife sprawled out like a curled shrimp, her head pillowed on her arm and her backside turned toward him.
"Okane! Wake up!"
She looked a far cry from the woman he’d just been describing to Kiku-zo at the bathhouse. Keeping his arms folded, he gave her backside—exposed where her muumuu had ridden up—a sharp kick with his foot.
"Ow!"
Okane bolted upright in surprise. Her slanted eyes darted about blankly before she fixed a look of pure disgust on Tomegichi.
"Oh, it’s only you. I thought a fox had got me. Listen, I had the strangest dream. I was walking through a pitch-black pine forest when I saw something sparkling in the straw. I peeked in, and wouldn't you know it? A diamond ring! A real one, too—I know 'em when I see 'em. I was so happy, thinking we’d finally be set, but as I went to tuck it into my sash, I saw a huge fox sitting in the brush, watching me and wagging its thick tail. It scared the life out of me. I let out a scream and hit the floor so hard I woke up. God, it hurts."
She rubbed her fleshy hip as she spoke.
"I thought you were talking sense for once, but you're just half-asleep. I'm in a foul mood today. Get up and fix me some damn food. You do nothing but rot here all day."
"Oh? Listen to you, playing the big-shot husband. How dare you talk to me like that? I’m the one crawling out of my skin wanting to work! I only had that dream because I’m so desperate for cash. What do you want me to do, go beg in the streets? You incompetent slug. It takes you ten days just to figure out how to make a pittance. If it were me, I’d have quit that dead-end job and found something else months ago. But no, you stick to the same useless trade, making excuses. And then, when I say I'll go be a waitress, you get all jealous! Look at you, glaring at me. Don't lie—if you weren't jealous, why won't you let me work?"
Her face was tight with grime as she scratched her greasy hair, unleashing a torrent of abuse in the rough, street-smart dialect she’d picked up as a bar girl. Tomegichi, never one for quick retorts, couldn't find a word to throw back at her. He sat down heavily, cross-legged, and waited for her to run out of steam. The moment she paused, he struck.
"Hey!" he barked, as if clubbing an enemy over the head to seize the advantage. "Keep your trap shut! Why would I be jealous of a hag like you, whether you’re a waitress or a streetwalker?"
"A hag? You really said it, didn't you?"
"Now, now... don't get your dander up. It was just a slip of the tongue."
"Don't give me that. Fine, I've got slanted eyes, I look like a fox-hag. But who was the one who fell for this hag? It was you and your puffy, pathetic face! I was a fool to marry you. I’m hungry all year round. God, I’d be better off hanging myself."
Okane collapsed onto a futon that was leaking its cotton stuffing. Her arms, surprisingly plump for a woman of forty, were bare as she propped herself up on her elbows. She buried her face in her hands and began to sob.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography:** Set in a classic vertical *Mincho* (serif) font typical of Japanese mid-century publishing. The text uses small tsu (っ) and small ya/yu/yo, though some older orthographic habits remain (like the wavy dash `〜`).
*   **Layout:** Two columns per page, a standard format for mass-market paperbacks or literary magazines (*Bungei-shi*).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the chapter, "一一、狐の指輪" (11. The Fox's Ring), is centered and given significant white space to indicate a section break.
*   **Punctuation:** Uses standard Japanese punctuation (periods, commas, quotation marks). Notable use of "〜" for drawn-out sounds in speech (e.g., `キョト〜`, `だら〜`).
*   **Column Structure:** The columns are densely packed with about 20-22 characters per line, optimized for rapid reading.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Reality:** The story mentions "after the end of the war" (*shūsen-go*). This was an era of extreme poverty, hyperinflation, and a thriving black market.
*   **Occupations:**
    *   **Broker (ブローカー):** In the post-war context, this often referred to people who middle-manned goods between black markets and desperate civilians.
    *   **Ragman/Scrap Merchant (屑屋 - Kuzuya):** A low-status job collecting and reselling scrap materials.
    *   **Nakai/Pan-suke:** Okane mentions wanting to be a *nakai* (waitress in a high-end restaurant/inn), but Tomegichi insults her by mentioning *Pan-suke* (prostitutes who catered to GIs). This reflects the limited and often stigmatized career options for women.
*   **Living Conditions:** The "ten-unit tenement" (*jukken-nagaya*) described as "folded lunch boxes" indicates the "moku-chin" (wooden rental) apartments common in Shitamachi areas. A 3-tatami room is tiny (approx. 5 square meters).
*   **"Fox" Imagery:** In Japanese folklore, foxes (*kitsune*) are tricksters that deceive humans, often by making leaves or scrap look like gold/jewelry. Okane’s dream of a diamond ring turned into a fox reflects the "mirage" of post-war wealth and the trickery of her own desperate mind.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **アッパッパ (Appappa):** A simple, sleeveless, loose-fitting dress popular in Japan from the 1920s through the 1950s. It was the "house dress" of the working class.
*   **伝法口調 (Dempō-kuchō):** A rough, assertive, and slightly masculine way of speaking associated with the Tokyo working class (Shitamachi). It implies the speaker is "street-smart" or "tough."
*   **パン助 (Pan-suke):** Derogatory slang for "Pan-pan girls," prostitutes who worked the streets during the Allied occupation.
*   **剥げちょろけ (Hagechoroke):** Colloquialism for something peeling, worn out, or shabby.
*   **肥桶 (Koe-oke):** Buckets used for collecting human waste (night soil) to be used as fertilizer. Transporting these was considered one of the lowest forms of labor.
*   **柄じゃない (Gara ja nai):** "Not in one's character" or "Doesn't suit one." Tomegichi and Okane use this to insult each other's attempts at dignity.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Illusion of Wealth:** The central motif is the "Fox's Ring." The diamond is a dream born of hunger and desperation. This subtextually critiques the "American Dream" or the unattainable luxury goods appearing in Japan after the war.
*   **Domestic Strife as Social Critique:** The argument between Tomegichi and Okane is not just about a dream; it’s about the failure of the male "breadwinner" role in post-war Japan. Tomegichi’s pride prevents his wife from working, even though they are starving.
*   **Class Mobility (or Lack Thereof):** The characters attempt to "rebrand" themselves (ragman to "broker"), but their physical environment and speech patterns betray their true social standing.
*   **The "Kasutori" Tone:** The writing style is reminiscent of *Kasutori* literature—gritty, decadent, and focused on the lives of the lower classes, often featuring sex, gambling, and black-market dealings.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Realism.
*   **Genre:** Post-war Literature (*Sengo Bungaku*), Shitamachi Fiction.
