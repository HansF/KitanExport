## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

「──えゝ、いつ迄も見捨てないで……」
　そんな語らいの後、金平は其の夜童貞でなくなつた。お柳様も勿論女の歓びを知つた。
　その翌る朝であつた。
　金平は御用屋敷の大目付岡田村監に呼び出された。脛に傷もつだけにドキリとしたが、まさかと度胸を据えて出掛けた。
──明寅の下刻お穴門迄来て貰い度い。
　委細承知しました。と平気な顔で戻つてくると何時になく緊張した面持で源内がそつと呼んだ。
──貴公の為を思つて云う。金平今夜のうちに江戸を立退きなさい。
──とは、何故です。
──胸に覚えのある筈──。ではどうしてもお穴門に行く気か？
──既に御承知で？……
──知つているから云うのだ。金平貴公未だ若い。不憫と思うのじや。
──ではお穴門に……
──多分伊賀者が待つておろう。貴公を斬る為だよ。
──では岡田様は私を葬るつもりですか──
──それが目付の仕事なら致し方ない。わしは何時か話をじた事がある。金平そなた何も知らぬと思つていたかも知れんが、初島の御中臈とそなたの事は逐一、大目付の耳に入つている。闇に眼の見えない伊賀者、いつか注意した筈だが、愈々金平そなた明日が最後だ。兎も角逃げなさい。
──初島殿がお気の毒です。
──そ、それを云つてはいけない。度々云つてあるではないか。あの女たちは一生この屋敷で果てる身そうした運命なのじや。
──仕方ありません。もう隠しませんね。私は戒めを破つて、初島のお柳殿と口も聞き、いやそれどころか行末堅く、契りも致しました。今更あの人を捨てゝ逃げたくもありませんぬ。
──ではどうしても行くか──
──行つて見なければ分りませぬ。
　憐む様に源内は口をつぐんで、ホツと深い溜息をもらした。
──そうだ、今宵初島殿を……
　強い決意を眉宇に閃かせた金平は、硯と紙を手許に引寄せて、サラ／＼二三行認めた。折畳んで懐に入れると悠々迫らず、そつと雨戸を開いて表へ出る。いつもの内堀を一気にのり越してトンと屋敷内に下りる。
　金平の行手をはばむものは何もなかつた。
　時刻は既に七ツを廻つていた。寒月に照らされた長局造りのお長屋は死の静けさだつた。数多の女体が転寝、眠れぬ夜長を恨んでいるだろう。余りにも非道い自由の束縛──。
　いつもの雨戸をトン／＼。さつと灯がもれる。逸早く書状を投げ込むと、颯ッと身を引いて待つた。するとお柳の白衣が現われて、暗獣のうちに眼で知らす。命をかけた冒険。
　明朝、暁の頃──。金平が鍵を外しておいた裏門からお柳を逃す手配をすますと、落逢う先を御行の松と定めて、再び金平は戻つた。

　　　五

　初島様の寝床が藁抜けの殻と、大騒ぎの始まつた頃、金平は命じられた寅の下刻、無銘の腰双を合せてお穴門に出掛けていた。
　東の空から赤い太陽が顔を覗かせて、大気は爽々と冷たく、辺り一帯は青桐の林だつた。
　スーツと冷めいた大気を腹一杯吸いこんで、金平はじつと精神を落ちつけた。
　お柳はうまく逃げただろうか。逃げたとなると命が惜しい。スーツと気配を感じて振むくと、いつの間にか覆面の人影が近づいていた。足音一つせず、サッサツと空気を切つて近づいてくる。パツと掌にしめりをくれてギラリと金平は抜いた。相手も無言で抜いて構えた。金平大上段相手は中段。じり／＼と爪立ち歩きに近づく。気合一つかけない相手であるが、その構えから流れる蒼白い殺気の凄じさ。ウムと冷汗がどつと体内に溢れる。自分でも分る位相手の腕は格段の相違だつた。
（やられたか──。うん、やられたかも知れん。もう駄目だ。アア頭がガン／＼してくる。）
　金平は観念して眼を閉じた。静寂を洩れて相手の吐息に似た唸きがスーッと耳に入る。
──不思議だぞ。斬つてこないな……。
　そう思うと頭が急にスーッと快くなり、心は落付いて、恐怖の念が薄紙を剥ぐ様に薄れて行つた。無念無想──。今の金平にはお柳もなく、情命の念もなく、唯暗闇の空間だけが脳裏の奥にチヨツピリ残つているに過ぎなかつた。
　相手の剣が僅かに動揺した。その間一髪、大上段の刃が、ビユーンと風を切つて、紫電の如く落下した。声もたてず唐竹割にされて、ドタリと伊賀者は朽木の様に倒れた。
　夢ではない。──勝つたッ。俺は勝つたぞ。金平はドシンと大きく尻餅をついてへたばると、途端にお柳の事が頭一杯にのきばり返つた。呆然と相手の屍体を眺めていたが、ピョンとはね仕掛の様に飛び上ると、走つた──。
　御行の松の梢が見えて来た。もう一息──。
　お柳──お柳──お柳！　と叫んだ。
　松の大幹にお柳は凭れていた。しかし彼女の息の根は止まつていた。乳房と乳房の真中をグサリと一突き、切先きは松の幹にささり込んで、お柳は無惨にも呪い人形の様に腕をたれたまま、ベタリと松にはりついて死んでいた。タラタラと胸許から走つた血汐が、赤くお柳のしどけなく乱れた裾から見える白脛を染めて、金平は愕然と声も出なかつた。

　金平の行く手を阻むものは何もなかった。
　時刻はすでに七ツを回っていた。寒月に照らされた長局造りの長屋は、死の静けさだった。数多くの女たちがうたた寝し、眠れぬ夜長を恨んでいるだろう。あまりにも非道な自由の束縛──。
　いつもの雨戸をトントン。さっと灯が漏れる。いち早く書状を投げ込むと、さっと身を引いて待った。するとお柳の白い着姿が現れ、暗闇の中で目で合図する。命を懸けた冒険。

　スーッと冷たい大気を腹一杯吸い込んで、金平はじっと精神を落ち着かせた。
　お柳はうまく逃げただろうか。逃げたとなると命が惜しい。スーッと気配を感じて振り向くと、いつの間にか覆面の人影が近づいていた。足音一つせず、サッサッと空気を切って近づいてくる。パッと掌を湿らせて、ギラリと金平は刀を抜いた。相手も無言で抜いて構えた。金平は大上段、相手は中段。じりじりと爪先立ちで近づく。気合一つかけない相手であるが、その構えから流れる青白い殺気の凄まじさ。「うむ」と冷や汗がどっと体内に溢れる。自分でも分かるほど、相手の腕は格段の差があった。
（やられたか。うん、やられたかもしれん。もうだめだ。ああ、頭がガンガンしてくる。）
　金平は覚悟を決めて目を閉じた。静寂を破って相手の吐息に似た呻きがスーッと耳に入る。
（不思議だぞ。斬ってこないな……。）
　そう思うと頭が急にスーッと軽くなり、心は落ち着いて、恐怖心が薄紙を剥ぐように消えていった。無念無想。今の金平にはお柳もなく、生への執着もなく、ただ暗闇の空間だけが脳裏の奥に少し残っているに過ぎなかった。
　相手の剣がわずかに動揺した。その間一髪、大上段の刃が、ビュンと風を切って、紫電のごとく落下した。声も立てずに真っ向から斬り下げられ、ドタリと伊賀者は朽ち木のように倒れた。
　夢ではない。勝った。俺は勝ったぞ。金平はどしんと大きく尻餅をついてへたり込むと、途端にお柳のことが頭いっぱいに蘇った。呆然と相手の死体を眺めていたが、ぴょんとはねるように飛び上がると、走った。
　御行の松の梢が見えてきた。もう一息。
「お柳、お柳、お柳！」と叫んだ。
　松の太い幹にお柳はもたれかかっていた。しかし彼女の息の根は止まっていた。乳房の真ん中をグサリと一突き、切っ先は松の幹にまで突き刺さり、お柳は無残にも呪いの人形のように腕を垂らしたまま、べったりと松に張り付いて死んでいた。たらたらと胸元から流れた血が、お柳の乱れた裾から見える白い足を赤く染めており、金平は愕然として声も出なかった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"—Yes, forever do not abandon me..."
After such talk, Kinpei that night ceased to be a virgin. O-yanagi-sama also naturally knew woman's joy.
It was the following morning.
Kinpei was summoned by the Shogunate estate's Chief Inspector (Ometsuke) Okada Murakanshi. Because he had a "wound on his shin" (guilty conscience), his heart went pit-a-pat, but thinking "it cannot be," he set out with courage.
"—Tomorrow, at the late hour of the Tiger, I want you to come to the Ana-mon Gate."
"Understood in detail," he said, and returning with a calm face, Gennai, with an unusually tense expression, quietly called him.
"—I say this thinking of your sake. Kinpei, within tonight, leave Edo."
"—That, why is it?"
"—You should have a feeling in your chest (know the reason). Then, do you intend to go to the Ana-mon Gate no matter what?"
"—Already, you are aware?..."
"—Because I know, I say it. Kinpei, you are still young. I think it is pitiful."
"—Then, at the Ana-mon Gate..."
"—Probably Iga-monos (Iga ninjas) will be waiting. It is for the purpose of cutting you down."
"—Then, Master Okada intends to bury me—"
"—If that is the Inspector's job, it cannot be helped. I have talked about this once before. Kinpei, you might have thought you knew nothing, but the matter of the Hatsu-shima court lady and you has one by one reached the Chief Inspector's ears. The Iga-monos whose eyes are invisible in the dark—I should have warned you once, but finally Kinpei, for you, tomorrow is the end. At any rate, flee."
"—Hatsu-shima-dono is to be pitied."
"—Tha, that you must not say. Have I not told you many times? Those women are beings who end their lives in this estate; it is such a destiny."
"—It cannot be helped. I will no longer hide it. I broke the restraint, and with Hatsu-shima's O-yanagi-dono I spoke, no, even more than that, we promised the future and made a vow (physical union). At this late stage, I do not want to abandon that person and flee."
"—Then, will you go no matter what—"
"—If I do not go and see, I will not know."
As if pitying him, Gennai closed his mouth and let out a deep sigh.
"—Right, tonight, Hatsu-shima-dono..."
Flashing a strong determination between his eyebrows, Kinpei pulled inkstone and paper to his hand and wrote two or three lines fluently. Folding it and putting it in his breast pocket without hurry, he quietly opened the rain shutters and went outside. He crossed the usual inner moat in one breath and landed "thud" inside the estate.
There was nothing that obstructed Kinpei's way.
The time had already passed "Nanatsu" (4:00 AM). The long-house built in Nagatsubone-style illuminated by the cold moon was a deathly silence. Many female bodies were napping, likely hating the long night where they cannot sleep. Truly cruel restriction of freedom—.
At the usual rain shutter, "tap tap." Light leaks out quickly. Throwing in the letter promptly, he pulled his body back and waited. Then O-yanagi's white garment appeared, and in the dark silence, she signaled with her eyes. An adventure staking one's life.
Tomorrow morning, around dawn—. When Kinpei finished arrangements to let O-yanagi escape from the back gate where he had left the key unlocked, he set the meeting place as the "Ugiyō-no-matsu" (Going Pine), and Kinpei returned again.

V

By the time the great commotion started that Hatsu-shima-sama's bed was an empty shell, Kinpei was at the commanded late hour of the Tiger, having paired his unbranded swords, and was out at the Ana-mon Gate.
The red sun peeked its face from the eastern sky, the air was bracingly cold, and the entire area was a forest of Chinese parasol trees.
Sucking the cold air in deeply, Kinpei steadily calmed his spirit.
Did O-yanagi escape well? If she escaped, his life is precious. Feeling a presence, he turned around, and before he knew it, a masked figure was approaching. Without a single footstep, "swish swish," cutting the air, it approaches. Quickly giving moisture to his palms, Kinpei drew with a flash. The opponent also drew and took a stance without a word. Kinpei high-overhead stance, opponent middle-guard stance. Bit by bit, approaching on tiptoes. Although it is an opponent who does not let out a single spirit-shout, the dreadfulness of the pale killing intent flowing from that stance. "Ugh," cold sweat flooded his body. Even he could tell the opponent's skill was of a different level.
(Was I got? Yes, I might have been got. It's no use now. Ah, my head is throbbing.)
Kinpei resigned himself and closed his eyes. Leaking through the silence, a groan like the opponent's breath entered his ears.
—It's strange. He doesn't strike...
Thinking so, his head suddenly became light, his heart settled, and the feeling of fear thinned away like peeling off thin paper. No-mind, no-thought—. In the current Kinpei, there was no O-yanagi, no thought of life, only a tiny bit of dark space remained in the back of his mind.
The opponent's sword wavered slightly. In that split second, the high-overhead blade, with a "vroom" cutting the wind, fell like purple lightning. Without making a sound, being split like bamboo (karatake-wari), the Iga-mono fell like rotten wood with a "thud."
It's not a dream. —I won! I won! Kinpei sat down heavily on his buttocks and slumped, and immediately the matter of O-yanagi came back fully into his head. He was staring blankly at the opponent's corpse, but jumping up like a spring-trap, he ran—.
The treetop of the Ugiyō-no-matsu came into sight. One more breath—.
"O-yanagi— O-yanagi— O-yanagi!" he shouted.
O-yanagi was leaning against the great trunk of the pine. However, her breath had stopped. A single thrust through the center of her breasts, the tip was pierced into the pine trunk, and O-yanagi, cruelly like a curse doll with arms hanging down, was stuck flat to the pine and dead. The blood that ran "drip-drip" from her chest dyed the white shins visible from her disheveled hem red, and Kinpei was aghast and could not even speak.
(The End)

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"—Yes... please, never abandon me."
After those whispered words, Kinpei lost his innocence that night. O-yanagi, too, finally knew the joys of a woman's heart.
It was the following morning.
Kinpei was summoned by Okada Murakanshi, the Chief Inspector of the Shogunal estate. With a guilty conscience, his heart hammered against his ribs, but he steeled himself and went, telling himself it couldn't possibly be what he feared.
"Come to the Ana-mon Gate tomorrow, during the late hour of the Tiger."
"Understood," Kinpei replied with a mask of composure. But upon his return, he was intercepted by Gennai, whose face was pale with an uncharacteristic tension.
"I tell you this for your own sake, Kinpei. Leave Edo tonight."
"And why should I do that?"
"You know well enough why. Do you truly intend to go to that gate?"
"So... you already know?"
"It is because I know that I speak. You are young, Kinpei. I find it a pity to see you thrown away."
"Then, at the gate..."
"Iga ninjas will be waiting. They are there to kill you."
"So, Master Okada intends to see me buried?"
"If that is his duty as Inspector, he has little choice. I warned you once before. You may have thought your secret safe, but the affair between you and the lady-in-waiting, Hatsu-shima, has reached the Chief Inspector's ears in every detail. I told you the Iga see in the dark. Your time is up, Kinpei. Flee, while you still can."
"But what of Lady Hatsu-shima? It would be cruel to leave her."
"Do not speak of her! Have I not told you? Those women are destined to live and die within these walls. It is their fate."
"I cannot do it. I will hide it no longer. I have broken the laws; I have spoken with O-yanagi, and more—we have pledged our futures and shared our bodies. I cannot abandon her now."
"Then you go to your death?"
"I must see for myself."
Gennai fell silent, looking upon him with pity, and let out a long, heavy sigh.
"Very well... tonight then, the Lady Hatsu-shima..."
With a flash of resolve in his eyes, Kinpei reached for his inkstone and brushed a few hurried lines. He tucked the note into his kimono and, with calm deliberation, slipped out into the night. He vaulted the inner moat and landed softly within the grounds.
No one stood in his way.
It was past four in the morning. The long corridors of the women’s quarters lay in a deathly silence under the cold moonlight. Within, many women likely lay in fitful sleep, resentful of their long, stolen freedom. It was a heartless imprisonment.
Kinpei tapped twice on the familiar shutter. A sliver of light appeared. He tossed the letter inside and vanished into the shadows. O-yanagi appeared briefly in her white robes, her eyes meeting his in a silent, life-risking pact.
Dawn was breaking. Kinpei arranged for O-yanagi to escape through the unlocked back gate, setting their meeting place at the "Ugiyō-no-matsu" pine tree. Then, he turned back to face his fate.

V

By the time the alarm was raised that Lady Hatsu-shima’s chambers were empty, Kinpei was already at the Ana-mon Gate as ordered, his two unbranded swords at his side.
The red sun began to peek over the eastern horizon. The air was crisp and cold in the grove of Chinese parasol trees. Kinpei took a long, cooling breath and centered his spirit.
Had O-yanagi escaped? Now that she might be free, his own life suddenly felt precious. He felt a presence behind him. Turning, he saw a masked figure approaching. The figure moved without a sound, slicing through the air with predatory grace. Kinpei spat on his palms to steady his grip and drew his blade with a metallic ring. The assassin drew as well. Kinpei held his sword high in an overhead guard; the assassin held his at mid-level. They closed the distance on tiptoe. Though the masked man remained silent, the aura of cold, blue killing intent radiating from him was staggering. Cold sweat poured down Kinpei’s back. He knew, with sinking certainty, that his opponent’s skill far surpassed his own.
*I am dead,* he thought. *He has me. My head is spinning...*
Kinpei closed his eyes, resigning himself to the end. Through the silence, a low groan, like a sharp intake of breath, reached his ears.
*Strange... why doesn't he strike?*
At that thought, the fog in his mind cleared. A strange calm washed over him, and his fear fell away like a shed skin. He entered a state of "no-mind." There was no O-yanagi, no desire for life—only a vast, dark void.
The assassin’s blade wavered for a fraction of a second. In that heartbeat, Kinpei’s sword came down like a bolt of purple lightning. Without a sound, he split the Iga ninja from crown to torso. The man fell like a piece of dead wood.
It was no dream. He had won. Kinpei collapsed onto the ground, gasping for air. Immediately, the image of O-yanagi flooded his mind. He stared at the corpse for a moment, then scrambled to his feet and ran.
The crown of the Ugiyō-no-matsu came into view. Just a little further.
"O-yanagi! O-yanagi!" he cried.
He found her leaning against the great trunk of the pine. But her breath was gone. A single, brutal thrust had passed through her chest and into the wood behind her. She hung there like a discarded doll, pinned to the tree. Blood dripped from her wound, staining her white shins a gruesome red beneath her tangled robes. Kinpei stood frozen, the cry dying in his throat.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** The text is presented in a two-column vertical layout (*tate-gaki*), which is standard for Japanese literature and magazines.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho-style typeface. Small *ruby* (furigana) characters are used sparingly to assist with the reading of specific kanji (e.g., "脛" - sune, "不憫" - fubin).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The chapter number "五" (Five) is centered within the column to indicate a narrative break. The text uses em-dashes (──) to denote dialogue, a common convention in modern and mid-century Japanese fiction.
*   **Design Features:** The page number "(88)" is at the bottom center. The phrase "（おわり）" (The End) in parentheses marks the conclusion of the story or installment.
*   **Condition:** The paper shows significant yellowing and some foxing, consistent with inexpensive "pulp" magazines from the 1940s or 50s.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era of Publication:** Based on the orthography (mixture of historical kana and early post-war simplification) and the "ero-guro-nansensu" or "pulp" feel of the tragic romance, this likely dates to the **late 1940s or 1950s**.
*   **Setting:** The Edo Period (1603–1867). Mentions of "Edo," "Iga-mono" (ninjas from Iga), and "Ometsuke" (inspectors) establish the historical genre (*jidai-shōsetsu*).
*   **O-chūro (御中臈):** A high-ranking lady-in-waiting in the *Ooku* (inner palace) or a daimyo's estate. These women were often forbidden from having romantic relationships with men outside the inner circle, hence the "restraint" (戒め) mentioned.
*   **Time System:** "Tora no gekoku" (寅の下刻) refers to the traditional Japanese time system. The Hour of the Tiger is roughly 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM; the "late" part would be closer to 4:30-5:00 AM. "Nanatsu" is roughly 4:00 AM.
*   **Iga-mono:** Ninjas were often employed by the Shogunate as spies and assassins (*Oniwaban*). Their presence indicates the high stakes and political danger.
*   **Ugiyō-no-matsu (御行の松):** A famous historical pine tree in Ueno, Tokyo, often associated with legends and ghost stories, serving here as a dramatic landmark for the tragic finale.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **童貞 (Dōtei):** Male virginity. Its use here reflects the more explicit "pulp fiction" style of the era.
*   **脛に傷もつ (Sune ni kizu motsu):** An idiom meaning "to have a guilty conscience" (literally "to have a wound on one's shin").
*   **不憫 (Fubin):** Pitiful or pathetic.
*   **唐竹割 (Karatake-wari):** A vertical sword strike that splits the opponent down the middle, like a stalk of bamboo.
*   **無念無想 (Munen Musō):** A Zen-like state of "no-thought, no-intent," often used in martial arts literature to describe a warrior reaching peak focus.
*   **しどけなく (Shidokenaku):** Disheveled or slovenly, often used in a slightly erotic or vulnerable context regarding a woman's clothing.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Forbidden Love vs. Social Duty (*Giri/Ninjo*):** The central conflict is Kinpei's love for a woman who is essentially property of the state.
*   **Tragedy and Fatalism:** The story emphasizes that the women in the estate are "destined to end their lives there." The ending reinforces the futility of trying to escape feudal restrictions.
*   **Masculine Prowess:** The duel highlights the trope of the "underdog" winning through a moment of spiritual clarity (*Munen Musō*) against a superior professional (the Iga ninja).
*   **Eroticism and Violence:** The juxtaposition of the couple's first night of intimacy with the graphic description of O-yanagi's death (pinned to a tree through her breasts) is characteristic of the "Pulp" magazines of the era which blended romance, action, and horror.
