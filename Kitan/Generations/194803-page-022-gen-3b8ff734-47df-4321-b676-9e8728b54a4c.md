「喧嘩だッ」
ドヤ／＼と大勢の足音に混つて砂ぼこりが蒙々と立ち上つた。
「やいッ、俺の顔をどうしてくれるんだ」
二十二三の顔色の青い痩せた男をつかまえて、二人の人相の悪い奴が左右からなぐりつけている。
昭和十一年四月、四国の高松で連絡船を待ち合わせしていた酒井十九之助が、「何に、喧嘩だと」ふと顧みて人だかりの方へ歩こうとした時逃げ出した青年を追いかけて来た男にドンとつき當つた。
三十才の若い血が、誤つた英雄気取りでムラ／＼と怒気が発してきた
「おいッやめろ」
思わずこう叫んだ
「やめろとは何だ、俺達は好き好んで喧嘩を賣るのぢやないんだツ、邪魔すると承知しないぞ」
「何んだと、てめえ達は──」
仲裁に入ろうとした彼が、その喧嘩を買って出た恰好で、とび出した機織に左右から追ってくる二人の男を相手にもみ合ううちに彼の右手からドスの白い刃がキラリと光った。
「やられた」
「アッ」
もうおそかつた。二人の男は朱に染つて倒れた。十九之助は返り血を浴びたままその場で逮捕された。
つまらぬキッカケから傷害罪で四年。高松刑務所の苦役に烈されることになつた。彼には獄中での悶々の日が續いた。
彼の行動は全く逆上者、或る種の精神異常者であつた。あらゆるものを呪うた、呪うより外に彼の心にはけ場がなかつた。
看守からは毎日鞭の制裁を受けたが、受ける毎に猛獣の様に猛り狂う彼であつた。怒りに狂つている彼の隣房で──
パチパチと掌をうつ音が不思議に夜のしじまを破つて聞えてきた。
彼は看守の目を盗んで隣室との連絡に成功した。
──母への感謝、神佛への祈り──
これだけの應えを聞いた彼はハッと我に返つた。
母者──おゝ、やさしかつた母、俺にも母があつた。彼はさめざめと泣いた。慈愛と信仰──彼は隣房の囚人中山末吉から侵し難い教訓を受けた。
親様、子様（我が子に感謝するですかと始めは驚いたが）喜心、孝心、金剛心と五本の指を握ることを教えられた。
あらゆる宇宙万象に對して感謝を捧げる、これこそ幾多の困難に打ち勝つ道を開かして呉れた教えであつた。
翌日からガラリと變つた彼の態度には看守も驚いた程であつた。
──模範囚から保釋へ
やっと出獄した彼を待つていたものは何であつたらうか。愛する妻、敬する母でもなかつた。それは應召と言う冷厳な赤紙であつた。
刑務所から今度は戦線へ、あまりにも数奇な運命、一日の休養をとるひまもなく、戦線へと狩りたてられて行つた。
困苦と悲惨、銃剣と弾雨の中に、物狂わしいばかりの恐怖地獄の連続であつた。正義感への矛盾をハッキリと意識しつつも、大きな力に反抗するには彼の力は餘りにも小さかつた。
華南、華中の大陸戦線からテニヤン、セレベス、サイパンと、太平洋南方戦線へかけての特殊な慰問隊員としての彼の姿が、生死の間をさまよつて見受けられたのであつた。
「よく生きていられたものだ」
食べるに食なく餓死してゆく兵士の死水をとり、熱病に呻きながら斃れてゆく遺骸を抱きしめては彼の、心は千々に砕ける程であつたが、その度に五本の指を握りしめて祈つた此んな事なら死んだ方がましだと思った。

**The Virgin Who Sleeps with a Snake**
**= Strange Tales from the Curio Theater =**
**By Eizo Kamiyama**

"It's a fight!"
Mingled with the thumping sounds of many footsteps, clouds of dust rose up thickly.
"Hey, what are you going to do about my face?"
Catching a pale, thin man of twenty-two or three, two evil-looking fellows were striking him from left and right.
In April of Shōwa 11 (1936), in Takamatsu, Shikoku, Tokuzō Sakai, who was waiting for a ferry, happened to look back and think "What, a fight?" and as he tried to walk toward the crowd, he collided "thud" with a man chasing a youth who had run away.
His thirty-year-old young blood, with a mistaken sense of playing the hero, felt anger welling up inside.
"Hey, stop it!"
He shouted this without thinking.
"What do you mean 'stop it'? We aren't picking a fight because we like it! If you interfere, we won't let it slide!"
"What did you say, you bastards—"
He who tried to mediate ended up taking on the fight; while struggling with the two men chasing him from left and right into the opening, from his right hand, the white blade of a short sword (dosu) flashed "glint."
"I've been hit!"
"Ah!"
It was already too late. The two men fell, dyed in vermilion. Tokuzō was arrested on the spot while bathed in sprayed blood.
From a trivial beginning, four years for the crime of bodily harm. He was sentenced to hard labor at Takamatsu Prison. For him, agonizing days in prison continued.
His behavior was entirely that of a person in a frenzy, or a type of mentally deranged person. He cursed everything; other than cursing, there was no outlet for his heart.
From the guards, he received the punishment of the whip every day, but every time he received it, he was like a wild beast raging. In the cell next to him who was mad with rage—
The sound of "clap-clap" striking palms broke the silence of the night strangely and could be heard.
Stealing glances from the guards, he succeeded in making contact with the neighboring room.
—Gratitude to mother, prayer to gods and Buddha—
Hearing only this answer, he suddenly came to his senses.
Mother—oh, the mother who was kind, I too had a mother. He wept inconsolably. Affection and faith—he received an inviolable lesson from the prisoner in the neighboring cell, Suekichi Nakayama.
Parent-spirit, Child-spirit (he was surprised at first, asking "Am I to be grateful to my own child?"), Joyful-heart, Filial-heart, Diamond-heart; he was taught to clasp his five fingers.
Offering gratitude to all the myriad things in the universe; this was the teaching that opened the path to overcoming many difficulties.
His attitude, which changed completely from the next day, was such that even the guards were surprised.
—From model prisoner to parole.
When he finally left prison, what was waiting for him? It was not his beloved wife, nor his respected mother. It was the grim "red paper" (draft notice) called conscription.
From prison this time to the battlefront, a truly checkered fate; without a single day's rest, he was driven away to the front.
Amidst hardship and misery, bayonets and a rain of bullets, it was a succession of madness-inducing hellish terrors. While clearly conscious of the contradiction to his sense of justice, his power was far too small to resist the great force.
From South China and Central China continental fronts to Tinian, Celebes, and Saipan, his figure as a "special comfort personnel" across the Pacific Southern front was seen wandering between life and death.
"How could I have stayed alive?"
Taking the last water for starving soldiers who had no food to eat, and embracing the corpses of those falling while moaning with fever, his heart was broken into a thousand pieces, but each time he gripped his five fingers and prayed. He thought it would be better to die than this.

**The Virgin Who Sleeps with a Snake**
**= Strange Tales from the Curio Theater =**
**By Eizo Kamiyama**

"Fight!" someone screamed. Through the heavy thrum of racing footsteps, a thick shroud of dust billowed into the air. 
"Hey! Look what you did to my face!" 
Two thugs were flanking a gaunt, pale young man in his early twenties, raining blows upon him. 
It was April 1936. Tokuzō Sakai was waiting for a ferry in Takamatsu, Shikoku, when the commotion caught his eye. Just as he turned toward the crowd, he collided head-on with a man pursuing a fleeing youth. At thirty years old, Tokuzō’s hot blood boiled over; driven by a misplaced sense of heroism, he snapped.
"Hey! Knock it off!" he roared.
"The hell you say! We aren't doing this for fun! Stay out of it if you know what's good for you!"
"What was that, you bastards—"
Tokuzō stepped in to mediate, but the situation spiraled. As he grappled with the two men, a short blade—a *dosu*—flashed in his right hand. 
"I'm hit!" 
"Agh!" 
It was over in an instant. The two men collapsed, drenched in crimson. Still splattered with their blood, Tokuzō was arrested where he stood.

For that one trivial spark, he was sentenced to four years of hard labor in Takamatsu Prison. His days behind bars were a blur of suppressed rage. He acted like a man possessed, a soul driven to the brink of insanity. He cursed the world; he had no other way to vent the poison in his heart. The guards whipped him daily, but with every lash, he only grew more ferocious, like a caged beast. Yet, next to his cell, where he simmered in madness...
The rhythmic *clap-clap* of hands in prayer began to pierce the dead silence of the night. 

Evading the guards' watchful eyes, Tokuzō managed to speak with the man in the next cell.
"Gratitude to your mother. Prayers to the gods."
These simple words struck Tokuzō like a physical blow, bringing him back to himself. 
*Mother... oh, my kind mother. I had a mother once, too.* He wept bitterly. In that dark cell, he received an indelible lesson in mercy and faith from his neighbor, a man named Suekichi Nakayama. Nakayama taught him the "Five Fingers" of prayer: gratitude for parents, for children, a joyful heart, a filial heart, and a heart as unyielding as a diamond. He learned to offer thanks to every element of the universe. This was the teaching that allowed him to overcome his many trials. 

The change in Tokuzō the following day was so radical it stunned the guards. He became a model prisoner and was eventually granted parole. But what awaited him upon his release? It was neither his beloved wife nor his mother. It was the "red paper"—the cold, grim summons of the draft. 
From the prison cell straight to the front lines—a cruel, twisted fate. Without so much as a day’s rest, he was herded toward the war. 
It was a hell of misery and bayonets, a relentless rain of lead and madness. He felt the crushing weight of the injustice of it all, but he was far too small to resist the gears of the Great Power. From the battlefields of China to the islands of Tinian, Celebes, and Saipan, Tokuzō wandered the edge of life and death as a member of a "special comfort corps."
"How am I still alive?" he wondered.
He gave the last drops of water to soldiers starving to death; he cradled the bodies of those who succumbed to tropical fevers. His heart broke a thousand times over, but each time, he would clasp his five fingers and pray, even when he wished for the sweet release of death.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography:** The text is formatted in traditional vertical columns (*tategaki*), typical of mid-20th-century Japanese periodicals.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is framed by a decorative graphic of a snake, which serves as a visual hook for the "sensationalist" nature of the magazine (*Kitan/Ryōki* style). The author's name and the series title are centrally located at the top.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface used in letterpress printing. Notable is the use of katakana for emphasis and sound effects (e.g., ドヤ／＼, ドンと, キラリ), which was common in pulp fiction to create a visceral, fast-paced feel.
*   **Page Structure:** The page is densely packed with text, using small font sizes to maximize content. The bottom margin contains a page number (22) and decorative line breaks.
*   **Illustrations:** Aside from the header snake, the text is unembellished, suggesting this is a narrative-heavy section of the magazine.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-war "Kasutori" Magazines):** The style suggests the late 1940s to early 1950s. During this time, "Kasutori" magazines (named after a cheap, dreg-based shochu) flourished. They were known for mixing eroticism, the macabre (*ryōki*), and grim accounts of the war.
*   **The "Red Paper" (Akagami):** The conscription notice (*shōshū akagami*) was a dreaded symbol of the Imperial Japanese Army's reach. The narrative arc of going directly from prison to the front lines was a common trope highlighting the "checkered fate" (*suuki na unmei*) of the era's men.
*   **Prison Life (Takamatsu Prison):** Mentioning a specific location like Takamatsu adds a layer of "true story" realism (common in *jitsuwa* or true-tale magazines). The "clapping of hands" (*kashiwade*) in prison refers to Shinto or Buddhist prayer practices.
*   **Special Comfort Personnel (Tokushu na Imon-taiin):** This term is significant. While "Comfort Women" (*ianfu*) is a well-known term, "Imon-tai" (Comfort Corps) also included entertainers, religious figures, and laborers sent to boost morale or provide services to the troops. Being a "special" member often implied a harrowing, non-combatant role that witnessed the worst of the front lines.
*   **Geographic References:** The mention of South China, Tinian, and Saipan places the character in the most brutal theaters of the Pacific War, known for "Gyokusai" (honorable suicide/annihilation) and extreme starvation.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **猟奇 (Ryōki):** Seeking the bizarre, grotesque, or sensational. This was a hugely popular genre label in the early-to-mid 20th century.
*   **ドス (Dosu):** A slang term for a short, single-edged sword or dagger often associated with yakuza or street brawlers.
*   **返り血 (Kaerichi):** Blood spray; specifically the blood of a victim that splashes back onto the attacker.
*   **赤紙 (Akagami):** Literally "Red Paper." The nickname for the military draft notice.
*   **金剛心 (Kongō-shin):** "Vajra-heart" or "Diamond-heart." A Buddhist term for a mind that is firm, unchanging, and indestructible in its faith or resolve.
*   **しじま (Shijima):** An archaic or literary word for silence (*静寂*).
*   **さめざめと (Samezame-to):** To weep inconsolably or shed tears continuously in a quiet, sorrowful manner.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Redemption through Suffering:** The story follows a classic "prodigal son" or "criminal reformed" arc. The protagonist’s violent nature is "cured" not by the prison’s brutality (the whip), but by spiritual connection and the memory of motherly love.
*   **The Cruelty of Fate:** The irony that just as Tokuzō finds inner peace and is released from prison, he is "captured" again by the state to fight in a hopeless war. This reflects a common post-war sentiment: the individual is a leaf blown by the winds of powerful, uncaring institutions.
*   **Contrast of Domesticity and War:** The mention of the "wife and mother" he couldn't see contrasts sharply with the "starving soldiers" and "bodies" he eventually has to hold.
*   **Spiritual Resistance:** The "Five Fingers" prayer acts as a psychological anchor. In the face of overwhelming external horror (war), internal ritual provides the only means of survival.
*   **Sensationalism vs. Morality:** Despite the lurid title ("The Virgin Who Sleeps with a Snake"), the actual content on this page is a moralistic tale of suffering and endurance. This was a common tactic in pulp magazines: use a "dirty" title to sell a story that often ends in a heavy-handed moral or tragic lesson.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction / Short Story (likely based on "true events" or *jitsuwa* style)
*   **Genre:** Ryōki (Sensational/Bizarre), Post-war Pulp, War Memoir (Reflective)
*   **Themes:** Prison Reformation, Buddhism/Spirituality, World War II, Starvation, Motherhood, Fate, Violence.
*   **Flags:** Contains descriptions of violence, war-time suffering, and death.
