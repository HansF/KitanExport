### Column 1 (右)
「下絵を書き終えるのに時間がかかるのでね。」
櫻井はそう言って、精巧なカメラで何枚も写真を撮り、極端にカメラを接近させて局部的な大写しを撮ったりしていたが、やがてまるで年の割に良い腰あたりを指でぐいぐいこねくり、瞼にまで指を押しつけていたりするので、格子は内心段々不快感を感じてきた。
「今度は格子の下着の図を取るのです。よろしいでしょうけれど我慢して下さいよ。」
櫻井はそう言って彼女を後手に縛り、裸肌をめくった赤板の上に、着物がすりすり、彼女の側、赤い布切れが着物の下から腕に回るのにも本当に楽にさせられた所を作り、いかにも本当に楽々と裸身をあらわかせ、櫻井はカメラを岡倉に渡し、ちゃっと岡倉君と微笑んだ。

### Column 2 (中央)
あたし〔…〕唖然だわ!」
桜子はそれで見返しながら傲然とそう言っていた。
「嫌でも応でももう仕方ないでしょう。その後でちゃんとご馳走してあげる。いい娘だから驚くの間の間大人しくしておいで。」
櫻井が淫らな笑みを見せて、本性を露わにしながらそう言っていたので、その心は情欲の虜になったのだろう。ぬるぬると蛇のような調子を伸ばして来た。
そ――の時だ。玄関の戸が激しい音を立てて蹴開された。続いてどやどやと踏み込んだ足音。男達はハッとして飛び上るも、突差の行動は惑い、抵抗するともつかない狼狽を示していた。
しかしもうその次の瞬間に、武装警官が四人の男を取り囲んでしまっていた。
「櫻井貞之助、年貢の納め時だ!」
そう叫んだのは一隊を指揮して来た鴨川探偵である。そしてもう何も躊躇も叫喚もなく、四人はすぐ縛りにつけて警察へ引かれていった。
逃げる事も隠れる事も出来なかった。そこに鴨川君の姿を見出すと、それこそ今までにない程真赤になって身体を縮め、うなだれてしまうのだった。
「馬鹿だなア君は、さっき注意してやったのに、まだこんな所にうろ

### Column 3 (左)
渡して、ニヤッと岡倉君と微笑んだ。
「ちゃつ君、君、これから隠し撮りを続行する。最も精彩を掴み出してやる。五六枚いろいろの角度から撮ってくれ給え。」
そう言って彼は本当に悦びに乗り、その言うままに、後に縛られたという様になっている彼女が躊躇うような、強い声を出すも、食い止めるも、粘着だという事を深く悦び接吻を単独で求めて来た。それから、真正面になって、どんどん粘着を加えた。
その稲田君はもとより、さっき注意してやったのに、まだこんな所にうろ

## Literal English Translation

### Right Column
"It takes time when drawing the sketch (or draft), you see."
Sakurai said this, taking many photographs with a sophisticated camera, sometimes bringing the camera extremely close to take extreme close-ups of specific parts. Then, he started poking and kneading the woman's surprisingly good waist area vigorously with his finger, considering her age, and even pressing his finger against her eyelids. Kōshi gradually began to feel internal discomfort.
"Next, I will take pictures of Kōshi's underwear diagram (pattern). It will be alright, but please bear with it."
Sakurai said this and bound her hands behind her back. He peeled back her bare skin onto a red board, where her clothing rubbed, and on her side, a red cloth went under her clothing and around her arm, creating a setting where she was truly easily manipulated, and where he could truly and easily expose her nude body. Sakurai handed the camera to Okakura, and he quickly smiled at Okakura-kun.

### Center Column
"I [am]... dumbfounded!"
Sakurako said this defiantly while looking back at him.
"Whether you like it or not, it can't be helped now. Afterwards, I'll treat you properly. You're a good girl, so just be docile for a short while while you're shocked."
Sakurai showed an obscene smile (or expression) and spoke, revealing his true nature, suggesting his heart had been captured by lust. He came closer, slithering like a snake.
Just—at that moment.
The entrance door was violently kicked open with a loud noise. Following that were stomping footsteps, crushingly loud. The men sprang up startled, showing confusion and panic that offered no resistance to the sudden turn of events.
However, in the very next instant, armed police officers had surrounded the four men.
"Sadanosuke Sakurai, time to collect your annual tribute/arrears!"
The one who shouted this was Detective Kamogawa, who had led the squad. And then, without any hesitation or outcry, the four men were immediately tied up and hauled away to the police station.
They could neither escape nor hide. When [he] found Kamogawa-kun's figure there, [he] turned completely crimson, shrinking his body and drooping his head, unlike ever before.
"You're an idiot, aren't you? I warned you just now, yet you're still loitering around in such a place..."

### Left Column
Handed [the camera], and smiled wryly at Okakura-kun.
"Chautsu-kun, continue taking hidden shots now. We need to capture the most compelling essence. Take about five or six photos from various angles."
Saying this, he was truly overcome with delight. Just as he said, he found deep pleasure in the fact that the woman, who was now bound behind her back, uttered strong, hesitant cries, trying to stop him, but her resistance was tenacious (sticky). He demanded a kiss exclusively. After that, he faced her head-on and increasingly applied his tenacious (sticky) pressure.
As for Inada-kun, despite having been warned just now, he was still loitering around in such a place...

## Literary English Translation

### Narrative Section
“It takes time to finish the preliminary sketches, you see.”
Sakurai said this. He used a precise, high-end camera to take many photographs, sometimes getting extremely close to capture detailed close-ups of specific body parts. Then, despite her age, he began vigorously kneading her surprisingly firm waist with his fingers, and even pressed his finger directly onto her eyelids. Kōshi felt a rising tide of profound discomfort within her.
“Now, I need to capture the drawing of Kōshi’s underwear pattern. Please endure it; everything will be fine.”

Saying this, Sakurai bound her hands behind her back. He peeled back her bare skin onto a red board, arranging the rubbing of her clothing and a red cloth beneath her garments and around her arm, meticulously creating a setting where she was utterly defenseless, allowing him to expose her nude body easily and completely. Sakurai then passed the camera to Okakura, flashing a quick, knowing smile at him.

**[Sakurai's Instructions / Escalation]**
“Chautsu-kun, continue with the candid shots. We must capture the most stirring expressions. Take five or six pictures from several different angles.”
Overcome by sheer pleasure, he delighted in his own commands. He found deep satisfaction in the fact that the woman, now tied up behind her back, made strong, hesitant noises in protest, yet her opposition only felt tenacious and sticky to him. He then aggressively demanded a kiss for himself alone. Facing her squarely, he escalated his relentless and demanding pressure.

**[Sakurako's Defiance / Interruption]**
“I... I’m completely stunned!”
Sakurako retorted, looking him in the eyes with defiance.
“Whether you agree or object, it’s inevitable now. Afterwards, I will certainly give you a proper treat. Be a good girl, stay quiet just for the little while you’re recovering from the shock.”
Sakurai spoke with a lewd smirk, revealing his true nature, a man utterly enslaved by lust. His manner became slithering and serpentine.

That—was the moment.
The entrance door was violently kicked open with a tremendous crash. Loud, heavy footsteps followed, barging into the room. The men jumped up, startled, displaying an utterly confused panic that offered no effective resistance to the sudden intrusion.
In the very next instant, however, armed police officers had surrounded all four men.
“Sadanosuke Sakurai! It’s time to settle your old debts!”
The man who shouted this was Detective Kamogawa, leader of the squad. Without hesitation or a single cry of protest, the four men were immediately tied up and dragged away to the police station.
Escape and evasion were impossible. When [Sakurai] caught sight of Kamogawa, he turned a shocking crimson—a humiliation he had never known before—and shrank his body, bowing his head in total defeat.
“You truly are a fool, aren’t you? I warned you just a moment ago, yet you’re still idling around in a place like this...”

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Theme | Annotation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Artist as Predator** | Sakurai’s use of terms like "sketch" (*shita-e*) and "diagrams" (*zu*) to justify extreme sexual violation reflects a common critique and fantasy in early 20th-century Japanese media regarding the moral decay and predatory nature attributed to bohemian artists. |
| **Binding and Fetish Objects** | The "red board" (*aka-ita*) and red cloth serve as visual props, enhancing the fetishistic and often painful aspects of the binding, a precursor to modern *kinbaku* (Japanese rope bondage) themes often explored in these magazines. |
| **"Nengu no Osame-doki" (年貢の納め時)** | This powerful phrase suggests that Sakurai’s criminal behavior was not merely a random occurrence but part of a known pattern, possibly involving bribery or debt to Kamogawa. It implies a corrupt or semi-official system of policing vice. |
| **The Fate of Inada-kun** | The concluding, fragmented line about Inada-kun being warned yet still "loitering" suggests that the narrator (or perhaps Kamogawa) knew the raid was coming, implying Inada was perhaps a minor, naïve character who should have known better than to associate with Sakurai. |
| **Body Language of Shame** | Sakurai’s reaction—turning "a shocking crimson" (*makka ni natte*) and "shrinking his body"—is a classically Japanese description of overwhelming, existential shame (*haji*), reflecting the severe social penalty of being caught, especially when tied to the metaphor of "paying tribute." |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Kanji/Kana) | Transcription (Rōmaji) | Meaning / Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **局部的な大寫し** | *kyokubu-teki na ōgashi* | Extreme close-up of specific body parts (euphemism for pornographic focus). |
| **裸身をあばかせ** | *rashin o abakase* | To easily expose the nude body. *Abakasu* is a forceful, revealing verb. |
| **ちやう君** | *chautsu-kun* | Highly informal/slang nickname for Okakura. |
| **粘強** | *nekkyō* | Tenacious, adhesive, sticky. Used here to describe aggressive sexual pressure or the desirable quality of the victim's unrelenting but futile resistance. |
| **倣然** | *bōzen* | Defiantly, haughtily, arrogantly (in this context, defiant pride despite fear). |
| **情慾の虜** | *jōyoku no toriko* | Captive/prisoner of lust. |
| **うろ** | *uro* | Loitering, milling about (fragmented ending). |

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Sadistic Ritual:** The binding and staging (red board, red cloth, specific camera angles) turns the encounter into a performance, necessary for Sakurai's gratification.
*   **The Power of the Gaze:** The act of handing the camera to the accomplice (Okakura) emphasizes the documentation and voyeuristic aspect—the crime is designed not just to be performed, but to be witnessed and captured.
*   **Failed Modernism:** Sakurai, using "sophisticated" technology and an "art" pretext, represents a modern intellectual whose pursuits have devolved into depraved sexual coercion, a critique often found in Shōwa pulp literature.
*   **The Price of Transgression:** The interruption by the detective serves as the required moral hammer, ensuring that the characters indulging in "lust" (*jōyoku*) are swiftly and publicly punished, upholding the era's narrative standard (even in ero-guro).
