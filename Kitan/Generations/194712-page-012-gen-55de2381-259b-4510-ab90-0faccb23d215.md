奇譚俱楽部御中

私は今、世にも恐ろしき告白を致します。
私の夫は去年の秋より、私を毎夜、室の奥なる柱に縛り付ける事を樂しみとして居ります。夫は、私がいかに泣き叫び、懇願しませうとも、その繩を解かうとは決して致しません。
ある夜、夫は私の股間を嘗め回しつゝ、小さな鋏を取り出し、「これで貴女の祕所を美しくしてやる」と云ひました。私は恐怖の餘り氣を失ひかけましたが、痛みよりはむしろ、その屈辱に耐へ難う御座いました。
斯くして私は、毎夜の儀式に身を委ね、遂には夫の「實驗」の快感に目醒めて仕舞ったのです。

## Literal English Translation

To the Kitan Club,

I now make a confession that is terrifying to the world.
Since last autumn, my husband has taken pleasure in tying me every night to the pillar deep inside the room. No matter how much I weep and scream and plead, he absolutely will not untie that rope.
One night, while licking and circling my groin area, my husband took out small scissors and said, "With these, I will make your secret place beautiful." Due to the excess of terror, I nearly lost consciousness, but more than the pain, it was that humiliation that was unbearable.
Thus, I entrusted my body to the nightly ritual, and finally, I awoke to the pleasure of my husband's "experiment."
Tokyo City, S Ward, K.Y. (32 years old, Housewife)

## Literary English Translation

To the Editors of the Kitan Club,

I now offer a confession that is terrifying beyond measure.
Since last autumn, my husband has made it his nightly pleasure to bind me to the innermost pillar of our room. No matter how I weep, scream, or implore him, he will never, ever loosen the ropes.
One evening, while running his tongue around my groin, he produced a small pair of scissors and declared: "With these, I shall make your secret place beautiful." The sheer terror of the moment nearly made me faint, but what was truly unbearable was the humiliation, more so than the actual pain.
In this manner, I surrendered my body to the nightly ritual, and ultimately, I awakened to the strange pleasure inherent in my husband's "experiment."
K.Y., 32, Housewife, S Ward, Tokyo City

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Letter / Confession (読者投稿). This genre was a core element of *Kitan Club*'s sensational content, offering first-person narratives of extreme domestic or sexual deviance presented as genuine testimony.
*   **Author Attribution:** Pseudonym (K.Y.) and specific, yet anonymous, demographic (32-year-old Housewife from Tokyo). This combination enhances perceived authenticity while protecting identity.
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** Pure narrator voice (first-person confession addressed to the magazine).
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in domestic sadomasochism, bondage (shibari), power dynamics within marriage, and the psychological journey from initial shame/fear to acquired pleasure/submission. The narrative appeals to a voyeuristic interest in hidden domestic extremes.
*   **Positioning within the Magazine:** Highly likely featured in a regular column dedicated to "Marital Oddities" or similar confessional sections (e.g., *Sukebe Tsume-awase* / すけべ詰合せ).

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Showa-Era Domestic Taboo:** The text exploits the juxtaposition of the highly controlled, private domestic space (the home, the pillar) and extreme sexual activity (BDSM, potential body modification). The husband’s power over the wife reflects traditional patriarchal authority, twisted into a personalized sexual fetish.
*   **The Pillar (柱):** Binding the victim to the central house pillar is a recurring, potent image in Japanese literary bondage and horror, symbolizing inescapable control within the very foundation of the family structure.
*   **Ero-Guro Tropes:** The narrative includes classic Ero-Guro elements: the use of everyday objects for terror (small scissors), the focus on psychological breakdown (humiliation over pain), and the final transformation of the victim into a willing participant ("awakened to the pleasure").
*   **"Experiment" (實驗 / Jikken):** This term is a specific intellectualized euphemism in postwar Japanese literature, particularly concerning sexual deviance. It attempts to frame abusive or fetishistic behavior as objective, modernist research into psychology or eroticism, lending the act an air of sophistication and seriousness for the sophisticated urban reader.
*   **"Secret Place" (祕所 / Hisho) and Scissors:** The phrase "make your secret place beautiful" strongly implies an act of genital grooming or symbolic/actual mutilation (e.g., shaving pubic hair, trimming, or piercing), focusing on the vulnerability inherent in manipulating an extremely intimate area.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **奇譚俱楽部御中 (Kitan Kurabu Onchū):** Standard formal address for a letter or document to an organization.
*   **樂しみとして居ります (Tanoshimi to shite orimasu):** "Takes pleasure in." Formal, slightly archaic structure used to describe a perverse custom.
*   **繩 (Nawa):** Rope, specific reference to BDSM/kinbaku practice.
*   **嘗め回しつゝ (Name mawashitsutsu):** "While licking and circling." Explicit action describing oral contact with the groin area (股間).
*   **祕所 (Hisho):** Euphemism for female genitals. (Lit. Secret Place).
*   **屈辱 (Kutsujoku):** Humiliation/Mortification. Emphasized as the most significant pain point, central to the S/M psychological dynamic.
*   **儀式 (Gishiki):** Ritual. Used to describe the routine, sexual bondage sessions, lending them a formal, quasi-religious significance.
*   **實驗 (Jikken):** Experiment. Key euphemism for extreme or abusive sexual fetishism/S&M practices.
*   **目醒めて仕舞った (Mezamete shimatta):** "Found myself awakened." The final, often crucial S/M narrative development where the subject internalizes the abuse/coercion and finds pleasure in submission.

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Sadomasochistic Transformation:** The core theme is the journey from resistance (crying, pleading) to total surrender and the realization of pleasure (*jouissance*) within a coercive S/M dynamic. This justifies the extreme behavior within the narrative structure desired by the genre.
*   **The Domination of the Modern Wife:** The housewife (主婦 / shufu) is shown as simultaneously the center of the household (symbolized by the pillar) and utterly subordinate to her husband's desires, reflecting anxieties about shifting gender roles in postwar society.
*   **Aestheticized Violation:** The husband's stated intention ("make beautiful") suggests a perverse aesthetic motive for the sexual violence/modification, aligning the text with the Ero-Guro tendency to find beauty in the morbid, painful, or transgressive.
*   **Clinical Voyeurism:** By presenting the story as a clinical "confession" about an "experiment," the text invites the reader to observe extreme taboo acts under the guise of psychological or social documentation.
