　旅館の奥まった離れ座敷には、ちゃんと酒や料理の準備が出来ていました。
「懍（おそ）ろしい人ね！　待ちくたびれて、あたしもう……」
　裾を乱して、よろよろと立ち上り、私の胸へ抱きついてきた早百合の口からは、むうつと酒の香がしました。これが初対面の男と女の礼儀でしょうか。私は静かに、しかし力強く、早百合の重い身体を胸から押しのけました。すると、彼女はかえつて
「あら、あんた、じゃけんな人ねえ、うふふ」
と生あたゝかい両腕で私の首へしがみついてきて、いきなり私の唇へ火のような唇を押しつけてきました。
　六甲山中の有馬の秋の夜です、もう肌寒いほどの青白い月光が座敷いっぱいに漂うていました。
　それが私と早百合の肌をふれあった最初の夜となりました。彼女があえぎあえぎ
「あたしは処女じゃないのよ」
と熱っぽくさゝやくまでもなく、私はパンパンよりもえげつない手管で、早百合が今まで何十人という男の血を吸った妖婦であることを直感しました。弾力のない肌のくせに、男の生血の最後の一滴まで吸いつくさずにおかないそんな女の技巧にかゝっては、男はなんという情ない動物でしょう。
　ぐっすり寝こんだ夜明け、ふと眼をさまして便所へ行こうとした私は、ふと隣りにねている女の素顔を見て、ぞうつと背中に玉のような冷汗が浮かびました。
　剥げた白粉や眉墨や口紅の下から露出した清水早百合の素顔は、どんよりと暗い鉛色の皮膚、そして眼尻鼻のわき、口元、首筋には、一面にふとい皺や小皺が寄って居り、すこしあけた口からは、老人臭い黄色い乱杭歯がのぞいていました。
　これが万年娘役の名女優の正体なのか、幻滅の肉体の悲しみがじいんと私の胸に沁み通りました。
　早百合からはその後気が狂ったように、ひんぴんと私へのラブレターが届きました。逢うのがいやさに逃げまわるほど、女はうるさく私につきまといました。大阪のアルプス球団の合宿所はもとより、私が東京の後楽園球場に出れば東京へ、四国へ行けば四国へ、九州へ行けば九州へ、まるで公然の恋人のように女は影のように現われ、私をつかまえるのでした。
　喜んだのは新聞社や雑誌社の記者でした。プロ野球の人気投手と、映画女優の火のような恋…彼らにとってこんな絶好のニュースが他にありましょうか。私と早百合のスキャンダルは尾鰭をつけてファンの間に拡がって行きました。
　だが、妖婦の捕虜になった私は同時にプロ野球選手としてのいたいせつな肉体を急速に蝕ばまれて行きました。あくことを知らぬ女との交渉で、私の衰弱は人眼にも哀れに見える位になりました。
　極度の貧血に加えての練習不足は、チームの生命である投手の投球力を根こそぎ奪って行きました。
「おい、どうしたんだ、直球もカーブも全然だめじゃないか、一体君は遊び半分で投手の大役がつとまると思うのか！」
　ハッピー球団のような強打者ぞろいのチームにすら、私のボールはぽかゝんとつぎざまに打たれ、無惨にも十六対ゼロという成績で敗北した夜、私は監督のＳ氏に烈火のように叱られました。
「よせっ！、君などに投手を任されるか、明日からは外野にまわれ…」
「はい、すみません」
　それが私の頽落のスタートでした。その外野でさえも、肉体の疲労しきった私には勤まりませんでした。外野にまわされて数日後、セントパール球団との試合で、打ち上げられた外野よりの高いボールを受けとめるべく、必死に走った私は、俄かにぐらぐらと激しいめまいを感じ、どんと外野のコンクリート塀に頭をぶつけるとともに、泡を吹いて昏倒してしまったのです。数万のファンの渦が大鉄傘下に総立ちになってわあつと人さわぎをしている声が気絶する前にぼんやりと聞こえましたが……。
　私が監督Ｓ氏の厚い情で、誰にも真相の洩れないよう「病気による退団」という口実でアルプス球団から影を消したのは、その翌日だったのです。
　あゝ、だが清水早百合は私を不幸のどん底に陥し入れ、球団を追放されたことがわかると、ぴたりと連絡を絶ち……

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(5)
In the inner separate guest room of the inn, alcohol and food preparations were properly completed.
"Terrifying person, aren't you! Tired of waiting, I already..."
Disarranging her hem, staggering and standing up, clinging to my chest came Sayuri, from whose mouth a thick smell of alcohol did. Is this the etiquette of a first-meeting man and woman? I quietly, but strongly, pushed away Sayuri’s heavy body from my chest. Then, she conversely,
"Oh, you, heartless person, aren't you, tee-hee,"
clinging to my neck with lukewarm both arms, suddenly pressed fire-like lips to my lips.
It is an autumn night in Arima, within the Rokko Mountains; already chilly-degree pale moonlight was floating fully in the guest room.
That became the first night I and Sayuri touched skin. She, gasping-gasping,
"I am not a virgin, you know,"
even without feverishly whispering so, I, with more nasty techniques than a *Pan-pan*, instinctively felt Sayuri was a temptress who had sucked the blood of dozens of men until now. Despite non-elastic skin, by such a woman’s technique that doesn't stop without sucking the last drop of a man’s life-blood, what a miserable animal a man is.
At dawn having slept soundly, suddenly waking up and trying to go to the toilet, I suddenly saw the sleeping woman’s unmade face, and "zotto" (chilled) on my back bead-like cold sweat emerged.
From under the peeled white powder, eyebrow ink, and lipstick, the exposed unmade face of Sayuri Shimizu was dull and dark lead-colored skin, and at the corners of the eyes, side of the nose, mouth area, and neck, thick wrinkles and small wrinkles were gathered all over, and from the slightly opened mouth, old-person-smelling yellow irregular teeth were peeping out.
Was this the true form of the famous actress of perpetual young girl roles? The sadness of the disillusioned flesh pierced deeply into my chest.
From Sayuri after that, like being crazy, frequently love letters to me arrived. To the extent of running around because of hating to meet, the woman annoyingly followed me. Not to mention the Osaka Alps team training camp, if I went to Tokyo’s Korakuen Stadium, to Tokyo; if I went to Shikoku, to Shikoku; if I went to Kyushu, to Kyushu; just like a public lover, the woman appeared like a shadow and caught me.
The ones who rejoiced were the reporters of newspaper and magazine companies. "The fire-like love of a professional baseball popular pitcher and a movie actress"... for them, could there be another such perfect news? The scandal of me and Sayuri spread among fans with added "fins and tails" (exaggerations).
But, having become the temptress's prisoner, I simultaneously had my important body as a pro baseball player rapidly eroded. By dealings with the woman who knew no satisfaction, my weakness became to the degree of looking pitiful even to others' eyes.
Practice deficiency added to extreme anemia took away the pitcher’s throwing power, which is the life of the team, by the roots.
"Hey, what happened? Fastballs and curves are both completely no good, aren't they? Do you think you can serve the big role of pitcher with half-hearted playing around!"
Even against a team full of heavy hitters like the Happy team, my balls were "pokan" (absently) hit one after another, and on the night of a miserable defeat with a score of sixteen to zero, I was scolded by Manager S like a raging fire.
"Stop! Can I entrust the pitcher to the likes of you? From tomorrow, move to the outfield..."
"Yes, I am sorry."
That was the start of my degradation. Even that outfield, for me whose body was completely exhausted, I could not manage. A few days after being moved to the outfield, in a game with the St. Pearl team, in order to catch a high ball further than the outfield, I who ran desperately suddenly felt dizzy and wobbly, and with a "don" (thud) hit my head against the concrete outfield wall, and blowing bubbles, fainted. The whirlpool of tens of thousands of fans standing up under the "Great Iron Umbrella" and making a "waa" (uproar) sound was heard dimly before losing consciousness, but...
It was the next day that I, by Manager S's deep compassion, so the truth would not leak to anyone, under the pretext of "withdrawal due to illness," vanished from the Alps team.
Ah, but Sayuri Shimizu, having plunged me into the bottom of unhappiness, once she knew I was expelled from the team, abruptly cut off contact...

**Part 5**

Inside the secluded annex of the inn, the sake and food had been meticulously prepared. 

"You're a terrifying man! Making me wait so long, I'm just..." 

Sayuri stood up unsteadily, her kimono hem in disarray, and clung to my chest. Her breath reeked of alcohol. I wondered if this was the proper way for a man and woman to behave upon their first meeting. Quietly but firmly, I pushed her heavy body away. Instead of taking offense, she chuckled. 

"Oh, you're a cold one, aren't you? Tee-hee." 

She wrapped her lukewarm arms around my neck and suddenly pressed her lips—burning like fire—against mine. We were in Arima, deep in the Rokko Mountains, on an autumn night. Pale, chilly moonlight flooded the room. That was the first night our skin touched. Gasping for breath, she whispered, "I'm not a virgin, you know." 

She didn't even need to say it. Her techniques were more vulgar than those of a common streetwalker; I instinctively felt she was a "vamp" who had sucked the life out of dozens of men. Despite her skin lacking elasticity, she possessed a skill that wouldn't stop until she had drained the last drop of a man's lifeblood. To such a woman, what a pathetic creature a man is.

At dawn, I woke from a heavy sleep to use the restroom. I glanced at the woman sleeping beside me, and a bead of cold sweat broke out across my back. Stripped of her powder, eyebrow pencil, and lipstick, the raw face of the famous actress Sayuri Shimizu was revealed: her skin was a dull, leaden gray, and her eyes, nose, mouth, and neck were a mass of deep furrows and fine wrinkles. Through her slightly parted lips, I could see yellow, crooked teeth that smelled of old age. Was this the reality of the "eternal ingénue"? A sharp pang of disillusionment pierced my heart.

After that night, Sayuri hounded me with a maddening frequency of love letters. She clung to me so relentlessly that I spent my days trying to hide. Whether I was at the Alps team’s camp in Osaka, or playing at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, or traveling to Shikoku or Kyushu, she appeared like a shadow, acting as if we were public lovers.

The press was delighted. "The Fiery Romance of a Star Pitcher and a Screen Goddess"—what better headline could they ask for? The scandal grew, embellished with wild rumors, spreading like wildfire among the fans. But as the temptress’s captive, my physical health—the lifeblood of a professional athlete—began to wither. Exhausted by the demands of a woman who knew no satisfaction, I grew so gaunt that people looked at me with pity.

My lack of practice, compounded by extreme anemia, stripped me of my pitching power. 

"Hey! What's wrong with you?" my manager barked. "Your fastballs and curves are useless. Do you think being a star pitcher is some kind of joke?" 

Even against a team like the "Happy" club, my pitches were knocked out of the park one after another. After a humiliating sixteen-to-zero defeat, Manager S laid into me with a fiery rage. 

"That's enough! I can't trust you on the mound anymore. Tomorrow, you're moving to the outfield."

"Yes, sir. I'm sorry."

That was the beginning of my downfall. But even in the outfield, my exhausted body failed me. A few days later, during a game against the St. Pearl team, I raced to catch a high fly ball. Suddenly, the world began to spin. I slammed headfirst into the concrete outfield wall and collapsed, foaming at the mouth. Before I lost consciousness, I could dimly hear the roar of tens of thousands of fans rising from their seats under the stadium roof...

The next day, out of the goodness of his heart, Manager S allowed me to disappear from the Alps team under the guise of "retiring due to illness" so the truth would remain hidden. But alas, as soon as Sayuri Shimizu realized she had dragged me to the bottom of despair and cost me my career, she cut off all contact entirely...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows a standard right-to-left, vertical-column structure typical of Japanese periodicals. 
*   **Typography:** The body text is a standard serif typeface (Mincho style). The title "5" is enclosed in brackets, indicating it is a serialized chapter.
*   **Illustration:** A central ink drawing depicts the "妖婦" (vamp/temptress) figure—an older, heavily made-up woman—clinging to a younger, distressed-looking man. This visual style is characteristic of post-war *kasutori* (pulp) magazines, which prioritized sensationalism and "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) aesthetics.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text is dense, with little white space, suggesting a low-budget publication intended for quick consumption. The illustration serves as the primary hook to draw the reader into the scandalous narrative.
*   **Structure:** The narrative uses first-person "confession" style, a popular trope in post-war literature where characters recount their moral failings or sexual escapades.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasu-tori Magazines:** The text likely comes from a *kasutori* magazine. These were cheap, low-quality magazines that flourished during the Allied Occupation (1945–1952). The name comes from *kasutori* shochu, a low-grade alcohol; it was said these magazines lasted only "three issues" (just as one might pass out after three shots of the drink).
*   **Pan-pan (パンパン):** A specific slang term used in the text to describe street prostitutes who catered to the Occupation forces. Comparing the famous actress to a *Pan-pan* was a way to emphasize her vulgarity and lack of class.
*   **Baseball Popularity:** Post-war Japan saw a massive resurgence in the popularity of professional baseball. The mention of "Korakuen Stadium" and the "Great Iron Umbrella" (大鉄傘 - *Daitessan*, a nickname for the roof over stadiums like Koshien) grounds the story in the reality of the era.
*   **Arima Onsen:** Mentioning Arima (a famous hot spring near Kobe) adds a layer of "leisure and luxury" to the scandalous setting.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The "femme fatale" or "vampire" trope was common in this era, reflecting social anxieties about changing women's roles and the "corrupting" influence of modern/Westernized lifestyles on Japanese men.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **懍ろしい (Osoroshii):** An archaic or stylized kanji usage for "fearful" or "terrible."
*   **妖婦 (Yōfu):** Temptress, vamp, or femme fatale. Literally "enchantress-woman."
*   **頽落 (Tairaku):** Degeneration, corruption, or a fall from grace.
*   **乱杭歯 (Ranguiba):** Irregular or crooked teeth. In this context, used to emphasize the "ugliness" and aging of the actress when her makeup is off.
*   **尾鰭をつけて (Ohire wo tsukete):** An idiom meaning "to embellish a story" (literally, "to add fins and tails").
*   **大鉄傘 (Daitessan):** "Great Iron Umbrella." Historically refers to the large steel roof over the stands of Koshien Stadium (though used here generically for a stadium), which was famously stripped for scrap metal during the war and rebuilt later.
*   **どんより (Donyori):** Dull, leaden, or overcast. Used here to describe the grayish, unhealthy skin of the actress.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Disillusionment:** A central theme is the gap between "public image" (the beautiful "eternal ingénue") and "private reality" (the aging, toothless vamp). This mirrors the broader post-war feeling of disillusionment with wartime ideals.
*   **The Parasitic Woman:** The actress is described as a "vampire" who "sucks the lifeblood" of the man. This is a common misogynistic trope where a woman's sexuality is presented as a literal threat to male vitality and professional success.
*   **Professional Fall from Grace:** The story uses the high-stakes world of professional baseball to heighten the drama. The transition from "Star Pitcher" to "Fainting Outfielder" represents a total loss of masculine prowess.
*   **The "Confession" Format:** By writing in the first person, the story creates an air of "true life" scandal, common in tabloid-style fiction of the time.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Fiction, Serialized Story.
*   **Genre:** Ero-guro, Melodrama, Sports Drama (Baseball).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Scandal, Femme Fatale, Professional Sports, Post-war Japan, Disillusionment, Moral Decay.
