僕の男妾の告白

中原 春美

其の頃僕は市内の商業學校に通つてゐた、たしか五年生であつた、家には自動車の運轉手をしてゐる兄と若い嫂と僕の三人が住んでゐた。
両親はもうとつくに死んでしまつて、僕は兄の給料によつて學校へやつてもらつていた。しかし兄の収入といふのは、僅かの給料と手當だけであつたので、兄は好きな晩酌さえも控え目にして僕の學費を出してくれていたのだ。
このつつましい兄の家計の大きな負擔となつている僕であつたので、早く卒業してどこかの商事會社へでも勤めて獨立したいと常々願つていた。
それが意外なことから案外早く兄の家を出ることになつてしまつた。それは此れから述べる僕の男妾の告白と大いに関係のあることなのである。僕が兄の家を出て獨立したいと願つたことは、兄の収入の少ないといふこと以外に、僕が毎晩気を使わなくてはならないことが一つあつた。
前にも言つた様に兄は薄給の上を僕の學費まで出していて呉れたので一軒の家を借りる事も出来ず、或る煙草屋の二階を貸して貰つて住んでいた。二階は三畳が梯子段の上り口にありその隣りに六畳一室があつた。
兄夫婦は六畳に、僕は入口の三畳に寢ていた。僕が五年生になつて間のない或る春の夜、床に入つたまゝ寝られないで長い間天井を見つめたまゝで眼を開いていた。
近くの省線電車の音が間遠うになつたのは、もう大分夜も更けたのだらう。隣りの室の間には破れ襖があるばかりで嫂のささやく聲が手にとる様に隔れ聞こえてきた。
「康夫さんが起きているわよ」
「もうとつくに寝入つてるよ、いいぢやないか」
兄の太い聲も混つている。寢ようと焦るが内気で気の弱い僕も思春期を迎えているので、悩ましい幻想にさいなまれ眼がさえた中々變つくどころの騒ぎではない。身動きもならずちつと身体を固くして目をつむつているが、聞かないとしても耳からは隣室からはいろいろな物音や低い話し聲が絶え間なく聞えてくる。

それでも隣室に寝ている時はまだよかつたが、夏を迎えて蚊帳が一張しかない爲に、僕も兄夫婦の片隅で同じ蚊帳の中に寝ることになつた。
晝の太陽に焼けた屋根は中々夜となつても冷えず只さえ窮屈しい天井の低い中二階の部屋である。
夜半にふと寢覚めた僕の隣りで兄夫婦のつつましい睦言を聞くのは耐えられなかつた。
内気で非社交的な僕ではあつたが時折り友人の家へ泊つたりしたこともあつた。そして平常の僕の孤獨さは益々ひどくなつて、嫂とも殆んど必要以外は話もしない位無口で、ひまさえあれば小説に読み耽つていた。
それでいて僕と年齢の余り違わない嫂の若々しい肉體にまぶしい様なあこがれをどうすることも出来なかつた。
映画を見たり喫茶店へ行つたりすることははやっていたが、そんな事に使う金などもなく、登校の電車賃も兄に言つて貰うのが気がねで、停留所が五つばかりある間を歩いて通つたりしていた。

途中に大きな公園があつて、その中の道を通ると大分近道であつた。
帰り道など時間があると、公園のベンチに腰をかけたり、芝生の木蔭に寝ころんだりして岩波文庫に読みふけつた。
氷屋の旗が方々にチラ／＼し出した七月のはじめ、僕は学校の帰り途を例のように公園の中に選んで、明るい緑の光線の反射する樹立の中を歩いて行つた。
植物園の前には大きな椚の木があつて木蔭を作つていた。僕はその下のベンチに腰かけて、やがて近づいて來る學期末試験の下調べをしようと思つた。
狭く暑苦しい家へ歸つても、思う様に勉強出来ないように思えたからであるし、又僕の孤独性が然らしめたのかも知れない。さすがに季節はずれで人通りも少なかつたが、蝉取りの子供が三四人樹立の間を行つたり来たりしていた。
冷やりとする涼しい風に汗を入れて僕は鞄から代数の教科書を出すと試験範圍のところの練習題をやり出した。

僕の男妾（だんしょう）の告白

中原 春美

其の頃、僕は市内の商業学校に通っていた。たしか五年生であった。家には自動車の運転手をしている兄と、若い嫂（あによめ）と僕の三人が住んでいた。
両親はもうとっくに死んでしまって、僕は兄の給料によって学校へやってもらっていた。しかし兄の収入というのは、僅かな給料と手当だけであったので、兄は好きな晩酌さえも控えめにして僕の学費を出してくれていたのだ。
このつつましい兄の家計の大きな負担となっている僕であったので、早く卒業してどこかの商事会社へでも勤めて独立したいと常々願っていた。
それが意外なことから案外早く兄の家を出ることになってしまった。それはこれから述べる「僕の男妾の告白」と大いに関係のあることなのである。僕が兄の家を出て独立したいと願ったことは、兄の収入の少ないということ以外に、僕が毎晩気を使わなければならないことが一つあった。

前にも言ったように兄は薄給の上、僕の学費まで出してくれていたので、一軒の家を借りることもできず、ある煙草屋の二階を貸してもらって住んでいた。二階は三畳が梯子段の上り口にあり、その隣に六畳一室があった。
兄夫婦は六畳に、僕は入り口の三畳に寝ていた。僕が五年生になって間もないある春の夜、床に入ったまま眠れないで長い間天井を見つめたままで目を開いていた。
近くの省線電車の音が間遠くなったのは、もうだいぶ夜も更けたのだろう。隣の室の間には破れ襖があるばかりで、嫂のささやく声が手にとるように隔て聞こえてきた。
「康夫さんが起きているわよ」
「もうとっくに寝入ってるよ、いいじゃないか」
兄の太い声も混じっている。寝ようと焦るが、内気で気の弱い僕も思春期を迎えているので、悩ましい幻想にさいなまれ目が冴え、なかなか寝つくどころの騒ぎではない。身動きもならず、ちょっと身体を固くして目をつむっているが、聞かないとしても耳からは隣室からはいろいろな物音や低い話し声が絶え間なく聞こえてくる。

それでも隣室に寝ている時はまだよかったが、夏を迎えて蚊帳が一張しかないために、僕も兄夫婦の片隅で同じ蚊帳の中に寝ることになった。
昼の太陽に焼けた屋根はなかなか夜になっても冷えず、ただでさえ窮屈な天井の低い中二階の部屋である。
夜半にふと目覚めた僕の隣で兄夫婦のつつましい睦言（むつごと）を聞くのは耐えられなかった。
内気で非社交的な僕ではあったが、時折友人の家へ泊まったりしたこともあった。そして日常の僕の孤独さはますますひどくなって、嫂ともほとんど必要以外は話もしないくらい無口で、暇さえあれば小説に読み耽っていた。
それでいて僕と年齢のあまり違わない嫂の若々しい肉体に、まぶしいような憧れをどうすることもできなかった。
映画を見たり喫茶店へ行ったりすることは流行っていたが、そんなことに使う金もなく、登校の電車賃も兄に言ってもらうのが気がねで、停留所が五つばかりある間を歩いて通ったりしていた。

途中に大きな公園があって、その中の道を通るとだいぶ近道であった。

**Confessions of My Male Concubine**

**Nakahara Harumi**

At that time, I was attending a commercial school in the city. To be sure, I was a fifth-year student. In the house, my elder brother who was working as an automobile driver, his young wife (my sister-in-law), and I—the three of us—were living.
My parents had already died long ago, and I was being sent to school by my brother's salary. However, because my brother's income consisted only of a meager salary and allowances, my brother kept even his favorite evening drinks to a minimum and was providing my school fees.
Since I was a great burden on this frugal brother's household finances, I was always wishing to graduate quickly and work at some trading company or other to become independent.
Due to an unexpected thing, I ended up leaving my brother's house surprisingly early. That is something that has a great relationship with the "Confessions of My Male Concubine" which I am about to describe. Regarding my wishing to leave my brother's house and become independent, besides the fact that my brother's income was small, there was one thing I had to worry about every night.

As I said before, because my brother, on top of a low wage, was even providing my school fees, we could not do things like renting a whole house; we received a rental of the second floor of a certain cigarette shop and lived there. On the second floor, a three-mat room was at the top of the ladder-stairs, and next to it, there was one six-mat room.
The brother couple slept in the six mat room, and I slept in the three mat room at the entrance. On a certain spring night not long after I became a fifth-year student, I stayed in bed unable to sleep, and remained staring at the ceiling for a long time with eyes open.
The sound of the nearby Ministry of Railways trains becoming infrequent meant the night had likely deepened considerably. Between the adjacent rooms there was only a torn sliding door (fusuma), and my sister-in-law's whispering voice came through as if it were right there in my hand.
"Yasuo-san is awake."
"He's fallen asleep long ago; isn't it fine?"
My brother's thick voice was also mixed in. I hurried to try to sleep, but I, being shy and weak-willed and also greeting adolescence, was tormented by distressing fantasies and my eyes were clear—it was not a matter of easily falling asleep. Without even moving, stiffening my body a little and keeping my eyes closed, even if I tried not to listen, from my ears, various noises and low speaking voices from the next room came without ceasing.

Even so, when sleeping in the next room it was still okay, but facing summer, because there was only one mosquito net, I too came to sleep inside the same mosquito net in a corner of the brother couple.
The roof heated by the midday sun did not cool even when it became night; it was a mezzanine room with a low ceiling that was cramped to begin with.
To suddenly wake up at midnight and hear the frugal pillow talk of the brother couple next to me was unbearable.
Although I was shy and unsociable, there were times I stayed at a friend's house. And my usual loneliness became increasingly severe; I was so reticent I barely spoke with my sister-in-law beyond necessity, and whenever I had a moment, I was absorbed in reading novels.
In spite of that, toward my sister-in-law's youthful body, which was not much different from my own age, I could not help a dazzling-like longing.
Going to movies or cafes was in fashion, but I had no money to use for such things, and even the train fare for school was awkward to ask my brother for, so I would sometimes walk the distance of about five stops.

On the way there was a large park, and passing through the path inside was a considerable shortcut.
On the way home, when there was time, I sat on a park bench or lay down in the shade of the grass and became absorbed in reading Iwanami Bunko books.
At the beginning of July when ice shop flags began to appear here and there, I chose the park for my school commute as usual and walked through the groves where bright green light rays reflected.
In front of the botanical garden, there was a large sawtooth oak tree making shade. I sat on the bench under it and thought I would do the prep work for the approaching end-of-term exams.
Because even if I returned to the cramped and sultry house, I felt I could not study as I wished, and also my lonely nature might have caused it. As expected for the off-season, there were few people passing by, but three or four children catching cicadas were going back and forth between the groves.
Letting the sweat subside in the chilly, cool breeze, I took the algebra textbook out of my bag and started doing the practice problems for the exam range.

**The Confessions of a Kept Boy**

**By Harumi Nakahara**

At that time, I was a fifth-year student at a commercial high school in the city. Our household consisted of three people: my elder brother, who worked as a chauffeur; his young wife; and myself. My parents had passed away years ago, and my brother supported my education with his earnings. However, his income was meager—barely a base salary and a few allowances—so he even had to cut back on his nightly drinks to afford my tuition. 

Because I was such a heavy burden on his modest household, I constantly wished to graduate, find work at a trading firm, and finally become independent. Yet, due to an unexpected turn of events, I ended up leaving his home much sooner than anticipated. This departure is deeply entwined with the "confessions" I am about to share. While my desire for independence was partly fueled by my brother’s financial situation, there was another reason: a source of nightly anxiety that weighed heavily upon me.

As I mentioned, my brother’s low wages meant we couldn't afford a house of our own. Instead, we rented the second floor of a neighborhood tobacco shop. The layout was cramped: a tiny three-mat room sat at the top of the stairs, adjacent to a larger six-mat room. My brother and his wife slept in the larger room, while I took the small one by the entrance. 

One spring night, shortly after starting my fifth year, I lay in bed, unable to sleep, staring up at the ceiling. The sounds of the government trains in the distance grew infrequent, a sign that the night was late. The partition between our rooms was nothing more than a set of tattered paper doors, and my sister-in-law’s whispers drifted through so clearly it felt as though she were right beside me.

"I think Yasuo is still awake," she said.
"He fell asleep ages ago," my brother’s gruff voice replied. "Don't worry about it."

I felt a desperate urge to fall asleep, but as a shy, sensitive boy entering adolescence, I was tormented by restless fantasies. I was wide awake, my mind racing. I lay there perfectly still, my body rigid, eyes clamped shut. Even so, I couldn't help but hear the rustling sounds and low murmurs of their intimacy from the next room.

Sleeping in an adjacent room was difficult enough, but when summer arrived, things grew worse. We had only one mosquito net, which meant I had to sleep inside it, tucked into a corner beside the couple. The roof, baked by the midday sun, held its heat long into the night. It was a stifling mezzanine room with a low, oppressive ceiling. Waking up in the middle of the night to the sound of my brother and his wife’s private whispers right next to me was more than I could bear.

Naturally introverted and unsociable, my sense of isolation deepened. I grew so taciturn that I barely spoke to my sister-in-law except when absolutely necessary. Whenever I had a free moment, I buried myself in novels. Yet, I couldn't suppress a blinding sort of longing for her youthful body, as she was not much older than I was. While others my age were frequenting cinemas and cafes, I had no money for such luxuries. I even felt guilty asking my brother for tram fare, so I often walked the distance of five stops to school.

On my way home, I would take a shortcut through a large park. If I had time, I’d sit on a bench or lie on the grass, losing myself in an Iwanami Bunko paperback. In early July, as the "Ice" flags began to flutter outside shops, I walked through the park's lush, sun-dappled groves. Finding shade under a large sawtooth oak near the botanical garden, I decided to study for my upcoming final exams. Our home was too cramped and sweltering to get any real work done, or perhaps it was just my solitary nature drawing me away. The park was quiet, with only a few children chasing cicadas among the trees. As a cool breeze finally began to dry my sweat, I pulled my algebra textbook from my bag and began working through the practice problems.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout**: The text is arranged in traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tategaki*), reading from right to left.
*   **Structure**: The page features a clear title in a large, bold font, followed by the author's name. The body text is organized into four distinct columns of varying lengths.
*   **Typography**: The font is a classic Mincho style, typical of mid-20th-century Japanese printing. The use of *kyūjitai* (traditional kanji forms) and historical kana usage (e.g., ゐる instead of いる) suggests a publication date prior to or shortly after the script reforms of 1946, or a literary magazine maintaining older styles.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The title "僕の男妾の告白" is the largest element, centered vertically on the far right. The author's name "中原 春美" is smaller and placed slightly lower.
*   **Formatting Elements**: The page number "— 28 —" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger publication like a magazine or a short story collection.
*   **Punctuation**: It uses Japanese commas (、) and periods (。), as well as quotation marks (「 」) for dialogue. Repetition marks (々) and iteration marks for kana (ゝ, ゞ) are also present.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era**: Based on the orthography (traditional kanji) and the mention of the "Ministry of Railways" (*Shōsen*), this text likely dates to the **late 1930s to late 1940s**. The term *Shōsen* (省線) refers to lines operated by the Ministry of Railways, a term used until 1949.
*   **Socio-economic Setting**: The narrator's brother is a chauffeur, a common working-class occupation of the era. They live in a rented room above a cigarette shop, highlighting the cramped housing conditions and poverty of urban working-class life in pre/post-war Japan.
*   **Education System**: The "fifth year of commercial school" (商業学校五年生) refers to the old educational system (pre-1947), where vocational middle schools typically lasted five years. A fifth-year student would be roughly 16–17 years old, which aligns with the narrator's mention of "entering adolescence."
*   **The "Danshō" (男妾)**: The title is provocative. Historically, *danshō* (male concubine/favorite) refers to a young man kept for sexual or emotional companionship, often by an older man. In the context of mid-century "pulp" or "kasutori" magazines, such titles were used to attract readers with the promise of scandal or taboo subjects (homosexuality, incestuous tension, or "kept man" dynamics).
*   **Iwanami Bunko (岩波文庫)**: Mentioned as the narrator's reading material. These were (and are) prestigious, affordable pocket editions of classic literature and philosophy. Reading them marks the narrator as an intellectual or a serious student, contrasting with his impoverished surroundings.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **男妾 (Danshō)**: Literally "male concubine." Usually implies a kept man or a male sex worker. Its use in the title suggests a sensationalist or "confessional" genre.
*   **嫂 (Aniyome/Anayome)**: Sister-in-law (specifically the wife of one's elder brother).
*   **省線 (Shōsen)**: Short for *Tetsudō-shō-sen* (Ministry of Railways Line). A term used for what is now the JR lines in Tokyo/Osaka before 1949.
*   **中二階 (Chū-nikai)**: A mezzanine or a room with a very low ceiling located between floors, often used for storage or as cheap housing.
*   **睦言 (Mutzugoto)**: Pillow talk; intimate conversation between lovers/spouses in bed.
*   **一張 (Isshō)**: The counter for mosquito nets.
*   **蚊帳 (Kaya)**: Mosquito net. A staple of Japanese summers before air conditioning and window screens became common.
*   **椚 (Kunugi)**: Sawtooth oak. A common tree in Japanese parks and forests.
*   **気兼ね (Kigane)**: Feeling hesitant or awkward due to consideration for others' feelings or a sense of debt.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Adolescent Awakening & Voyeurism**: The core of this excerpt is the narrator's uncomfortable proximity to his brother's married life. The thin walls and shared mosquito net force a physical and auditory intimacy that triggers the narrator's sexual awakening and subsequent guilt.
*   **Poverty and Debt**: The narrator's feelings of being a "burden" (*futan*) create a psychological weight. His inability to pay for small luxuries like the train or a cafe reinforces his isolation.
*   **Isolation and Escapism**: The narrator retreats into novels and parks to escape the "suffocating" (*kyūkutsu*) atmosphere of his home. His "solitary nature" is a defense mechanism against his confusing feelings for his sister-in-law.
*   **Class and Aspiration**: Despite his poverty, the narrator is a student at a commercial school reading high-brow literature (Iwanami Bunko). There is a tension between his intellectual leanings and his humble, cramped reality.
*   **Sensationalism**: The title "Confessions of a Male Concubine" stands in sharp contrast to the somewhat somber, "I-novel" (*shishōsetsu*) style of the text. This was a common tactic in magazines of that era to frame psychological dramas as scandalous "true confessions."

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type**: Fiction, Short Story, Confessional Literature.
*   **Primary Genre**: *Shishōsetsu* (I-novel), Ero-Guro-Nonsense (implied by title/era), Coming-of-age drama.
*   **Themes**: Poverty, Adolescence, Forbidden Desire, Urban Life, Family Dynamics, Intellectualism.
*   **Classification**: Adult/Literary (due to mature themes of sexual tension and historical provocative terminology).
