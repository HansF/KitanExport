文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き

れる鬼といひつべし。恋絹あるにもあらぬ思ひ、
恋　私を殺すとおっしゃるも、銀からおこった事なれば、
路銀も残らず上げましょう。まだ其上に此衣類、はいで
なりとも助けてたべ。つらい命をながらえて、陸奥まで
さまよふも、何とぞ安う産みたいばかり、よくよく深い
縁なればこそ、わたしがおなかをかり初めも、十月に及
ぶやどり子に、せめて此世のあかりを見せ一日なりとも
親子よ子と、互に呼び呼ばるるまで、命が惜しい、死に
ともない。慈悲じゃ、情ぢゃ、コレまうし……。
へ取り付き歎けど聞かぬ顔
というわけで、老婆は懐剣逆手に恋絹に襲いかかってゆく
のである。
へ息の根をとめよと突っかかる、刃先をよけてもよけさせ
ず、付けまはしつ追い廻り、なんなく肩先切りこまれ、
立つ足さえもたぢたぢ、又突っくる白刃の切先、
その切先を恋絹は手でうけとめるのである。
へ懐剣しどけば紅の血汐に染る手を合せ
恋　どうぞお慈悲に、連合の帰られるまで。せめて名残に
たった一目、逢うて死にたい顔見たい。生駒さまいのう。
我つまさまいのう。
へと泣きさけぶ、声さえいとど遠近の、空吹く風の音ばか
り
婆　コリヤ世話やくないわい。その連合はな、方角知れぬ
山中へ、突放して戻ったれば、今時分は、猪や狼に喰殺
されておるであろう。夫に逢いたか、早う冥土さへやっ
てやろ
へとたぶさ掴んで肝のたばね、刺通されて七顛八倒、苦し
む体はくるくるくる、輪乗りのごとく打ちまたがり、乳
の下より十文字に、腹裁破る有様は、目も当てられずむ
ごらしき。
こうしてその後で、この老婆が、実は恋絹の実の母である
ことがわかるのである。

「……れる鬼と言うべし。恋絹（こいぎぬ）はあるにもあらぬ思い、」
恋絹「私を殺すとおっしゃるも、銀（かね）から起こった事なれば、路銀も残らず上げましょう。まだその上にこの衣類、剥いでなりとも助けてたもれ。つらい命を長らえて、陸奥（みちのく）まで彷徨うも、何とぞ安く産みたいばかり。よくよく深い縁なればこそ、私がお腹を借り初めも、十ヶ月に及ぶ宿り子に、せめてこの世の明かりを見せ、一日なりとも親子よ子と、互いに呼び呼ばれるまで、命が惜しい、死にたくない。慈悲じゃ、情けじゃ、これ、もし……」
（地）取り付き嘆けど聞かぬ顔
というわけで、老婆は懐剣（かいけん）を逆手に恋絹に襲いかかってゆくのである。
（地）息の根を止めよと突っかかる。刃先を避けても避けさせず、付け回しつつ追い回り、難なく肩先を切り込まれ、立つ足さえもたじたじ。また突いてくる白刃の切先、その切先を恋絹は手で受け止めるのである。
（地）懐剣しごけば紅の血汐に染まる手を合わせ
恋絹「どうぞお慈悲に、連れ合いの帰られるまで。せめて名残にたった一目、会って死にたい、顔見たい。生駒様いのう。我が夫（つま）様いのう。」

（地）とたぶさ（髪）掴んで肝の束ね、刺し通されて七転八倒、苦しむ体はくるくるくる、輪乗りのごとく打ち跨がり、乳の下より十文字に、腹裁ち破る有様は、目も当てられずむごたらしい。
こうしてその後で、この老婆が、実は恋絹の実の母であることが判明するのである。

こういう惨虐な場面の描写を得意とした劇作家の鶴屋南北であるから、南北の作品にこういう場面が出てこないわけがない。
彼は七十三歳の時に書いた『独道中五十三駅（ひとりたびごじゅうさんつぎ）』の中で、非人（ひにん）江戸兵衛（実は藤川水右衛門）が、八ツ橋村のお松の腹を裂くという場面を描いている。この劇は岡崎の猫騒動に亀山の仇討、重の井（しげのい）姫からお半長右衛門、権八長兵衛に弥次喜多と、色々な役が雑多に出てくる、いかにも南北らしい劇なのだが、中でも非人・江戸兵衛は特に南北らしい線の太い人物である。

Women's Abdomen-Ripping as Appeared in Literature

...should be called a demon. Koiginu, with a feeling of being and not being,
Koiginu: "Even if you say you will kill me, since it started from silver (money), I will give you all the travel money without leaving any. Furthermore, these clothes, even if you strip them, please save me. Even though I endure a painful life and wander as far as Michinoku, it is only because I want to give birth safely. Because it is a very deep fate, the child staying in my womb for ten months, at least I want to show the light of this world, even for one day, until we call each other parent and child—life is precious, I do not want to die. Mercy, compassion, hey, listen..."
(Narrative) She clings and laments, but he shows a face that does not listen.
And so, the old woman, holding a dagger in a reverse grip, attacks Koiginu.
(Narrative) Rushing to stop her breath. Even if she dodges the blade, he does not let her dodge, following and chasing her around, her shoulder is easily cut into, her standing feet are faltering. Again the tip of the white blade comes thrusting; Koiginu catches that tip with her hands.
(Narrative) As she grips the dagger, she joins her hands stained in crimson blood.
Koiginu: "Please, out of mercy, until my husband returns. At least as a final memory, just one glance, I want to meet and die, I want to see his face. Lord Ikoma. My dear husband."
(Narrative) The voice screaming thus is only the sound of the wind blowing through the sky near and far.
Old Woman: "Hey, don't be a nuisance. That husband, you see, I pushed him off into the trackless mountains and came back; by now, he must have been eaten and killed by boars or wolves. You want to meet your husband? I'll send you to the underworld quickly."
(Narrative) Grabbing her hair (tabusa), bundling the liver-area, pierced through and writhing in agony, the suffering body goes round and round, straddling her like a wheel-ride, from below the breast in a cross shape, the state of ripping open the belly is too miserable to look at.
Thus, after that, it is revealed that this old woman is actually Koiginu's biological mother.

Because it is the playwright Tsuruya Nanboku, who specialized in depicting such cruel scenes, there is no way such scenes would not appear in Nanboku's works.
In "Hitori Tabi Gojusan Tsugi," written when he was 73, he depicts a scene where the pariah Edobei (actually Fujikawa Mizuemon) rips open the belly of Omatsu of Yatsuhashi village. This play features the Cat Disturbance of Okazaki, the Kameyama Revenge, Princess Shigenoi, Ohan and Choemon, Gonpachi and Chobei, and Yaji and Kita—a variety of roles appearing in a jumble, a very Nanboku-like play; among them, the pariah Edobei is a particularly bold Nanboku-style character.
"The stage is a pariah's house and a gruesome atmosphere. The bell of time. The sound of insects. Here, Omatsu is fixed to a hide-drying board with iron clamps (kasugai), tied with straw rope, leaned against a suitable spot; fuel is put into the hearth, mosquito incense is set; Edobei is in the state of reading what is written on the back of the small-sleeved robe by an old lamp; the stage props settle."
Thus, even something like nailing a pregnant woman to a board with clamps is very much in Nanboku's taste. Moreover, it turns out that Edobei is the enemy who killed Omatsu's parent.
In short, it is a strange form of "revenge in reverse."
Omatsu: "...Then, killing my father was also your doing. Because of you, the enemy, it is regrettable to lose my life. If my hands won't work, I'll bite you—hey, won't someone come?"

**Women’s Disembowelment in Literature**

"...a demon, truly," one might say. Koiginu, her heart suspended between hope and despair, pleads:
**Koiginu:** "You say you mean to kill me, but since this is all about money, I will give you every coin of my travel funds. You may even strip the very clothes from my back—only, I beg you, spare my life. I have endured this agonizing existence and wandered as far as the northern wilds of Michinoku for one reason alone: to give birth safely. It is surely a profound destiny that has kept this child in my womb for these ten months. I only wish to let the child see the light of this world, if only for a single day, so that we may call one another mother and child. Life is precious to me; I do not want to die! Have mercy! Have pity! Please, I implore you..."
*(Narrative)* She clings to her attacker, weeping, but meets only a cold, indifferent gaze.
Thus, the old woman, dagger held in a reverse grip, lunges at Koiginu.
*(Narrative)* She strikes to end her life. Koiginu tries to dodge, but the blade follows her relentlessly. Cornered and hounded, her shoulder is sliced open; she staggers on failing legs. Again, the glinting white blade thrusts toward her, and in desperation, Koiginu catches the sharp edge with her bare hands.
*(Narrative)* As she clenches the blade, her hands are dyed in crimson blood. She presses them together in prayer.
**Koiginu:** "By your mercy, let me wait until my husband returns. Just one last look—I want to see his face before I die. Oh, Lord Ikoma! My dear husband!"
*(Narrative)* Her piercing screams fade into the empty air, drowned out by the whistling wind.
**Old Woman:** "Stop your whining! That husband of yours—I cast him off into the pathless mountains before I returned. By now, the boars and wolves have surely torn him to pieces. You want to see him? Then I shall send you to the afterworld at once!"
*(Narrative)* Grabbing Koiginu by the hair, the old woman pins her down and stabs her through. Writhing in agony, Koiginu’s body twists and turns as her attacker straddles her. With a crosswise cut starting beneath the breast, the belly is ripped open—a sight so gruesome one can hardly bear to look.
Later, it is revealed that this old woman was, in fact, Koiginu’s biological mother.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is a standard vertical-text layout (tategaki) typical of Japanese books.
*   **Typography:** The main body text is in a clear, modern serif typeface. Small "furigana" (reading aids) are used occasionally for difficult kanji (e.g., 懐剣 *kaiken*, 鎹 *kasugai*).
*   **Visual Elements:** At the top of the page, there is a horizontal woodblock-style (ukiyo-e) illustration. It depicts a dramatic scene: a man in a patterned kimono (Edobei) holds a woman (Omatsu) down while brandishing a blade. This provides a visual anchor for the "cruel" themes discussed.
*   **Structure:**
    1.  **Header:** Page number and chapter title.
    2.  **Literary Excerpt (Top Half):** A dramatized retelling or direct quote from a script/novel featuring Koiginu and an old woman.
    3.  **Critical Analysis (Bottom Half):** The author’s commentary on Tsuruya Nanboku IV and his penchant for "cruelty" (*zankoku*).
    4.  **Secondary Excerpt:** A description of the stage set and dialogue for another play, *Hitori Tabi Gojusan Tsugi*.
*   **Signifiers:** The use of "へ" symbols at the start of lines indicates narrative stage directions (chanto/jōruri style) in Kabuki scripts.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Tsuruya Nanboku IV (1755–1829):** The most famous playwright of the late Edo period. He is the master of the *Kizewamono* genre (raw, realistic plays about the lower classes) and *Kaidan* (ghost stories). He is renowned for "Nanboku-style" cruelty and the use of *Nise-en-en* (ironic twists where relatives unknowingly kill each other).
*   **Kizewamono (Raw Domestic Plays):** Unlike the stylized, heroic *Jidaimono* plays, these focused on the gritty, often violent lives of commoners, criminals, and outcasts (*hinin*).
*   **The Theme of "Hara-saki" (Belly-ripping):** While *seppuku* (ritual suicide) was seen as honorable for samurai, the "ripping open" of a woman's belly (often a pregnant woman) was used in Kabuki to maximize "cruelty" (*zankoku-bi* or the beauty of cruelty) and pathos.
*   **Nise-en (Mismatched Fate):** A recurring trope where a character commits a crime (murder/robbery) only to find out the victim was their long-lost child or parent. This maximizes the tragedy and "karmic" weight of the scene.
*   **Edobei/Fujikawa Mizuemon:** This refers to the villain of the play *Dokudochū Gojūsantsugi*. Nanboku often reused character names and archetypes.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **銀 (Gin/Kane):** Historically "silver," but used here generically for money or travel funds (*rogin*).
*   **陸奥 (Michinoku):** The ancient name for the northern part of Honshu (Tohoku region), implying a long, arduous journey.
*   **鎹 (Kasugai):** A large iron staple or clamp used in woodworking. In this context, it is used as a horrific torture device to pin a person to a board.
*   **非人 (Hinin):** Literally "non-human." A historical outcast class in the Edo period. Edobei being a *hinin* marks him as someone outside the normal social order.
*   **七顛八倒 (Shitten-battō):** A four-character idiom (yojijukugo) meaning to writhe in great pain or to be in a state of utter confusion/agony.
*   **たぶさ (Tabusa/Motoyui):** The topknot or the part of the hair where it is tied.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Cruelty as Aesthetic:** The text analyzes how Nanboku utilized extreme violence (disembowelment of a pregnant woman) as a theatrical tool to evoke strong emotional responses (*zankoku no bi*).
*   **Irony and Tragedy:** The subtext of the first scene is the "parent-child" tragedy. The mother kills the daughter for money, unaware of their relation. This reflects the Buddhist concept of *Inma* (bad karma) and the chaotic nature of the "floating world" (Ukiyo).
*   **The Vulnerability of Women:** The text highlights how women—particularly pregnant women—are used as the ultimate symbols of pathos (*aware*) in Edo-period drama. Their physical destruction represents the ultimate violation of the natural order.
*   **Social Realism vs. Fantasy:** While the violence is extreme, it is grounded in the "realistic" settings of the lower classes, making the horror more visceral for the contemporary audience.
