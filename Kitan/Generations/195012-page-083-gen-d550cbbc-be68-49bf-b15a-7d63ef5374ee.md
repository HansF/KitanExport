江戸に出て来たが、何処へ行くと云う目的はない。将軍のお膝元、二百六十余大名が軒を並べている。何か就職口があるだろう、そう思って小幡金平は江戸へ出た。噂にきいたり、空想していた以上に江戸は繁華だつた。
金平は毎日眼を丸くして江戸の街を見物して歩いた。勿論就職口を探す事は忘れない。湯屋の三助、米屋の手代、ばくち打の用心棒――そんな口ならいつでもあると、旅籠の番頭は教えてくれたが、今は浪人でもつい此の間迄は、たとえ三十石でも武士の端くれだつたと云う自尊心がある。
泰平の御代、剣術では抱え手もなく、日に／＼財布は軽くなり、もううか／＼と江戸見物どころではなく、今日も足を棒にして歩き廻つた挙句、上野の山、清水堂の脇にぼんやり疲れ切つて腰を下した。
――つまらぬ事になつたものだ。秋風が忙しくハタ／＼と金平の袂を吹き抜けて、木の葉がクル／＼舞つて行くのを眺めて、彼はそぞろに故郷を偲んだ。

風が冷たい。肌を刺すようだ。
――大体俺は女に甘すぎる。しかし分らぬもんだな女心と云うやつは……。
金平は瞼に雪路の面影をフッと思い浮かべた。そしてあの日の出来事をつく／＼ホロ苦く胸にかみしめて見るのであつた。
肥後新田、二万五千石細川左京の近習役として金平は可愛がられていた。役目柄自然と腰元と接する機会も多い。無二の親友成瀬逸馬が、腰元中でも抜群の美女雪路を見染めたまではよかったが、
「頼む！この艶文、思いのたけをかいた文をどうにかして雪路にそっと手渡してくれ。」と頼まれて断わりきれず引受けたものゝ、金平はがっかりした。と云うのが秘かに金平自身雪路を傍から思つていた矢先。友の頼みに否とは云えず、小さくたたんだ文を握らされて、

仕方がない、万人の認めるところ、俺より逸馬の方が美男だし、それに家柄もよい。あきらめて眼をつぶるか――と、すご／＼とお鏡口から引退ろうとした出会頭、今も今、その噂の雪路とバッタリ出くわしたのだつた。ハッとして身を引いたが、今こそ逸馬から預つた附文渡すチャンスと、黒い顔を赤銅色に染めて、
「雪、雪路どの……実はそれ、そのう……。」
「ハイ、何か私に……」
つぶらな黒い眼をパッチリ見ひらいて、凝っと顔を見つめられると、益々へどもどして、金平はじんわり汗ばんでクシャ／＼になつた文を突出して、
「――こ、この文を読んで戴き度いと……ハッそ、そのうあなたを見染めて、いや、どうしても自分の口からは云い出しにくいと……」
「まあ、金平さま。わたしに……」
途端にパッと紅葉をちらした顔を伏せて雪路はサッとそれを引つたくると、
「――お嬉しゆう存じます……。」
と云うなり振袖で顔を蔽つてかけ出した。

江戸に出て来たが、どこへ行くという目的はない。将軍のお膝元、二百六十余大名が軒を並べている。何か就職口があるだろう、そう思って小幡金平（おばた・こんぺい）は江戸へ出た。噂に聞いたり、空想していた以上に江戸は繁華だった。
金平は毎日目を丸くして江戸の街を見物して歩いた。もちろん就職口を探すことは忘れない。湯屋の三助、米屋の手代、博打打ちの用心棒――そんな口ならいつでもあらゆると、旅籠の番頭は教えてくれたが、今は浪人でもついこの間までは、たとえ三十石でも武士の端くれだったという自尊心がある。

Edo into come-out arrived but, where to go called purpose is not. Shogun’s knees-base (Edo), 260-plus Daimyo eaves are lining up. Something job-opening exist probably, so thinking, Obata Konpei to Edo went out. Rumors in heard, or imagination was doing more than, Edo bustling was.
Konpei every day eyes round-making Edo’s town sightseeing doing walked. Of course, job-opening searching thing not-forget. Bathhouse’s assistant (Sanjū), rice-shop’s clerk, gambler’s bodyguard—such openings if anytime exist, inn’s head clerk told him, but now Ronin even just recently until, even if 30 koku even samurai’s scrap (end) was called pride exists.
Peaceful reign, swordsmanship in hire-hand without, day-by-day wallet light becomes, already carelessly Edo-sightseeing place-not-at, today also legs into sticks making walking-around result, Ueno’s mountain, Kiyomizu-do side in blankly exhausted sitting-down did.
—Trivial thing became. Autumn wind busily flap-flap Konpei’s sleeve blowing-through, tree leaves round-and-round dancing going-away watching, he restlessly hometown remembered.

Wind cold. Skin pierces-like.
—Generally I woman to too-sweet. However not-know thing is, woman’s heart called thing is...
Konpei eyelids-in Yukiji’s image "poof" thought-floated. And that day’s event deeply bittersweetly heart-in biting-chewing tried.
Higo-Shinden, 25,000 koku Hosokawa Sakyo’s attendant as Konpei favored was. Nature of job, naturally maidservants with contact opportunities many. Unique best friend Naruse Itsuma, maidservants among outstanding beauty Yukiji fell-in-love-with until good was but,
"Beg! This love-letter, heart’s-fullness wrote letter somehow Yukiji to softly hand-over give." and begged-being refuse-could-not accepted thing, Konpei disappointed was. Called thing is secretly Konpei himself Yukiji from-side thinking-was point. Friend’s request to "no" could not say, small folded letter grasped-being...

No-way-out. Everyone’s recognizing place (fact), me than Itsuma more handsome, and family-lineage also good. Give up eyes close or—and, dejectedly Kagami-guchi (doorway) from withdrawing-tried moment, now of now, that rumored Yukiji with "bam" encountered it was. "Ah!" doing body-pulled, but now indeed Itsuma from entrusted attached-letter passing chance and, black face copper-color into dyeing,
"Yuki, Yukiji-dono... Actually that, um..."
"Yes, something to me..."
Round black eyes wide-open, intently face being-stared-at, increasingly stuttering, Konpei gradually sweating-with crumpled-up-became letter thrust-out,
"—This, this letter read-want and... Ah, that, um, you fell-in-love-with, no, by-all-means own mouth from say-out-difficult and..."
"Oh, Konpei-sama. To me..."
Instant "poof" autumn-leaves scattered face bowing Yukiji "zip" that snatched-away then,
"—Honored-happy I feel..."
Saying-straight-away sleeve with face covering ran-out.

**The Mansion of Love and Hate**
**By Takehiko Enishi**
**Illustrated by Toshitaka Suma**

— 1 —

He had come to Edo, but he had no clear destination. In the Shogun's capital, where over two hundred and sixty lords lined the streets, Obata Konpei figured he was bound to find work somewhere. Edo turned out to be even more bustling than the rumors and his own imagination had led him to believe.
Each day, Konpei walked the streets with wide-eyed wonder, taking in the sights. Of course, he never forgot to look for a job. An innkeeper told him there were always openings for bathhouse attendants, rice-shop clerks, or even bodyguards for gamblers. But Konpei had his pride; though he was a masterless ronin now, until quite recently, he had been a samurai—even if only a minor one with a meager thirty-koku stipend.
In these peaceful times, there was little demand for swordsmen. Day by day, his coin purse grew lighter. He could no longer afford to wander aimlessly as a tourist. Having walked until his legs felt like leaden posts, he finally slumped down, exhausted, beside the Kiyomizu-do temple on the hills of Ueno.
"What a pathetic state I've fallen into," he muttered. As the autumn wind whipped busily through his sleeves and sent the fallen leaves swirling around him, his mind drifted longingly back to his hometown.

The wind was cold, biting at his skin.
*I’ve always been too soft-hearted when it comes to women,* he thought. *But then again, who can ever truly understand a woman's heart?*
The image of a girl named Yukiji flickered behind his eyelids. He found himself reliving the events of that day, a memory as bitter as it was sweet.
Back in Higo-Shinden, Konpei had been a favored attendant to Hosokawa Sakyo, a lord of twenty-five thousand koku. His position naturally brought him into frequent contact with the lady's maids. It had been well and good when his best friend, Naruse Itsuma, fell for the most beautiful of them all—a girl named Yukiji.
"I beg of you! Please, find a way to slip this love letter to Yukiji," Itsuma had pleaded. Unable to refuse his friend, Konpei had accepted the task, though his heart sank. The truth was, Konpei had been secretly in love with Yukiji himself. Unable to say no to a friend, he found himself clutching the small, folded note...

There was no helping it. As everyone knew, Itsuma was far more handsome than he was, and came from a much better family. Konpei figured he should just close his eyes to his own feelings and give up. But just as he was dejectedly retreating through the service entrance, he ran smack into the very girl everyone was talking about: Yukiji. Startled, he moved to step aside, but realizing this was the perfect chance to deliver the letter Itsuma had entrusted to him, his dark face flushed a deep copper red.
"Yuki—Lady Yukiji... Actually, this is, well..."
"Yes? Is there something you need?"
She looked him straight in the face, her round black eyes wide with curiosity. Konpei began to stammer even more. Breaking into a nervous sweat, he thrust out the now-crumpled letter.
"I... I would like you to read this. You see, someone has fallen for you, but... well, he found it too difficult to say it to your face..."
"Oh, Master Konpei! For me?"
In an instant, her face flushed as red as autumn maples. She bowed her head, snatched the letter from his hand, and whispered, "I am so very happy..."
With that, she covered her face with her long sleeves and went running off.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** The page follows the standard layout for popular fiction magazines (like *All Read* or *King*) from the mid-20th century. The title is large and stylized at the top right, followed by the author and illustrator credits. The text is arranged in vertical columns.
*   **Typography:** The title uses a bold, hand-drawn "Edogoji" or "Yose-moji" influenced style, giving it a theatrical, *jidaigeki* (period drama) feel. Furigana (reading aids) are provided for the title's kanji.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the dominant element, followed by the illustration. The illustration (by Suma Toshitaka) depicts a woman in a kimono (presumably Yukiji or the "Nun" of the title) in a classic *bijin-ga* style, which helps establish the romantic and historical tone.
*   **Numbered Sections:** The use of "—１—" indicates this is the beginning of a serialized story or a multi-part short story.
*   **Pagination:** The number "(84)" at the bottom center indicates the page number in the magazine.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The style of writing and the physical layout suggest a post-war publication (late 40s to late 50s). This was a golden age for "pulp" historical fiction in Japan, which provided escapism through tales of samurai, ronin, and romantic intrigue.
*   **Bikuni (比丘尼):** A Buddhist nun. In the Edo period, "Bikuni" sometimes referred to itinerant nuns who performed songs or stories, but in some contexts, it was a euphemism for unlicensed prostitutes (the "Kumano Bikuni"). The title "Bikuni Yashiki" (The Nun's Mansion) suggests a setting of mystery, perhaps involving a secret or forbidden location.
*   **Thirty Koku (三十石):** A "koku" was a unit of rice used to measure a samurai's stipend. Thirty koku was a very low rank—enough to survive, but barely enough to maintain the dignity of a samurai household. It highlights Konpei's humble origins.
*   **Sanjū (三助):** A male bathhouse attendant who would scrub customers' backs and maintain the water. It was considered a low-status, menial job, contrasting sharply with Konpei's former samurai status.
*   **The Misunderstanding (Tsukebumi):** The "Tsukebumi" (love letter) is a classic trope in Japanese literature. The drama here stems from the woman (Yukiji) assuming the letter is from the bearer (Konpei) rather than the sender (Itsuma), creating a romantic triangle/misunderstanding common in *ninjo-bon* (books of human emotion).

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **愛怨 (Aien):** Love and hate; a complex emotional entanglement.
*   **お膝元 (O-hizamoto):** Literally "at the knees." Specifically used to refer to Edo as the seat of the Shogun's power.
*   **浪人 (Ronin):** A masterless samurai.
*   **端くれ (Hashikure):** A scrap, a fragment. Here used self-deprecatingly by Konpei to describe his low rank.
*   **泰平の御代 (Taihei no miyo):** The era of Great Peace, referring to the stable Edo period under the Tokugawa shogunate.
*   **艶文 (Tsuyabumi / Enbun):** A love letter, often written in elegant or flowery language.
*   **へどもど (Hedomodo):** An onomatopoeic expression for being confused, stammering, or acting indecisively.
*   **赤銅色 (Shakudō-iro):** A dark, reddish-brown color (like an alloy of copper and gold). Used here to describe a deep, embarrassed blush on a tan or dark-skinned face.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Class and Pride:** The central conflict in the first section is Konpei’s struggle between his survival (the need for a job) and his samurai pride. He refuses menial jobs because he still views himself as a "warrior."
*   **Unrequited Love & Loyalty:** Konpei's loyalty to his friend Itsuma forces him to suppress his own feelings for Yukiji. This is a classic exploration of *Giri* (social obligation) vs. *Ninjo* (human feeling).
*   **Mistaken Intentions:** The ending of the passage sets up a "comedy of errors" or a tragic misunderstanding. Yukiji’s blush and happiness suggest she believes the letter is from Konpei himself, which will likely lead to complications later in the plot.
*   **Nostalgia:** The transition from the cold, lonely present in Edo to the warm (yet bittersweet) memories of his hometown creates a melancholic tone.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serialized Story, Period Drama (Jidaigeki).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Samurai, Ronin, Romance, Love Letter, Misunderstanding, Edo Period, Social Class, Nostalgia.
*   **Style:** Popular Fiction (Taishū Bungaku).
