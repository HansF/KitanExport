This is an essay/report from a Japanese periodical, likely dating from the late 1940s or early 1950s (the "Pan-pan" and "Rintaku" era of post-war Japan). It describes the grueling life and social observations of a *rintaku* (bicycle taxi) driver.

炎天の中をペダルを踏む苦しさは嫌と言うほど味わったが、寒ければ寒いで、我々の仕事も大変である。手が冷たいとか、耳がちぎれるように痛いとかくらいは、まあ辛抱もしようが、何しろたださえ冬の風がきついのに、幌をつけて走るもんだから、たまったもんじゃない。風上へ向かう時なんかは実際泣きたくなる。いくら尻をトンボのように上げて頑張ったところで、車はガンとして動いてくれない。それに雨の日ときたら慮外なしである（ひどいものである）。

こんな日に限って、利用してくれるお客さんも少ないわけだから休むわけにはいかない。防水布なんてものは、吹き降りにあっては、何の役にも立たないものである。しかしこれも商売だから仕方がないが、空き腹に季節風が遠慮会釈もなしに真っ向から吹きつけてくる黄昏時、一杯機嫌の男が、ふっと酒臭い息を吐いて「おい、リンタク、××まで行け」と乗り込んでくれる時は、ありがたいやら情けないやらで、本当のところ、こんな酔っ払いは、とかく駄賃を弾んでくれるので、嬉しいお客であるが、時によると、大阪中駆け回らして、おまけに途中での関東煮（おでん）や串カツの代金まで立て替えさせた上に「俺は実は金は持ってないんだ」なんてご念の入った奴が現れることがあるから油断も隙もあったもんじゃない。

役人には役徳、特に配給所なんかでは相当の横流し品で儲けるという話だが、我々のようなリンタクの操作員になると、ちゃんと公定があって、文字通り足と脛が資本だから、隠退蔵物資とかボロい役徳なんてあるわけがない。がしかし、そこはまた（チップを）だんまり頂けるから、私達の臨時収入となるわけで、なかなかありがたい。けれどもこれは誰でも彼でもやれるわけではない。やはりその道の穴を掘っている者でないと、おいそれと臨時収入の稼ぎにありつくことは出来ないのである。私は、はばかりながらこのリンタクというものが大阪へ姿を現した一（い）の一番からの古顔だから、京阪神と言えば少々遠くとも「へい、よろしおます」と一走りするわけで、どこか珍しい所がないかと仰るお方に案内する所なら、ちゃんと連絡（コネ）がありますから、その道はその道でぴったりとお好みに適った所へお連れすることが出来る。

最近、料飲禁止後は、酔って駄々をこねるというような方は非常に少なくなりましたが、地方の田舎から出てこられて「面白う遊ぶところ頼みまっせ」と言われることがよくある。初めはリンタクなんてものが物珍しいので、あっちこっち乗り回されるのであろうが、やがて話はそんな所へ落ち着いてくる。そういう田舎出の人で、時勢によって成金になられたお方が引っかかることがある。こんなのは本当に私共の奉る「鴨」で、心斎橋の横丁で関東煮をたらふく食べさせてもらった挙げ句、飛田へしけ込むお供をさせてもらったということもある。そんな時は時間で買い切ってもらうのだから、命の洗濯をしたような気持ちになる。

そんなお客さんが沢山あればホクホクなのだが、私のように案内専門で流し回っている者でも、そんな鴨と言われるのにはなかなか行き当たらない。昔から遊廓や色街を流して歩けば、ボロいお客にありつけるという習慣になっているが、現在のように世の中が混雑してくると、一概にそうした所に限らないところが面白い。リンタクは確かに速度は鈍いという欠点があるが、又反面、どんな細い路地の奥でも、リンリンと走って行けるから便利なものである。だがこのステキな所を見込まれた（後略）。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

In the middle of the scorching sun, the bitterness of stepping on the pedals I have tasted to a disagreeable extent, but if it is cold, it being cold, our work is also difficult. Things like hands being cold or ears being painfully like they are tearing off, well, I shall endure, but anyway, even though the winter wind is harsh just by itself, because [we] run with a hood attached, it is not something that can be borne. When facing upwind, I actually want to cry. No matter how much I raise my rear like a dragonfly and do my best, the vehicle stubbornly does not move for me. And when it comes to rainy days, it is beyond consideration (terrible).

Limited to such days, because the customers who use [us] are also few, I cannot afford to rest. Things like waterproof cloth, in a driving rain, are things that do not serve any use. However, because this is also a business, it cannot be helped, but at the twilight hour when the seasonal wind blows straight from the front without any hesitation or apology against an empty stomach, when a man in high spirits suddenly exhales alcohol-smelling breath and climbs in saying "Hey, Rintaku, go to XX," whether it is thankful or miserable, to tell the truth, such drunks, generally, because they tip generously, are happy customers, but depending on the time, after making me run all over Osaka, and on top of that making me advance the money for Kanto-ni (oden) and kushikatsu on the way, a "well-prepared" fellow who says "Actually, I don't have any money" appears sometimes, so there is no letting one's guard down or having a gap.

For officials there are official perks; especially at distribution centers and the like, there is talk of profiting from considerable black-market goods, but when it comes to being a Rintaku operator like us, there are proper official rates, and literally because legs and shins are the capital, things like hoarded goods or easy perks cannot possibly exist. But, however, there, again, [tips] can be received quietly, so it becomes our temporary income and is quite thankful. However, this is not something that just anyone and everyone can do. As expected, unless it is someone digging a hole in that path (a specialist), one cannot easily come upon the earnings of temporary income. I, though being humble, because I am an old face from the very first moment this thing called Rintaku showed its form in Osaka, if one speaks of Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe, even if it is a little far, with a "Yes, it is good (certainly)," I do a run, and if it is a place to guide a person who says "isn't there somewhere unusual?", because there are proper connections, in that path, for that path, I can take [them] to a place perfectly suited to their preference.

Recently, after the prohibition on food and drink, people who act spoiled while drunk have become very few, but people coming out from the rural countryside often say "I beg you for a place to play interestingly (an entertainment spot)." At first, because the Rintaku itself is a novelty, they are probably driven around here and there, but eventually, the talk settles on that kind of place. Such people from the country, who became nouveau riche due to the times, sometimes get hooked. Such a person is truly a "duck" (mark/sucker) offered up to us; there was a time when, after being treated to a bellyful of Kanto-ni in an alley of Shinsaibashi, I was allowed to accompany [him] as he snuck into Tobita. At such times, because I am bought out by the hour, it feels like I have washed my soul.

If there were many such customers, I would be puffing with joy, but even for someone like me who circles around specializing in guidance, one does not easily encounter what is called such a "duck." From long ago it has been the custom that if one walks drifting through the pleasure quarters or red-light districts, one can come across "easy" customers, but when the world becomes cluttered like it is now, the interesting thing is that it is not necessarily limited to such places. Rintaku certainly has the defect that its speed is slow, but on the other hand, because it can go "rin-rin" (ringing its bell) through the back of any narrow alley, it is a convenient thing. But having this wonderful point recognized (text cuts off).

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

I’ve tasted more than my fair share of the misery of pedaling under a scorching sun, but when the cold sets in, our work becomes a different kind of hell. I can bear my hands freezing or my ears feeling like they’re being torn off, but the real killer is the winter wind. It’s harsh enough on its own, but once you put the hood up on the rickshaw, it catches the air like a sail—facing a headwind, you actually want to burst into tears. No matter how much you stand up on the pedals, rear-end in the air like a dragonfly, the damn thing just won't budge. And don't even get me started on rainy days; they’re simply atrocious.

It’s always on those miserable days that customers are scarcest, which is exactly why I can’t afford to take a day off. Those "waterproof" sheets are useless in a real downpour. Still, it’s a business, so there's no use complaining. Yet, at twilight, when the seasonal winds are slamming into my empty stomach without the slightest mercy, and a man in high spirits exhales a cloud of booze and shouts, "Hey, taxi! Take me to XX!" I don't know whether to feel grateful or pathetic. To be honest, these drunks are usually the best customers because they tend to tip well. But every now and then, you get a real piece of work who makes you haul him all over Osaka, has you pay for his oden and kushikatsu along the way, and then coolly informs you, "Actually, I haven’t got a cent on me." You can't let your guard down for a second.

They say government officials have their perks—especially those at the distribution centers making a killing on black-market goods. But for us *rintaku* drivers, our rates are fixed by the books, and since our only "capital" is our own two legs, there’s no such thing as "hidden assets" or easy graft. However, we do get the occasional tip under the table, which provides a welcome bit of extra income. Of course, not just anyone can pull that off. You have to be a specialist who knows the "ins and outs" of the streets to land those kinds of bonuses. Modesty aside, I’ve been around since the very first *rintaku* appeared on the streets of Osaka. Whether it's Kyoto, Osaka, or Kobe, if a customer asks, I'll say "Sure thing!" and start pedaling. If someone’s looking for a "special" spot, I’ve got the right connections to take them exactly where they want to go.

Since the recent crackdown on drinking and dining, the unruly drunks have mostly disappeared. Nowadays, I often get folks from the countryside asking me to find them "somewhere fun to play." At first, they just want to ride around because the *rintaku* is a novelty to them, but eventually, the conversation always leads to the same kind of place. Occasionally, I'll land a "duck"—some nouveau riche fellow from the country who’s made a fortune off the current state of affairs. One time, a guy treated me to a feast of oden in a Shinsaibashi alley before hiring me to take him down to the Tobita red-light district. Since he paid for my time by the hour, I felt like a new man.

I wish I had customers like that all the time, but even for a veteran guide like me, those "ducks" are few and far between. It used to be that you only found the big spenders in the pleasure quarters, but in today’s chaotic world, the interesting thing is that you can find them just about anywhere. The *rintaku* might be slow, but it has the advantage of being able to ring its bell and navigate even the narrowest back alleys. It was because someone recognized this "wonderful" quality that (text ends)...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography:** The text is arranged in a classic vertical Japanese magazine format. It uses a three-column structure on the bottom half, with the top half featuring a wider column spanning the width of the page.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "街のガイド" (Town Guide) is presented in a stylized, bold, hand-lettered font that gives it a pulp-magazine or tabloid feel. The subtitle "秘 閻魔帖公開" (Secret: Enmachō Disclosure) is even larger and more dramatic, using a brush-stroke style. 
*   **Illustration:** A small line drawing sits between columns, depicting a man and a woman in what appears to be a close, perhaps romantic or illicit, encounter. This reinforces the theme of the "pleasure quarters" mentioned in the text.
*   **Punctuation and Script:** The text uses historical kana orthography (e.g., "いう" written as "いふ", "った" as "つた"). The use of "××" to redact a location name is a common editorial trope in Japanese "street reporting" of this era to maintain a sense of gritty realism while avoiding specific legal trouble.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Rintaku (輪タク):** Short for *rin-takushii* (bicycle taxi). These were extremely popular in post-war Japan (late 1940s) because gasoline was severely rationed or unavailable for civilian use. They were pedaled by men and often featured a carriage for one or two passengers.
*   **Enmachō (閻魔帖):** This refers to the ledger kept by Enma-O (the King of Hell in Buddhist mythology), in which the sins of all mortals are recorded. Using this in the title suggests the article will "reveal the dirty secrets" or "expose the reality" of the city streets.
*   **Post-War Hardship:** The text mentions "empty stomachs" and "seasonal winds," reflecting the poverty and lack of resources in the immediate aftermath of WWII.
*   **Black Market & Corruption:** Mentions of officials profiting from "distribution centers" (配給所) and "hoarded goods" (隠退蔵物資) refer to the rampant black market and corruption that characterized the transition from a command economy to a free market during the Allied Occupation.
*   **Tobita (飛田):** Refers to Tobita Shinchi in Osaka, one of the most famous red-light districts in Japan.
*   **Nouveau Riche (成金 - Narikin):** The term "諸成金" (various nouveau riche) refers to people who made quick fortunes through black marketeering or land speculation during the chaotic post-war recovery.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **慮外なし (Ryogai-nashi):** An archaic or dialectal way to say "out of the question," "terrible," or "unbearable." 
*   **一杯機嫌 (Ippai kigen):** A state of being pleasantly tipsy or in high spirits from drinking.
*   **関東煮 (Kantō-ni):** The Kansai (Osaka region) term for *Oden*.
*   **役徳 (Yakitoku):** Perks of the job; often used with a cynical nuance of "illicit benefits."
*   **鴨 (Kamo):** Literally "duck." In Japanese slang, this means an easy target, a sucker, or a "mark" who is easily parted from his money.
*   **命の洗濯 (Inochi no sentaku):** Literally "washing one's life." An idiom meaning to take a break, enjoy oneself, or feel refreshed after a period of hard work.
*   **古顔 (Furugao):** An "old face" or a veteran in a particular field/place.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Social Stratification:** The text highlights the gap between the struggling laborer (the driver) and the corrupt officials or the "nouveau riche" who spend money in red-light districts.
*   **Street-Level Wisdom:** The narrator takes pride in being a "specialist" and having "connections." This reflects the importance of informal networks in post-war survival.
*   **The "Underworld" Economy:** The Rintaku driver is portrayed not just as transportation, but as a gateway to illicit or hidden pleasures (guiding people to "fun places").
*   **Cynicism vs. Resilience:** There is a strong undercurrent of weariness and cynicism regarding the "system" (officials, drunks who don't pay), but also a gritty resilience and a sense of humor about the "duck" customers.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay, First-person Reportage, Social Commentary.
