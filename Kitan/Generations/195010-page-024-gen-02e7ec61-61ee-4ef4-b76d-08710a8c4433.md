## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

と宙吊りになった身体を揺って喚いた。あきは落着いていた。
「もう遅いさ、ちょいと黒百合園の処刑の味も覚えときなよ」
悠々真弓の眼の前で二、三度振ると、ピシッと真弓の白い頰に当てた。
「あれー」
と悲鳴を上げて泣き出したのを耳にも入らぬ風で、更に二つ三つとぶった真弓の頰は、その度にバンドの型のままの赤い跡が残り、みるみる腫れた。
「どう、少しはこたえた？」
ひざがあき真弓の顔を覗き込んだ。
「堪忍してよ、どんなことでもして謝るわ」
と真弓は繰返した。
「こんなこと先生や親達に話すと、私達もつともつとひどい復讐してよ、わかった」
と脅し、縄を解いた。
真弓は醜く腫れ上つた頰を涙で濡らして帰り、次の日から暫く学校も休んでいたが、どう言いつくろったのか、あき達のことは洩れなかった。
これをいいことにしてあき達の暴力は次々と犠牲者を求めて拡がつた。が然しあき達の悪どい遊びに似た行動は直接身に受けた者以外は誰も知らなかった。隠おとめ心に受けた衝動が却つてそれを隠させたのか、復讐の言葉におののいたのか、黒百合園の噂はちらと学校の中には流れたが、そのような暴力沙汰に及んでいることは噂の中には無かった。学校当局も黒百合園の噂をとり上げて、職員会議の席上にも出されたが、てんで相手にならぬ教師もいたし、単に子供らしい何かとがごっこの名前だろう、と問題にはならなかった。校長自体が「何でも悪いことなら一人前に真似て見たがる年頃であ」と、強い眼鏡をすり上げ乍ら結論した。
そうしている中に、あき達はそんな平凡な私刑にも飽いて来ていた。つまらない、と言う者もいて、もっと強い刺激を求めたいと言い出し始めた。メンバー達はいろんな方法を授業中と言わず、家へ帰ってからと言わず、頭をひねつた。彼女等自身がどきまぎするような強烈な刺激を感ずる私刑の方法は、と一心に相談した。
「裸にしたらきっと面白いわよ」
と流石口にしにくいことを近子が口火を切った。
「女つてものは何より裸にされることが一番こたえるものよ、羞恥を與えるのさ。それが女の致命傷さ」
これが可愛くあるべき女学生の言うことかと思うことを平気で言うのだった。
「そりや面白いわよ」
賛成する者が出て女らしい猥談に花が咲くと、満足したように別れる日常であった。
その頃になると、あきの顔には子供らしい影はすっかり消えて、一目見てぞつとするような残忍なそして淫蕩な色が刻み込まれていた。目の光は渇れて、脂切つた身体は思わず男の目をそむけさせるような肉情的な姿態にさえなっていた。もう一人前の成熟した女であった。
避暑の砦で酔った男に誘いかけられると、意のままに従った。地廻りの若い男に泊り込まれると、その男にも身体をあずけた。がそんなあきには尚他の人の幸福を嫉む癖はとれなかった。自分は常に不幸であるという先入観念がどうしてもあきを満足させて呉れなかつた。彼女の精神はすっかり分裂作用を起していたのだ。そんな自分が風紀是正の旗印をかかげているという矛盾については、考えて見たこともなかった。もう考えるだけの良心も無くその必要もなかった。彼女はただ自分のサディズムを満足させれば足る。一ケの呪わるべき存在でしかなかつた。
ある日、瀧枝が一つの情報を持って来た。それは隣の縣立女學校の生徒が男の学生と一緒に公園の草叢にねていた現場を見つけたというのだった。然もその女学生の名前までちゃんと調べ上げて周到なものであった。何処の生徒だつていい、学生の辱に、と一緒に憤慨し、日本の女学生全体の面子にかけて、と大きくいいきいた。
血に飢えた狼が獲物を待つように、あくる日、瀧枝は早速その女学校の校門の前迄出向いて行つた。彼女らの言葉によれば、所謂「よび出し」をかけに行ったのである。
場所は何時もの裏であつた。あき達はそこで、瀧枝がその女学生を連れ込んで来るのを待つていた。二階の天井には鼠が大きな音を立てて走り、部屋の隅々には腐れ果てた藁、パだの大根などが捨ててあつた。
二時間程経つと、どう言いくるめて来たのか、瀧枝が一人の女学生を待つて来た。潔い健康そうな顔色の女で、滑らかな肌が首から襟元へかけて目立つていた。瀧枝は、
「これが昨日の深井美代よ」
と背を思いきり突いた。不意を襲われた型で美代はよろよろと部屋の中へ入つたが、初めて直感的に身の危険を感じたものか身を翻して逃げ出そうとしたが、二度瀧枝につき飛ばされるとへな／＼と其処へ坐り込んだ。
「黒百合園がお前さんの来るのを待つてたんだ」
小夜が芝居の台詞もどきに凄味を利かせて言うと、美代は瞬間さつと顔色を失つた。
「わたしに何の用があるの？」
と言つて声は幾分ふるえていた。すかさず瀧枝は言つた。
「昨日公園の草の中で一体何してたのよ、ちゃんとわたいが現場を見たんだよ」
「何もしなかつたのよ、たゞねころんでいただけでよ」
「白々しいことを言うのね、だけど何はともあれあんなことは女学生の身分でいゝと思つてるの？」
「だつてあんた達に関係したことじやないわ」
「何さ生意気な、黒百合園が怖くないのかい？」
瀧枝はいら／＼として言つたがあきはそれを止めて口を開いた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(The character) swayed the body that had become suspended in mid-air and wailed. Aki was calm.
"It is already late, try remembering a bit the taste of the Black Lily Garden's execution."
After leisurely swinging (it) two or three times in front of Mayumi’s eyes, with a 'pishi' sound, (she) hit Mayumi’s white cheek.
"Aah—"
With an air of not even letting the scream and the start of crying enter her ears, (she) struck two or three more times; Mayumi’s cheeks, each time, left a red mark in the shape of the band, and visibly swelled.
"How is it, did it tell a bit?"
Aki peered into Mayumi’s face.
"Forgive me, I will do anything and apologize,"
Mayumi repeated.
"If you talk about such things to teachers or parents, we will do more and more terrible revenge, understood?"
(She) threatened and untied the rope.
Mayumi, wetting her ugly-swollen cheeks with tears, went home; from the next day (she) rested from school for a while, but however she smoothed it over, things about Aki and the others did not leak out.
Taking advantage of this, Aki and the others' violence sought victims one after another and expanded. However, Aki and the others' actions resembling wicked play were known by no one except those who directly received it on their bodies. Whether the shock received in a maidenly heart conversely made them hide it, or whether they trembled at the words of revenge, rumors of the Black Lily Garden flowed slightly inside the school, but the fact that it reached such violent affairs was not in the rumors. School authorities also took up the rumors of the Black Lily Garden, and it was brought to the floor of the staff meeting, but there were teachers who did not take it as an opponent at all, and concluding that it was probably just a name for something childlike like playing house, it did not become a problem. The principal himself, while sliding up strong glasses, concluded, "It is the age where they want to imitate anything if it is a bad thing."
While doing so, Aki and the others were becoming bored with such mundane private punishments. There were those who said "it’s boring," and they began to say they wanted to seek stronger stimulation. The members, whether during class or after returning home, racked their brains. They consulted single-mindedly on a method of private punishment where they themselves would feel a dizzying, intense stimulation.
"If we make them naked, it will surely be interesting,"
Chikako, as expected, broke the ice on something difficult to say.
"For a woman, being made naked is what tells more than anything; it is giving shame. That is a woman's fatal wound."
She said things that made one think, "Is this what a schoolgirl who should be cute would say?" without concern.
"That is interesting."
As supporters appeared and talk like feminine lewd chatter bloomed, it was a daily life of parting as if satisfied.
By that time, from Aki’s face, childlike shadows had completely vanished, and at a glance, cruel and lewd colors that made one shudder were carved in. The light of her eyes was withered, and her grease-covered body had even become a carnal posture that made men unintentionally avert their eyes. She was already a full-fledged, mature woman.
When invited by a drunken man at a summer resort fortress, she followed as he wished. When a young local thug stayed over, she entrusted her body to that man too. But for such an Aki, the habit of envying others' happiness did not leave. The preconceived notion that she was always unhappy somehow would not let Aki be satisfied. Her spirit was undergoing a complete splitting action. Regarding the contradiction that she herself was raising the banner of correcting public morals, she had never even tried to think. She no longer had the conscience to think, nor the necessity. She only needed to satisfy her own sadism. She was nothing but a cursed existence.
One day, Takie brought a piece of information. It was that she found a student of the neighboring prefectural girls' high school sleeping in the grass of a park together with a male student. Moreover, she had thoroughly investigated even that schoolgirl's name. "It doesn't matter what school she's from, it's a disgrace to students," they were indignant together, and "for the honor of Japanese schoolgirls as a whole," (she) stated grandly.
Like a blood-hungry wolf waiting for prey, the next day, Takie promptly went out to the front of that girls' school gate. According to their words, she went to perform a so-called "calling out."
The place was the usual back-alley. Aki and the others were there, waiting for Takie to bring that schoolgirl in. On the ceiling of the second floor, rats ran making loud noises, and in the corners of the room, rotten straw, rubbish, and radishes were thrown away.
After about two hours passed, having somehow talked her way through, Takie came bringing one schoolgirl. A woman with a white, healthy-looking complexion, her smooth skin stood out from her neck to her collar. Takie,
"This is yesterday's Miyoko Fukai,"
pushed her back with all her might. Taken by surprise, Miyoko entered the room tottering, but perhaps feeling an instinctive sense of danger for the first time, she tried to turn and escape, but being pushed down twice by Takie, she sat down limply on that spot.
"The Black Lily Garden has been waiting for your arrival."
When Sayo said with a theatrical, threatening tone, Miyoko instantly lost her color.
"What business do you have with me?"
(She) said, and her voice was somewhat trembling. Immediately, Takie said,
"What on earth were you doing in the grass of the park yesterday? I properly saw the scene."
"I didn't do anything, I was just lying down."
"You say such innocent-sounding things. But regardless, do you think such a thing is okay for the status of a schoolgirl?"
"But, it’s not something related to you all."
"What, you saucy girl, are you not afraid of the Black Lily Garden?"
Takie said irritably, but Aki stopped her and opened her mouth.

Aki watched, unmoved, as the girl swayed like a pendulum from the ceiling, her cries filling the room. 
"Too late now," Aki said coolly. "You're about to get a taste of how the 'Black Lily Garden' handles an execution."
She toyed with the belt, swinging it casually before Mayumi’s eyes a few times before suddenly snapping it against her pale cheek.
"Ah!"
Ignoring the girl’s sobbing plea, Aki struck her again and again. Each blow left a jagged red welt in the shape of the buckle, and Mayumi’s face began to swell hideously before their eyes.
"Well? Feeling it yet?" Aki sneered, leaning in close.
"Please, stop... I'll do anything, I'll apologize..." Mayumi whimpered.
"If you breathe a word of this to your parents or the teachers, the next revenge will be ten times worse. Got it?" Aki threatened as she finally undid the ropes.

Mayumi returned home, her face a bruised, tear-stained mess. She skipped school for a few days, but through some clever lie or another, she never mentioned Aki’s name. Emboldened by this silence, the Black Lily Garden’s reign of terror spread, seeking out one victim after another. Yet, because of the victims' deep-seated shame or their paralyzing fear of retaliation, their "wicked games" remained a dark secret. Rumors of the group flickered through the school hallways, but the true extent of their violence never reached the surface. Even when the faculty discussed the rumors, some teachers dismissed them as childish nonsense—a mere "club" with a dramatic name. The principal himself, adjusting his thick glasses, waved it off. "It’s just that age," he concluded. "Girls that age love to play-act at being rebels."

Eventually, even these "mundane" punishments began to bore them. They craved a stronger high. During class and at home, the members racked their brains for a new thrill—something that would make even their own hearts race.
"Strip them. That'll be fun," Chikako suggested, finally voicing the thought the others had hesitated to speak. "For a woman, nothing cuts deeper than being made naked. It's the ultimate humiliation. That’s her fatal flaw."
It was a chilling sentiment, spoken with total nonchalance by a girl who was supposed to be a "wholesome" student.
"Now that sounds interesting," the others agreed. Their daily meetings devolved into crude, erotic fantasies, and they left feeling a dark sense of satisfaction.

By then, every trace of childhood innocence had vanished from Aki’s face. In its place was something that made the skin crawl—a look of deep-seated cruelty and decadence. Her eyes were hollow, and her body, though still young, had taken on a heavy, carnal ripeness that made men turn away in a mix of desire and revulsion. She had become a woman, fully matured in the worst possible way.
At a summer resort, she had given herself to a drunken stranger. Later, she lived with a local thug, surrendering her body to him without a second thought. Yet, she could never rid herself of her poisonous envy for the happiness of others. Haunted by the conviction that she was destined for misery, she could find no peace. Her mind was fracturing. She never once saw the irony in the fact that she was leading a crusade for "moral reform." She no longer had a conscience, nor did she need one. She lived only to feed her own sadism—a truly cursed soul.

One day, Takie arrived with news. She had caught a student from the neighboring prefectural girls' high school lying in the grass with a boy. She had even tracked down the girl’s name. "I don't care where she's from, she's a disgrace to all students!" Takie fumed, claiming they had to act for the "honor of Japanese schoolgirls."
Like wolves scenting blood, they moved the next day. Takie went to the school gates to "call out" the girl.
They met at their usual hideout—a derelict back room where rats scurried across the ceiling and the corners were filled with rotting straw and refuse. Two hours later, Takie arrived with the girl in tow. She was a healthy-looking girl named Miyoko Fukai, her skin pale and smooth.
Takie shoved her into the room. "Here she is. Miyoko Fukai."
Terrified and confused, Miyoko tried to bolt, but Takie slammed her back down. She collapsed onto the floor, trembling.
"The Black Lily Garden has been waiting for you," Sayo said, her voice dripping with theatrical menace.
Miyoko turned pale. "What... what do you want with me?" she stammered.
"What were you doing in the park yesterday?" Takie demanded. "I saw you."
"We weren't doing anything! We were just lying there!"
"Save the act. Do you really think that's appropriate for a girl of your standing?"
"It's none of your business!" Miyoko snapped back, a flash of spirit remaining.
"You little brat," Takie spat, her temper rising. "Do you have any idea who you're talking to?"
Just as Takie was about to strike, Aki stepped forward to speak.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The text is presented in a vertical orientation (*tategaki*), standard for Japanese literature. It is organized into multiple columns, typical of a magazine or a small-format "bunko" book.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style, common for mid-century printing. There are specific emphasis marks (*bouten* or *shimeji*) placed to the right of certain characters to denote vocal stress or importance (e.g., around "裸にしたら" and "黒百合園").
*   **Punctuation:** It uses modern punctuation (brackets for dialogue, commas, and periods), but the use of "—" for long vowels in screams ("あれー") and the specific way "へな／＼" (henah-hena) is written with a repetition mark suggests an older typesetting style.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "(24)" is centered at the bottom. The text is dense with little white space, implying a "shosetsu" (novel) format meant for continuous reading.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s–1950s):** The content and language strongly suggest the "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine era of post-WWII Japan. This period saw a surge in sensationalist literature involving "pan-pan" girls (prostitutes), juvenile delinquents (*furyo*), and a general anxiety about the breakdown of traditional morals.
*   **Black Lily Garden (Kuroyurigaren):** While likely a fictional gang name, "Black Lily" evokes a sense of "dark beauty" or "femme fatale" aesthetics common in *shojo* (girls') fiction of the era, subverted here into a violent gang.
*   **Moral Panics:** The text reflects the social obsession with "pure" schoolgirls (*jogakusei*) and the fear of their corruption by Western influence or post-war nihilism. The hypocrisy of the protagonist (Aki), who is promiscuous herself but punishes others for "immorality," is a central psychological theme.
*   **Private Punishment (*Shikei*):** Vigilante justice or "lynching" in schools was a recurring trope in post-war juvenile drama, representing the failure of official authority (the principal and teachers) to maintain order.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **私刑 (Shikei):** Usually means "lynching," but in this context, it refers to extrajudicial or "private" punishment/bullying by a gang.
*   **淫蕩 (Intou):** A strong word meaning lewd, dissolute, or debauched. It is used here to describe the protagonist's moral and physical decay.
*   **地廻り (Jimawari):** A term for a local hoodlum, thug, or low-level gangster who "hangs around" a specific neighborhood.
*   **呼び出し (Yobidashi):** A "calling out." In the context of school bullying or gangs, it refers to summoning a victim to a secluded place for confrontation or punishment.
*   **猥談 (Waidan):** Dirty talk or lewd conversation. The fact that schoolgirls are engaging in this is used to highlight their loss of "innocence."
*   **肉情的 (Nikujouteki):** Carnal, sensual, or voluptuous.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Corruption of Innocence:** The primary theme is the transformation of "cute schoolgirls" into "blood-hungry wolves." The text focuses on the physical manifestation of sin (the "lewd colors" on Aki's face).
*   **Sadism and Voyeurism:** The narrative dwells on the details of physical punishment (the belt marks) and the threat of public stripping, catering to a voyeuristic, adult male readership common for pulp magazines.
*   **The Failure of Authority:** The teachers and principal are depicted as incompetent, dismissive, or oblivious, which allows the "Black Lily Garden" to operate with impunity.
*   **Hypocrisy as a Character Flaw:** Aki’s character is defined by the contradiction between her own "degenerate" behavior and her "crusade" to punish other girls for minor moral infractions. This suggests a theme of psychological projection and displaced self-hatred.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Novel, Sensationalist Drama.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Delinquency, Schoolgirls, Violence, Sadism, Post-war Japan, Moral Decay, Revenge, Misogyny/Sensationalism.
