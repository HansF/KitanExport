話実　罪犯
**色情地獄**　京町 進　説
（さゆみと　六助）

「てめえは何んだッ」
「貴様がさゆみの情夫か、俺は五年前ちよつとした用事で、別荘入りをしていたさゆみの亭主だ」
「えッ」
「長い間、世話になつたな、禮を言うぜ」
その言葉の終らぬうちに六助は金次の顎をつき上げていた。
「出てうせろ」
よろめく金次の股の間を蹴り上げて突きとばした。金次はどさりと土間へひっくり返り下腹を抑えて苦悶するが起き上る力がない。さゆみはその間に子供を抱えて表へ逃げ出した。
「やいッ、逃げるつもりか」
六助は人垣を押しのけて、その後を追う。引裂けたシミーズ一枚で、顔中血だらけにして逃げるさゆみ。
その時、走りゆくさゆみの彼方に制服の警官の姿をちらりと見た六助は、あわてて横町へ飛び込んだ。

六助はすつかり暮れきつた大蔵海岸に悄然と突立つていた。有金全部をはたいて、カストリ屋で引っ掛けた何杯かの焼酎が、久しく酒に接しなかつた彼の五体にしみわたり、涼しい夏の夜の風はホテル頬を快く撫でる。だが六助の胸の中は、凄まじく煮えくり返つていた。
「畜生、眞面目になつてやろうと思つて出て来たのに、この現実は何んとした事だろう。道義も糞もあるもんか、女という女に復讐してやる」
心の中でそうつぶやいた。
続いて打ち上げられる花火が、月のない夜空に虹を描いた。夕涼みがてらに島祭りの夜の行事である阿波と淡路の花火大会を見物に来た老若男女は、それぞれ喚声を上げながら、渚から公園にかけて、右往左往している。
六助はふら／＼と歩いた。人々から離れた松の木蔭に、二人の女が立つているのを見た彼の血は燃え立つた。
背後から女の側へ近づいて行つた。二人共若い娘らしなかつた。背後からニユッと現れた六助にびつくりして、
「あッ」と叫んで二人は飛びのこうとしたが、六助は小さい方の娘の手をつちりと掴んだ。
「あなたは、どなたです、あたしをどうしようと言うんですの？」
もがく、女の顔をパシツとなぐり倒しておいて、六助は逃げようとする大きい方の娘に飛びついた。
「おい、聲を出すと命がないぜ」
六助は女をおどしておいて、す早く倒れた娘のスカートの裾を引きちぎり娘の口へ落し込んだんだ。
全く瞬間の出来事で、女は助けを呼ぶひまもなかつたし、よしんば叫んだ所で、わい／＼騒いでいる人々の耳へ入る筈がなかつた。
六助は松の根元に氣絶している娘には目もくれず、大きい方の娘を引きずるようにして背後の山へ連れ込んだ。娘は必死に抵抗したが、屈強の男の前には、どうする事も出来なかつた。
「此処なら大丈夫だ、誰も来やしないぜ」
山の中腹迄来ると、六助は安心したように、娘の猿ぐつわを外した。
「悪魔、畜生ッ」
「悪魔か、希望を失った人間は、悪魔より恐ろしいかも知れんな」
六助は毒々しくそう投げつけると、つと、女を抱き上げた。

翌日、三つの事件が街を騒がせた一一つは、ズロース一枚の少女が岬で投身自殺したこと、一つは父と長女の直子が自宅で虐殺され、さゆみが顔面三ケ所の重傷を負つたこと、今一つは刑期を終えて仮出獄した六助が、行方不明になつたことである。
所轄洲本警察署では、この淡路島から、本州、四國へ連絡する港々へ、急手配をしたが、六助は島外へ逃げのびた気配はなかつた。
島祭りの最後の夜。市内二ケ所に於て美貌の少女が暗闇を通行中、いきなり躍り出した怪漢のために頬の肉をえぐり取られた。
そしてその翌朝、川口に三十歳前後の男と二十過ぎの女の抱合心死体が発見された。それは六助と、島祭りにミス淡路として、第一位を獲得したキャバレー・バリーの人気女給岡崎しの子の二人であつた。
しの子は一年前、淡路へ流れて来た四國の女で、朋友の話では六助を知る筈はなかつたとのこと事であつた。

True Story Crime
**Lustful Hell**  Susumu Kyomachi, Story
(Sayumi and Rokunosuke)

"You, what are you!?"
"You are Sayumi's lover? I am Sayumi's husband, who was entering the villa (prison) for a small matter five years ago."
"Eh!"
"For a long time, you took care of things, I say thanks."
Before those words finished, Rokunosuke was thrusting up Kinji's jaw.
"Get out and vanish."
He kicked up between the staggering Kinji's legs and pushed him away. Kinji fell with a thud onto the dirt floor, holding his lower abdomen in agony, but had no strength to get up. Sayumi, in that interval, grabbed the child and fled outside.
"Hey! You think you can run?"
Rokunosuke pushed through the crowd of people and pursued after her. Wearing only a torn chemise, Sayumi fled with her face covered in blood.
At that time, catching a glimpse of a uniformed policeman in the distance where Sayumi was running, Rokunosuke hurriedly dove into a side street.

Rokunosuke stood dejectedly at Okura Coast, where it had completely grown dark. Having spent all his money, the several cups of shochu he knocked back at a *kasutori* shop permeated his entire body, which hadn't touched alcohol for a long time, and the cool summer night wind pleasantly stroked his burning cheeks. But inside Rokunosuke's chest, things were boiling terribly.
"Damn it, though I came out thinking I'd become serious (honest), what is this reality. Morals be damned, I will take revenge on every woman."
He muttered such in his heart.
Following that, launched fireworks drew a rainbow in the moonless night sky. Men and women, young and old, who came to see the Awa and Awaji fireworks festival, which is a night event of the Island Festival while enjoying the evening cool, are moving to and fro from the beach to the park while raising cheers.
Rokunosuke walked unsteadily. His blood burned when he saw two women standing in the shade of a pine tree away from the people.
He approached the women's side from behind. Both seemed like young girls. Surprised by Rokunosuke who appeared suddenly from behind,
"Ah!" they screamed and tried to jump away, but Rokunosuke firmly grabbed the smaller girl's hand.
"Who are you? What do you intend to do with me?"
After punching down the struggling woman's face, Rokunosuke jumped on the larger girl who was trying to escape.
"Hey, if you make a sound, there's no life (you're dead)."
Rokunosuke threatened the woman, quickly tore off the hem of the fallen girl's skirt, and stuffed it into the girl's mouth.
It was a completely instantaneous event; the woman had no time to call for help, and even if she had screamed, there was no way it would reach the ears of the people making a fuss.
Rokunosuke gave no look to the girl fainting at the base of the pine tree and dragged the larger girl into the mountain behind. The girl resisted desperately, but before a sturdy man, she could do nothing.
"Here is safe, no one will come."
Coming to the mountainside, Rokunosuke, as if relieved, removed the girl's gag.
"Demon! Beast!"
"A demon, eh? A human who has lost hope might be scarier than a demon."
When Rokunosuke threw those venomous words, he suddenly picked the woman up.

The next day, three incidents stirred the town. One was a girl in only bloomers committing suicide by jumping from a cape; one was the father and eldest daughter Naoko being slaughtered at home, and Sayumi suffering serious injuries in three places on her face; another was Rokunosuke, who had been released on parole after finishing his term, becoming missing.
At the local Sumoto Police Station, they made urgent arrangements at the ports connecting this Awaji Island to Honshu and Shikoku, but there was no sign that Rokunosuke had escaped off the island.
The final night of the Island Festival. In two places in the city, while beautiful girls were passing through the darkness, their cheek flesh was gouged out by a strange man who suddenly jumped out.
And the next morning, the double suicide bodies of a man around thirty and a woman over twenty were discovered at the river mouth. It was the two: Rokunosuke and Okazaki Shinoko, a popular waitress at Cabaret Barry who had won first place as Miss Awaji at the Island Festival.
Shinoko was a Shikoku woman who had drifted to Awaji one year ago, and according to a friend's story, there was no reason she should have known Rokunosuke.

**True Crime Records**
**Lustful Hell** by Susumu Kyomachi
(The Tale of Sayumi and Rokunosuke)

"Who the hell are you!?"
"So, you’re Sayumi’s lover? I’m her husband. I’ve been away at the 'villa' for the last five years on a bit of business."
"What—!?"
"You’ve been a big help while I was gone. Allow me to thank you."
Before the words were out of his mouth, Rokunosuke’s fist slammed into Kinji’s jaw. 
"Get lost!"
He delivered a brutal kick between the staggering man’s legs, sending him flying. Kinji hit the dirt floor with a heavy thud, clutching his groin in agony, unable to stand. In the chaos, Sayumi snatched up the child and bolted for the door.
"Hey! You think you're getting away?"
Rokunosuke shoved through the gathering crowd to give chase. Sayumi ran for her life, her chemise torn and her face a mask of blood.
Just then, Rokunosuke spotted the silhouette of a uniformed policeman in the distance. He veered sharply, disappearing into a narrow side alley.

Later, Rokunosuke stood alone on the darkening sands of Okura Coast. He had blown his last cent at a *kasutori* dive; the cheap, harsh shochu burned through a body that hadn't tasted liquor in years. A cool summer breeze brushed against his flushed cheeks, but his heart was a cauldron of rage.
"Damn it all," he spat. "I came out of that place wanting to go straight, and this is what I find? To hell with morality. I’ll have my revenge on every last woman."
The thought festered in his mind.
Above him, fireworks streaked across the moonless sky, painting rainbows against the black. It was the night of the Awa-Awaji Festival, and the shores were packed with revelers of all ages, their cheers echoing from the beach to the park.
Rokunosuke stumbled along, drunk and untethered. His blood surged when he spotted two figures standing in the shadow of a pine tree, far from the crowds.
He crept up behind them. They were both young women. As he loomed over them, they gasped in terror.
"Ah!" they cried, trying to bolt, but Rokunosuke’s grip clamped onto the smaller girl’s wrist like a vise.
"Who are you? What are you doing!?"
He silenced her with a sharp blow to the face, then lunged for the older girl before she could flee.
"Keep quiet if you want to live," he hissed.
He pinned her down and shredded a piece of the fallen girl’s skirt, stuffing it into her mouth as a gag.
It happened in a heartbeat. There was no time to scream, and even if they had, their voices would have been swallowed by the roar of the festival.
Ignoring the girl unconscious at the foot of the tree, Rokunosuke dragged the older one up into the mountains. She fought with everything she had, but she was no match for his brute strength.
"We’re safe here. No one’s coming," he said once they reached the mountainside. He pulled the gag from her mouth, his breath heavy.
"You demon! You beast!" she cried.
"A demon, am I? A man who’s lost all hope is far more terrifying than any demon."
With a venomous sneer, he swept her into his arms.

The following day, the town was rocked by three chilling reports. First, the body of a young girl in nothing but her underwear was found at the base of a cliff—a suicide. Second, a man and his eldest daughter, Naoko, had been found slaughtered in their home, while Sayumi lay in critical condition with three deep gashes across her face. Finally, it was reported that Rokunosuke, recently out on parole, had vanished.
The Sumoto Police cordoned off the ports to Honshu and Shikoku, but there was no sign he had left the island.
On the final night of the festival, the horror continued. Two beautiful young women were attacked in the dark; a shadow had leapt from the brush and gouged the flesh from their cheeks.
The next morning, the search ended. At the mouth of the river, the bodies of a man in his thirties and a woman in her twenties were found locked in a death embrace. They were identified as Rokunosuke and Okazaki Shinoko, the star waitress of Cabaret Barry and the reigning "Miss Awaji."
Shinoko had arrived from Shikoku only a year prior. According to those who knew her, she had no connection to Rokunosuke—and no reason to die by his side.
—The End—

    *   The title "**犯罪実話**" (True Crime Story) is written in a stylized, bold font at the top right, reading right-to-left. 
    *   The subtitle "**色情地獄**" (Lustful Hell) is larger and more decorative, emphasizing the sensationalist nature of the content.
    *   Body text is a standard serif font common in mid-20th-century printing.
*   **Visual Elements:** An illustration dominates the center-right. It depicts a dramatic, violent scene: a man (Rokunosuke) aggressively grabbing a woman (Sayumi or one of the victims), emphasizing the "pulp" and "noir" aesthetic of the era. The lines are rough and expressive, conveying movement and terror.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-War 1940s-1950s):** This text belongs to the "Kasutori" magazine genre—cheap, sensationalist publications that flourished in Japan shortly after WWII. They focused on "3S" (Sex, Screen, Sports) and often featured grim, violent, or eroticized "true" crime stories.
*   **"Bessou-iri" (別荘入り):** Literally "entering the villa." This was a common post-war slang term (euphemism) for going to prison.
*   **Kasutori-ya (カストリ屋):** These were low-end drinking establishments that served *kasutori* shochu, a harsh, often poorly distilled alcohol. The term "Kasutori magazine" comes from the idea that these magazines, like the liquor, would make you "sick" after three issues.
*   **Setting (Awaji Island/Akashi):** The story mentions "Okura Coast" (in Akashi) and "Sumoto" (on Awaji Island). The "Island Festival" and "Awa-Awaji Fireworks" refer to regional summer traditions that provide a stark, festive contrast to the grim crimes.
*   **Post-War Social Issues:** The story touches on the nihilism of returning veterans or ex-convicts who find their homes destroyed or their wives with other men—a common social trope in "Pan-pan" girl and "Kasutori" literature.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **情夫 (Joufu):** An older term for a male lover or paramour, often used with a negative connotation (an illicit lover).
*   **土間 (Doma):** The traditional Japanese dirt-floor entrance area inside a house where shoes are removed.
*   **シミーズ (Shimizu):** From the French "chemise." A common undergarment for women in the mid-20th century.
*   **悄然 (Shozen):** Dejectedly, discouraged.
*   **五体 (Gotai):** The five parts of the body (head, both arms, both legs); essentially, one's whole being.
*   **心死 (Shinshi):** An older or variant term for *Shinju* (double suicide), specifically "heart death" or dying together by choice.
*   **女給 (Jokyu):** A waitress, specifically one at a cafe or cabaret who might also entertain guests, a precursor to modern hostesses.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Misogyny and Revenge:** The protagonist, Rokunosuke, explicitly blames "women as a whole" for his personal betrayal, leading to a spree of gender-based violence. This reflects a dark current of post-war male resentment.
*   **Nihilism (Kyodatsu):** Rokunosuke's dialogue about a hopeless man being scarier than a demon encapsulates the *kyodatsu* (state of lethargy/despair) condition of early post-war Japan.
*   **Contrast of Light and Dark:** The use of the fireworks festival as a backdrop for kidnapping and assault creates a "noir" juxtaposition between public celebration and private horror.
*   **The "Sensational" Lie:** Though framed as a "True Crime Story" (犯罪実話), these pieces were often heavily fictionalized or entirely invented to titillate readers with "erotic-grotesque-nonsense" (ero-guro-nansensu).

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Noir, Kasutori Literature.
*   **Primary Tags:** Crime, Revenge, Misogyny, Post-war Japan, Eroticism, Violence, Sensationalism.
