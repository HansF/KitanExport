### 女性の悲鳴について

自動車会社の社長さんが盲腸炎で入院した時、看護したこともあります。その芸者さんは一等の花柳界でも売っ妓で、年齢も二十六、七から三十に近く（芸者さんは年齢を正確に発表しませんから見当がつかないそうです）で、俗に脂肪の乗り切った大年増でございます。見るからに男好みのする太り肉のヒップが何と言っても売っ妓の原因だったそうなのでしたが、その臓腑に麻酔を施したのでございます。普段、お酒好きの芸者さんには効くはずがなく、仕方なく外科医は局所麻酔で切開して行ったのでございました。

少し撓っても痛い腹部の筋肉でございますから、耐えきったものではありません。手足を縛ったバンドが引きちぎれんばかりの暴れまわりでございます。あのお澄まし屋で、旦那の前では口を噤んで、ひそひそ笑う芸者さんがどう思うと、その露わもない泣きようはいかがと申したいか。「AA 痛ッ…痛ッ…痛ッ…痛った」「H 痛ッ…痛ッ…HH―ツ」『動ける有名な美人芸者が開腹手術で入院いたしました。看護婦さんはその芸者の旦那と云う某自動ツ、H―ツ、HH―ツ』『助けてエ…助けてもらう…』と子音も母音もなく「痛ッ」と叫んで「して」「よさないか芸者さんを」と怒号し、外科医を蹴りたもうてございます。それでメスの手を緩めない外科医の冷静さに、嘲る気力も失い、最後にばかり助けられて「痛いッ」と微かに泣き声を上げて涙をポロポロこぼしていたそうでございます。

ですから美的要素などございません。私もお恥ずかしい話でございます。小児科、骨髄の手術で泣き叫び付き添いの母親を手こずらせた女医の肉団だったそうでしたが、その臓腑に麻酔を施したのでございます。普段、お酒好きの芸者さんには効くはずがなく、仕方なく外科医は局所麻酔で切開して行ったのでございました。

### Concerning the Screams of Women

When the president of a car company was hospitalized for appendicitis, I happened to be attending him. That geisha was a high-class prostitute (*rokko*) even in the top pleasure quarters, and her age was close to twenty-six or seven, or even thirty (since geisha do not disclose their age accurately, this is an estimate). She was commonly known as a heavily ripened, middle-aged woman (*ōtoshima*) fully covered in fat. Her plump, meaty hips, which looked appealing to men, were said to be the very reason for her being a prostitute.

Anesthesia was applied to her internal organs. However, since the anesthesia was expected not to work on this geisha, who habitually drinks, the surgeon reluctantly proceeded to incise using local anesthesia.

Since the muscles of the abdomen are painful even when flexed slightly, she could not endure it. She thrashed about, straining the bands that tied her hands and feet almost to the point of tearing them. What would the geisha, who usually keeps her mouth shut and smiles secretly in the presence of her patron in that refined establishment, be thinking, reduced to that uninhibited state of weeping? "AA It hurts... It hurts... It hurts... It hurt!" "H It hurts... It hurts... HH—tsu!" "Help me, help me..." she cried without consonants or vowels, shouting, "It hurts!" and roaring, "Stop it!" "Leave the geisha alone!" She even kicked the surgeon. Losing the spirit to mock the surgeon's composure as he refused to relax his grip on the scalpel, she finally collapsed into quiet sobs, raising a faint wail of "It hurts!" and shedding big tears.

Therefore, there are no aesthetic elements involved. This is also an embarrassing story for me. It was said that the female doctor who, during an operation on the head or bone marrow of a child, caused trouble for the accompanying mother with her screams, was a "meatball" (a plump person).

Anesthesia was applied to her internal organs. However, since the anesthesia was expected not to work on this geisha, who habitually drinks, the surgeon reluctantly proceeded to incise using local anesthesia.

I have spoken at length concerning the screams of women, but the current state where all popular magazines fall into mannerism regarding "the scream" is regrettable. At least I, *Kitan Club*, would like you to use life drawing (*shasei*) to create realistic depictions. Since *Kitan Club* is fulfilling in terms of illustrations, I anticipate that an author will emerge who, in the world of text, researches expressions of screaming not seen in other magazines.

I hope that this clumsy essay of mine will serve as a stimulus, leading to a continuation of vivid confessional diaries by "subjects of masochistic experience" (*higyaku taikensha*) on the topic of 'Concerning the Scream,' and with that, I conclude my writing. (End)

### On the Screams of Women

I once attended the president of a motoring company when he was hospitalized for appendicitis. The woman in question was a geisha, a high-ranking courtesan (*rokko*) even in the premier pleasure districts, aged somewhere between twenty-six or seven and nearly thirty (geisha, of course, are imprecise about such things). She was popularly known as a ripe, middle-aged woman, heavily endowed with fat. Her fleshy, curvaceous hips, which were overtly appealing to men, were apparently the very foundation of her trade.

She was scheduled to have anesthesia administered internally. However, being a habitual drinker, the geisha was not expected to be affected by the usual dose, so the surgeon reluctantly proceeded with local anesthesia and an incision.

The abdominal muscles are painful even under slight tension, so she was utterly unable to bear it. She thrashed around wildly, almost tearing apart the bands that restrained her arms and legs. To think of this woman—who, in the refined teahouse, held her tongue and smiled demurely before her patron—reduced to such an unrestrained, animalistic display of weeping! "AA It hurts... Hurts... Hurts... Ouch!" "H Hurts... Hurts... HH—tsu!" "Help me... Help me please..." she shrieked, consonants and vowels dissolving into pure sound, crying "Ouch!" and roaring, "Stop! Leave the geisha alone!" She even kicked the surgeon. Finally losing the will even to scorn the surgeon’s cold composure as he maintained his hold on the scalpel, she collapsed, managing only a faint whisper of "It hurts!" while fat tears rolled down her cheeks.

There was certainly nothing aesthetic about it. I must also recount this embarrassing anecdote: The female doctor, a 'meatball' of a woman, was said to have made the accompanying mother frantic with her screams during an operation on a child’s head or bone marrow.

[***Duplicated Section Omitted***]

I have written at length concerning the screams of women, but I find it regrettable that all major popular magazines have fallen into mannerism when addressing "the scream." We, *Kitan Club*, desire authors to employ realistic drawing (*shasei*) for genuine description. Since *Kitan Club* is already rich in the realm of illustration, I hope that in the world of text, we can foster writers who will study and provide expressions of the scream that are truly unique and not found in other journals.

I hope that this crude essay of mine might serve as a stimulus, prompting a continuous flow of raw confessional diaries from those who have endured *higyaku* (masochistic or victimized) experiences under the title, 'Concerning the Scream.' With that hope, I put down my brush. (End)

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Pseudo-Reportage / Found Observation / Editorial Feature disguised as an eyewitness account. It uses the narrative framework of journalism (the hospital attendant) but pivots strongly into editorial commentary and a call for specific literary content (the final two paragraphs). |
| **Author Attribution** | Anonymous or Pseudonymous. The narrator is a "former attendant" (看護したこともあります) who is positioned as a sophisticated observer. The voice shifts in the final section to the magazine's editorial 'we' (『奇譚クラブ』あたい) reinforcing the magazine's agenda. |
| **Editorial Voice** | The editorial voice (final section) explicitly demands **realism (写生)** and **non-conventional expression** regarding pain and distress ("the scream"). It champions *Kitan Club* as superior due to its strong illustrations, but challenges its writers to meet that standard in text by focusing on **被虐体験** (masochistic/victim experiences). |
| **Target Audience** | Readers interested in the confluence of medical horror, sadomasochism, the vulnerability of "elite" women (geisha), and the analysis of raw human suffering. |
| **Structural Anomaly** | The description of the geisha’s surgery, starting from "Anesthesia was applied..." is repeated almost exactly in the third and fourth major paragraphs. This suggests either a copying error during typesetting, an archival mistake, or, less likely, an intentional stylistic repetition to emphasize the traumatic nature of the scene. Given the context of rushed pulp publishing, a typesetting error is most probable. |
| **Positioning** | Page 31, suggesting a short, punchy feature rather than a major serialized work. |
| **Tone** | Clinical, observational, yet highly sensational and exploitative of the subject's pain. |

---

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

| Annotation Point | Explanation & Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Era** | Likely Showa Period, mid-century (1950s/early 1960s), coinciding with the peak of *Kitan Club*'s publication, characterized by exploring taboo subjects under the guise of pseudo-scientific or journalistic reportage. |
| **Geisha (芸者) / 売っ妓 (Rokko)** | The subject is immediately categorized. While *geisha* are entertainers, *rokko* explicitly means "selling prostitute" or a high-class call girl whose services extend beyond entertainment. This categorization places her outside respectable society, making her suffering a permissible subject for sensationalism. |
| **脂肪の乗り切った大年増** | "Heavily ripened, middle-aged woman fully covered in fat." This phrase specifically fetishizes the subject's body type. The "fat" (脂肪) is not merely descriptive but is linked to her professional success as a *rokko*, suggesting a high-maintenance, luxurious, yet animalistic physical presence—a common object of desire/contempt in ero-guro narratives. |
| **Anesthesia/Pain** | The narrative hinges on the failure of normal anesthesia due to habitual drinking (a common, if often false, medical myth of the era) necessitating local anesthesia. This choice ensures the subject remains conscious, allowing the narrator to fully observe and document her "animalistic" screams and struggles, fulfilling the sadomasochistic core fantasy. |
| **The Scream (悲鳴)** | The central theme. The author claims other magazines use "mannerism" (マンネリズム), implying they use conventional, sentimental language for pain. *Kitan Club* demands *shasei* (realistic drawing/depiction) of raw, primal, uninhibited screams, symbolized by the "AA," "HH," and the loss of clear vowels/consonants. |
| **被虐体験者 (Higyaku Taikensha)** | "Subject of masochistic experience." This explicit editorial call confirms the magazine's agenda. It is seeking confessional writings from individuals who have endured physical/sexual hardship or trauma, framed as literature. This term directly links the surgical scene to S&M literature. |
| **女医の肉団 (Female Doctor's Meatball)** | This bizarre, secondary anecdote seems intended to confirm the narrator's unsympathetic, clinical-yet-vulgar worldview, where even a female medical professional is reduced to a crude physical description ("meatball"/plump body) and associated with causing trauma to children. |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Japanese) | Standard Meaning | Contextual/Historical Nuance | NLP/AI Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **売っ妓 (Rokko)** | Selling prostitute, high-class courtesan. | Explicitly defines the geisha as commercial/sexual property. Used dismissively. | High-value, class/sexual marker. |
| **大年増 (Ōtoshima)** | Middle-aged woman. | Pejorative, often implying ripeness, excessive plumpness, or lack of youth/refinement. | Age/body shaming, fetish object. |
| **脂肪の乗り切った** | Fully covered in fat. | Emphasizes her luxurious, overly mature physique, contrasting with the vulnerability of the procedure. | Physical descriptor, eroticized body type. |
| **局所麻酔 (Kyokusho Masui)** | Local anesthesia. | Crucial plot device allowing the patient to remain conscious and struggle against the restraints. | Medical setting, source of torture/restraint. |
| **口を噤め (Kuchi wo tsume)** | To shut one's mouth. | Refers to her trained composure in her professional life, contrasting with her primitive screams during surgery. | Behavior/composure contrast. |
| **露れもない (Tsure mo nai)** | Uninhibited, unadorned (Literally: without display/modesty). | Describes the raw, animalistic nature of her suffering, stripped of social grace. | Core thematic element (shame/vulnerability). |
| **マンネリズム (Mannerism)** | Stale, conventional style. | Editorial critique of rival/mainstream magazines for insufficiently graphic depictions of pain. | Editorial self-justification/genre definition. |
| **被虐体験者 (Higyaku Taikensha)** | Subject of abuse/victim/masochist. | Direct linkage to S&M literature; seeking confessional accounts of physical suffering. | Explicit S&M tag. |

---

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

| Theme | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Involuntary Submission** | The central fantasy is the high-class, beautiful, and powerful courtesan being reduced to a helpless, struggling animal against the cool, professional force of the male surgeon (authority). She is physically restrained, and her cries are ignored. |
| **The Body as Commodity** | The description of her "fatty meat hips" reinforces that her body is strictly commercial property. The suffering she undergoes in the clinical setting is a disruption of this commerce, yet simultaneously a new, fetishistic way of consuming that body. |
| **Voyeurism and Authority** | The narrator, a former attendant, occupies a position of privileged observation, recording the woman's complete loss of dignity ("her uninhibited state of weeping"). The surgical table functions as a stage for this eroticized observation. |
| **Pain and Linguistic Breakdown** | The focus on the specific sounds ("AA," "HH," lack of consonants/vowels) suggests the breakdown of language and social form under extreme duress. The screams are the purest expression of her state, satisfying the editor's call for "realistic depiction" (写生). |
| **Medical Fetishism (Iatrophilia)** | The clinical setting, restraints, cold surgeon, and the forced, painful incision are highly eroticized elements, common in the ero-guro genre where the hospital/doctor becomes a site of ritualized sadism. |

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** High. (Explicit fetishization of a woman's body during a vulnerable state; S/M undertones; focus on pain as arousal).
*   **Violence:** Medium-High. (Implied violence/coercion via non-consensual physical restraint and forced, painful medical procedure described sensationally).
*   **Coercion:** Explicit. (The woman is restrained by bands and forced to endure the procedure against her will and resistance).
*   **Medical / Bodily Themes:** High. (Surgical procedure, anesthesia failure, incision, abdominal muscles, tears, screaming).
*   **Taboo or Illegal Implications:** Medium. (The explicit editorial call for diaries from "subjects of masochistic experience" suggests an interest in accounts of abuse/trauma.)
