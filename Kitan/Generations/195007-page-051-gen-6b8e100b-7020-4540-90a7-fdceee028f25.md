「あゝ米一升持つて行けば良いんだー」
「ほう！そうか。それで女は良えのか？」
「おゝ、凄い別嬪だぞ、それに何とも云えん体しとるぞ！お前も一遍抱いて来いよ、息のあるうちに力なー」

この暗い陰鬱な死の谷間に閉じこめられ、毎日惡魔の様な砲弾のうなりを聞いていると、只それだけで壽命がちぢみ、生命力がうすれてゆく思いがした。
死神が枯木のような腕を伸ばして追つて来るのが見えるような気がする時があつた。
死ぬ迄に何か美味しいものを腹一杯喰い度い、そして出来る事なら一度で良い、美しい女を抱いて見度い。それは兵隊であり男である彼等の偽らざる欲求だつた。
米一升を得る事は、その時の彼等にとつては決して優しい仕事ではなかつた。死の谷を蔽う、瞬時の切れ間もない弾幕を、死物狂いで走り抜け、元日本軍の籾集積所に潜入し（そこは現在敵陣の一隅になつて居た）
脱鬼の様に持ち帰り、その籾をコツコツと搗いて精米にするのである。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Cave Prostitute** — **Hinata Michio**

"On the battlefield, a *pan-pan* existed.
In the battlefield where shell roars, the smell of death, and gunpowder smoke drift!
Beautiful and mysterious eyes burning with lust, a robust
female body thrown before the eyes...
He, for a moment, felt confusion.
Swollen breasts are violently breathing.
The moistly sweating woman's skin, softly
touching him, he already lost power of thought."

**1**
Northern Philippine Luzon interior, mountain town Kiangan, from there about four houses deep, Yamaguchi Village (place name given by the army for strategy). There they (the unit) were surrounded by the American army, under the iron heavy rain of the American army pouring down 24 hours a day, were fighting with starvation and pestilence. Against the American army, while in an almost no-resistance state, the soldiers were falling one after another.
Corporal Nakada, for excretion, crouched on the night mountain slope. The American shells were concentrated on the dark opposing mountain, in its middle repeatedly making eerie explosions. While he was vacantly, without any emotion, gazing at that firework-like beautiful sparkling, from the other side of the bushes on the left, talking voices came to be heard.
The conversation was continued in mumble-mumble low voices, but it had a sound that strangely stimulated a person’s interest. That conversation, without even trying to listen, naturally entered Corporal Nakada’s ears.
"Ah, if you take one *sho* of rice, it's fine."
"Ho! Is that so. And with that, the woman is okay?"
"Oh, she's a great beauty, and she has an indescribable body! You too, go embrace her once, while you have breath in your body."
Low laughter was transmitted.
"In the daytime, she is in a side-hole in the valley below here, but when it becomes night, look, there is one house where the road below turns, she comes 'on a business trip' to the small hut below that!"
"Hoon."
The speaker seemed to be Leading Private Hamaguchi of the First Platoon, but the partner was not known.
In Nakada’s mind, something like a black shadow quickly crossed. And inside he felt some kind of incomprehensible resentment.
(I see! It was true!)
Since about ten days ago, he had been hearing such rumors occasionally, but "No way?" he had thought. However, when thinking about it, it was also thought to be a natural thing. They had all lost hope in the thing called stepping on the soil of the homeland again alive. He himself was also so.
In this dark gloomy valley of death being shut in, hearing every day the demon-like roar of shells, just by that alone, it felt like life span was shrinking and life force was thinning away.
There were times when it felt like seeing the God of Death extending arms like withered trees and chasing.
Before dying, want to eat something delicious to a full belly, and if possible, once is fine, want to try embracing a beautiful woman. That was the honest desire of them who were soldiers and men.
To obtain one *sho* of rice was for them at that time by no means an easy job. Covering the valley of death, through the barrage with not even an instant’s gap, running like crazy, infiltrating the former Japanese army grain collection point (that place currently had become a corner of the enemy camp),
like a fleeing demon bringing it back, that unhulled rice bit by bit pounding, they make into polished rice.
That blood-seeping-like precious rice, it is said there is a woman who coolly exploits it.

**The Cave Prostitute**
By Michio Hinata

**"A 'pan-pan' girl walked the killing fields.**
**Amidst the roar of artillery, the stench of rotting flesh, and the drifting haze of gunpowder smoke!**
**Beautiful, bewitching eyes burning with desire, a supple, powerful female body thrust before his very eyes...**
**For a moment, he was overcome with bewilderment.**
**Her full breasts heaved with ragged breath.**
**As her moist, sweat-beaded skin brushed against his, he felt his very ability to think slip away."**

**1**
Deep in the hinterlands of Northern Luzon in the Philippines lay the mountain town of Kiangan. A short distance further in was Yamaguchi Village—a name bestowed upon the hamlet by the army for strategic purposes. It was there that the unit found itself encircled by American forces. Under a relentless, twenty-four-hour deluge of American steel, the men waged a desperate war against starvation and disease. Offering almost no resistance to the enemy, the soldiers were collapsing one after another.

Corporal Nakada crouched on the darkened mountain slope to relieve himself. American shells were concentrated on the black mass of the opposing ridge, their eerie explosions blooming incessantly across its midsection. As he gazed vacantly at the flashes—beautiful as fireworks yet devoid of meaning to him—the sound of voices drifted from the thicket to his left.

The conversation was hushed, a low murmur, yet it possessed a cadence that strangely piqued his curiosity. Without even trying to eavesdrop, the words began to filter into his consciousness.

"Yeah, all you need is a gallon of rice."
"Hah! Really? And the girl is okay with that?"
"Man, she’s a real knockout. Got a body you wouldn't believe! You ought to go have a go with her once while you’ve still got the breath of life in you."

A low, guttural chuckle followed.

"During the day, she hides out in a cave in the valley below. But at night, you know that house where the road bends down there? She comes 'on call' to that little shack right underneath it!"
"Is that right..."

Nakada recognized the speaker as Leading Private Hamaguchi from the First Platoon, though he couldn't place the other man. A dark shadow flickered across Nakada’s mind, and he felt a surge of inexplicable resentment well up within him.

*So, it was true after all!*

He had been hearing snippets of such rumors for about ten days now, but he had dismissed them as impossible. On second thought, however, it seemed only natural. Every one of them had long since abandoned the hope of ever setting foot on their native soil alive. He was no different. 

Trapped in this dismal, gloomy valley of death, the constant, demonic shriek of incoming shells felt like it was physically whittling away at his lifespan and draining his very will to live. There were moments when he could almost see the Grim Reaper, reaching out with withered, skeletal arms to claim him.

To eat one last delicious meal until his belly was full, and—if possible—to hold a beautiful woman just once before the end... these were the raw, honest cravings of men facing certain death.

But obtaining a gallon of rice was no small feat. It meant sprinting like a madman through a relentless barrage of fire that blanketed the valley, infiltrating a former Japanese supply depot that was now tucked inside the enemy lines. It meant hauling the grain back like a ghost fleeing hell, then painstakingly pounding the husks to produce polished rice.

And yet, word had it there was a woman who was callously extorting this precious, blood-soaked rice from them.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Hierarchy:** The text uses a standard vertical (tategaki) layout. The title and author are prominently placed at the top right.
*   **Typography:** The teaser/intro text is set in a larger, bolder weight than the main narrative, functioning as a "hook" or blurb to entice the reader. 
*   **Visual Elements:** There is a stylized, noir-esque illustration at the center. It depicts a woman's face and shoulder in the foreground, with her eyes closed or looking down, and a man's face (likely Corporal Nakada) looking on from the background with a troubled expression. This visual style is characteristic of post-war pulp magazines.
*   **Column Structure:** The main body of the story is divided into two horizontal tiers (rows) of vertical text, a common format for Japanese magazines to increase readability on a large page.
*   **Pagination:** The page is numbered "-52-" at the bottom, suggesting it is part of a longer serial or a collection of short stories.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Battle of Luzon (1945):** The setting is the final, desperate retreat of the Japanese Imperial Army into the mountains of Northern Luzon. Kiangan was the site of General Yamashita's final headquarters and eventual surrender. The depiction of starvation ("war against starvation") and "iron rain" (heavy US artillery) is historically accurate to the "hellish" conditions reported by survivors.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text belongs to the "Kasutori" genre of the late 1940s and early 50s. Named after a cheap, low-quality liquor, these magazines focused on the "three S's": Sport, Screen (movies), and Sex. They often featured "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) stories that blended the trauma of the war with titillating or sensationalist elements.
*   **"Pan-pan" (パンパン):** This term usually referred to street prostitutes in occupied Japan who catered to GIs. Its use here in a wartime Philippine setting is somewhat of an anachronism or a loose application of a then-contemporary buzzword to describe a woman providing sexual services to soldiers.
*   **Rice as Currency:** In the final stages of the war, Japanese supply lines were cut. Rice became more valuable than money or gold. The "one sho" (approx. 1.8 liters) of rice mentioned as payment represents an immense sacrifice, as soldiers had to risk their lives to steal it back from captured depots.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **比島 (Hishō):** An abbreviation for the Philippines (フィリピン).
*   **鉄の豪雨 (Tetsu no gōu):** Literally "heavy rain of iron," a common metaphor for intense artillery bombardment.
*   **伍長 (Gochō):** Corporal.
*   **兵長 (Heichō):** Leading Private / Lance Corporal.
*   **別嬪 (Beppin):** A beautiful woman.
*   **一升 (Isshō):** A traditional unit of volume, approximately 1.8 liters.
*   **脱鬼 (Dakki):** Literally "fleeing demon." Used here to describe the desperate, almost inhuman way the soldiers moved through enemy fire.
*   **搾取 (Sakushu):** Exploitation/Extortion. In this context, it implies the woman is taking advantage of the soldiers' desperation.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Desperation vs. Desire:** The core theme is the persistence of human desire (sexual and physical) even in the face of imminent death. The text juxtaposes the "smell of death" with the "scent of a woman."
*   **Nihilism and Fatalism:** The characters have lost hope of returning to Japan. This nihilism justifies their risky behavior—trading life-sustaining rice for a moment of pleasure.
*   **The "Femme Fatale" in War:** The woman in the cave is framed both as a source of comfort and a "cold exploiter" who takes the soldiers' "blood-soaked rice." This reflects a complex post-war view of female survival and the perceived "betrayal" of soldiers by those who profited from their suffering.
*   **Eroticism as Escapism:** The vivid descriptions of "swelling breasts" and "sweaty skin" serve as a sensory escape for both the characters in the story and the readers of the magazine.
