## 2️⃣ Normalized Japanese (現代仮名遣い)

しても、まず無理である。縛られるだけのためにノコノコとラブホテルへついてくる女なんていうのは、皆無といってよかろう。試しに、「ちょっと縛らせてくれませんか」と女の子に頼んでみるがいい。気狂い〔キチガイ〕だと思われるのがオチである。

ＳＭ小説などには、縛られたがる女がよく登場するが、そういう女は現実にはいない。マゾ女は見つけるものではなく、普通の女をマゾに飼育していくものなのである。

そこで、ハントする場合に、その女にマゾ性があるかどうか見極めなくてはならない。「マゾ性」というのは、まだマゾとしての自覚がない状態のことで、マゾ性が多ければ飼育次第でマゾに目覚めるが、少なければいくら飼育してもマゾにはならない。

これは当然のことなのだが、「女にはすべてマゾの要素がある」などと一部の人間がバカなことをいうものだから、女は縛られるのを喜ぶと本気で信じる者が出てくるのだ。縛られて喜ぶのは、マゾに目覚めた女だけである。

マゾ性があるかないかということより、どれくらい多くマゾ性を持っているかということが、ハントする場合に必要な洞察力なのだ。

性格のきつい女よりもおとなしい女を選ぶのは当然として、おとなしい女にもいろいろあることを知っておかなければならない。
おとなしくても芯の強い女もいるし、性モラルに忠実でＳＭプレイなどは嫌悪する女もいる。おとなしいからといって、すべてＳＭプレイを許してくれるわけではないのだ。
そういうわけで、マゾ性が多く、飼育によってマゾに目……

## 3️⃣ Literal English Translation

Even so, it is firstly impossible. To say that a woman who would nonchalantly follow [someone] to a love hotel just for the sake of being tied up is non-existent would be accurate. Try asking a girl, "Won't you let me tie you up a little?" The punchline will be that you are thought to be insane.

In SM novels and the like, women who want to be tied up appear often, but such women do not exist in reality. A masochist woman is not something one finds; rather, it is something where one rears/breeds a normal woman into a masochist.

Therefore, when hunting [for a partner], one must ascertain whether that woman has "masochistic nature" (*mazo-sei*). "Masochistic nature" refers to a state where there is not yet self-awareness as a masochist; if the masochistic nature is high, she will awaken as a masochist depending on the rearing, but if it is low, no matter how much you rear her, she will not become a masochist.

This is a matter of course, but because some humans say stupid things like "all women have elements of masochism," people emerge who seriously believe that women are happy to be bound. The ones who are happy to be bound are only women who have awakened to masochism.

Rather than whether she has masochistic nature or not, the necessary insight when hunting is [determining] how much masochistic nature she possesses.

*(Bottom Right Block)*
Assuming it is natural to choose a docile woman over a woman with a harsh personality, one must know that there are various types even among docile women.

There are women who are docile but have a strong core, and there are women who are faithful to sexual morals and detest things like SM play. Just because she is docile does not mean she will permit all SM play.
For that reason, [finding a woman who has] much masochistic nature, and [can be awakened] to masochism via rearing...

## 4️⃣ Literary English Translation

Even so, let’s be realistic: it is impossible. You can safely assume that there is absolutely no woman who would nonchalantly follow you to a love hotel solely for the purpose of being tied up. Go ahead and try asking a girl, "Would you mind letting me tie you up for a bit?" The only result will be that she thinks you are a lunatic.

While women who desire bondage appear frequently in SM fiction, such women do not exist in reality. A masochistic woman is not something you find ready-made; she is something you create by taking a normal woman and "training" (*shiiku*) her into one.

Therefore, when you are on the hunt, you must determine whether the woman possesses a "masochistic nature." This nature refers to a latent state where she has not yet realized she is a masochist. If she possesses this nature in abundance, she can be awakened through training. However, if she possesses very little of it, no amount of training will turn her into a masochist.

This should be obvious, but because some idiots claim that "all women have masochistic elements," there are men who genuinely believe that women simply enjoy being bound. The only women who enjoy bondage are those who have already been awakened.

When hunting, the insight required is not merely asking if she has a masochistic nature, but discerning *how much* of that nature she possesses.

*(Bottom Right Block)*
While it goes without saying that you should choose a docile woman over one with a strong personality, you must understand that "docile" women come in many varieties.

There are women who appear quiet but possess a strong will, just as there are those who are strictly faithful to sexual morals and find SM play repulsive. Being quiet does not mean she will permit any and all SM play. Therefore, finding a woman with high masochistic potential who can be awakened through training is...

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** Editorial / Instructional Essay (How-to).
*   **Narrative Voice:** The author adopts the persona of a cynical, experienced "Master" or mentor. The tone is authoritative, dismissing popular fantasies (which the magazine itself likely publishes) in favor of a "realistic" predatory approach.
*   **Target Audience:** Men interested in BDSM who are looking to move from consumption of fiction to actual practice. The text assumes the reader is male and actively looking to "hunt" (pick up) partners.
*   **Layout:** Standard multi-column layout for essays. The text wraps around a photograph that serves as a visual proof of the "result" of the training described—a woman in complex suspension bondage.

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Shiiku (飼育 - Rearing/Breeding):** A critical term in Japanese counter-culture and erotica. It implies the raising of animals, stripping away the human social contract to mold a subject. It reflects a fantasy of total control common in post-war male literature (e.g., Oe Kenzaburo's *The Catch/Shiiku*, though used differently there, shares the root concept of captivity).
*   **The "Myth" of the SM Novel:** The author explicitly breaks the fourth wall of the genre. Magazines like *Kitan Club* were famous for fantastical stories of willing victims. This article posits itself as the "truth" behind the fiction, creating a sense of insider knowledge for the reader.
*   **Love Hotels (ラブホテル):** Mentioned as the venue for these encounters. In the mid-Showa era, these were (and remain) the primary spaces for non-marital sexual privacy in Japan.
*   **Mental Hygiene:** The use of "Kichigai" (Lunatic/Crazy) reflects the era's stigmatization of mental illness, but here it is used colloquially to describe how the general public views SM practitioners—highlighting the subculture's awareness of its own taboo status.

## 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes

*   **Hanto (ハント):** From the English "Hunt." In Showa slang, this was synonymous with *nanpa* (street pickup), but carries a more predatory, game-like nuance here.
*   **Nokonoko (ノコノコ):** An onomatopoeia/mimetic word describing someone walking unconcernedly or nonchalantly into a situation where they should be cautious. It emphasizes the foolishness of expecting a victim to walk into a trap willingly.
*   **Mazo-sei (マゾ性):** "Masochistic nature/potential." The suffix *-sei* implies a chemical or biological property, treating the personality trait as a measurable raw material.
*   **Otonashii (おとなしい):** "Docile," "Quiet," or "Obedient." The ideal trait sought by the author, reflecting traditional gender roles, yet the text warns that this surface trait can hide "moral rigidity."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Pygmalion/Svengali Fantasy:** The core theme is that the perfect partner is *made*, not found. This validates the reader's potential lack of success in finding willing partners by shifting the goalpost to "training."
*   **Predation vs. Consent:** The text outlines a strategy of deception and psychological assessment. It does not advocate purely consensual negotiation but rather "awakening" latent tendencies through "breeding/training."
*   **Realism vs. Fantasy:** The text derives authority by debunking the very myths the magazine usually sells. "Don't believe the stories we print; real dominance requires work and insight."
*   **Misogyny & Objectification:** Women are categorized by their utility and "raw material" (masochistic nature). They are objects to be assessed, hunted, and molded.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Genre:** Non-fiction / Instructional / SM Erotica.
*   **Sexual Content:** High (Discussion of BDSM dynamics).
*   **Themes:** Bondage (Kinbaku), Masochism, "Training" (Shiiku), Predatory Sexual Behavior.
*   **Language:** Dated, Objectifying, Instructional.
*   **Visuals:** Partial nudity (lingerie), Suspension bondage.
