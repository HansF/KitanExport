**Coquettish Autumn Evening Five Daughters**
**Miyaikkoku Hisao**
**Kibayashi Akira, Illustration**

**1. Taste of a Virgin**

Wristwatch is exactly 8 o'clock. When the workers' rush hour finishes for a while, as expected the congestion in front of Hankyu also becomes quiet like a lie, and from Nakazaki-cho in the east to around Sakurabashi in the west, the famous "angels of the night" start to loiter.
An autumn evening moment is worth a thousand pieces of gold; even though it's already muggy, unfortunately the wife is helping with a relative's wedding or something, and taking the children, went to her parents' home in the Shikoku countryside and has been absent for about five days. Even if I return now, at my house in the lonely suburban residential area, it's just a matter of gobbling down canned food, "Che, worthless..." and a bit of rebellious spirit rose up smolderingly, which was the bad thing.
Usually, if I leave the company, I immediately rush to the Kitahama intersection, hang from a bus, and without looking aside, hurry toward Hankyu (tell a lie!), I who have that habit, suddenly thinking "the laundry while the ogre is away" or such, invited a girl from another department who returns via the same Hankyu, and wandering from Naniwabashi through Nakanoshima Park, entering a shiruko shop in front of the Do-Building was the start.
Usually she's a girl I talk to like siblings, and since we've gone to cafes several times, there shouldn't be a reason to get into that mood, but due to "autumn feelings being summoned" or so, after leaving the shiruko shop, in a dim street, I hugged her tightly with all my strength.
"Oh... you mustn't!"
While refusing with just the tip of her mouth like that, although she usually says she's a virgin, it's a suspicious thing; when I put my hand on her face and made her look up, she had her eyes properly closed and her lips thrust out.
Chance arrived; immediately dragging her into some hotel... and while the ambition rose smolderingly, wait, if a rumor starts about "stamping" a girl of about nineteen like this and getting fired from the company, the abacus won't balance, and even if I develop a sword fight with my wife, it's boring. Well, it's fine, the rest is according to my preference anytime, wait, wait... and there with the impudent discretion of an avant-guerre, I had about a 100-yen cake wrapped at a nearby confectionery shop,
"Today I'm going somewhere else for a bit, so here, this is a souvenir,"
and I pressed it into the girl's hand.
"But..., no, going home like this or something," to her snorting, I somehow or other coaxed her and watched her figure disappear into the Hankyu Kobe Line ticket gate, and took a breath of relief.
Now, from here starts a play; the time I took a breath of relief was exactly 8:20.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Coquettes of an Autumn Night: Five Maidens**
**By Hisao Miyaikkoku**
**Illustrated by Akira Kibayashi**

**I. A Taste of Innocence**

My watch read exactly eight o'clock. As the evening rush of office workers finally tapered off, the usual bustle in front of Hankyu Station subsided into an eerie silence. From Nakazaki-cho in the east to Sakurabashi in the west, the city's "angels of the night" began their nightly prowl.
"An hour of an autumn evening is worth a thousand pieces of gold," as they say. It was a muggy night, made worse by the fact that my wife had taken the kids to her parents' place in rural Shikoku to help with a relative's wedding. She’d been gone five days. Going home now meant nothing but a lonely meal of canned food in our quiet suburban house. "Dammit, what a bore," I muttered. It was that flicker of rebellion smoldering inside me that started the trouble.
Normally, I’m the type to bolt for the Kitahama intersection the moment work ends, hop on a bus, and head straight for the Hankyu line without a second glance (who am I kidding?). But tonight, deciding to "play while the cat’s away," I invited a girl from another department who takes the same train. We wandered from Naniwa Bridge through Nakanoshima Park and ended up at a sweet bean soup shop in front of the Do-Building. That was the beginning of it.
We usually talk like brother and sister, and we’ve been to cafes together plenty of times without any "mood" ever developing. But perhaps it was the sentimental chill of the autumn air; as soon as we stepped out of the shop into a dim alleyway, I found myself pulling her into a sudden, forceful embrace.
"Oh! You... you mustn't!" she protested, but it was only lip service. She always claims to be a virgin, but I had my doubts. When I tilted her chin up, her eyes were squeezed shut and her lips were already puckered, waiting.
The chance was right there. I felt a surge of desire to drag her straight to a hotel... but then I hesitated. If I "stamped" a nineteen-year-old girl and word got out, I’d lose my job—the math just didn't add up. And I certainly didn't want to start a "sword fight" with my wife when she got back. "Whatever," I thought, "I can have her whenever I want. Let's play it cool." With the shameless pragmatism of a pre-war man, I stopped at a nearby bakery, bought a hundred-yen cake, and shoved it into her hands.
"I have to stop somewhere else tonight. Here, take this as a gift."
"But... you can't mean we're just going home like this?" she huffed. I managed to sweet-talk her toward the Hankyu Kobe Line ticket gates. Only after watching her disappear into the station did I finally breathe a sigh of relief. 
Now, the real performance was about to begin. It was exactly 8:20.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is a classic example of Japanese magazine formatting from the mid-20th century. It uses vertical text (*tate-gaki*) arranged in three columns.
*   **Typography:** The main title is hand-lettered in a bold, stylized "Edomoji" or brush-calligraphy style, common for sensationalist or "low-brow" fiction of the era. Sub-headings use a standard bold Gothic-style font.
*   **Illustration:** The header features an ink illustration by Akira Kibayashi. It depicts an urban scene (likely Osaka, given the text) with a cafe called "喫茶 AB" and people in Western-style coats, reflecting the "Modern Boy/Modern Girl" aesthetic that lingered into the post-war period.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title occupies the top right, followed by the author and illustrator credits. The story is numbered ("一"), suggesting this is the first installment of a series or a collection of short stories.
*   **Punctuation:** The text uses standard Japanese punctuation but includes Western-style parentheses for internal monologues or comedic asides (e.g., `(嘘をつけ！) - "Yeah, right!" / "Liar!"`).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** Based on the kanji usage (a mix of *kyūjitai* and some simplified forms), the geography (post-war Osaka), and the price of a cake (100 yen), this likely dates from the **late 1940s to early 1950s**. This was the "Kasutori" era, characterized by cheap, sensationalist magazines that focused on romance, erotica, and urban life.
*   **Geography:** The text is set in **Osaka**. It mentions specific landmarks:
    *   **Hankyu:** The major railway terminal in Umeda.
    *   **Kitahama, Nakanoshima, Naniwabashi:** Business and park districts in central Osaka.
    *   **Do-Building (Do-Biru):** The Dojima Building, a prominent landmark.
*   **Social Conventions:** The protagonist is a "salaryman" struggling with the boredom of suburban life. The phrase "Night Angels" (*yoru no tenshi*) is a common euphemism for prostitutes of that era (often "pan-pan" girls in the post-war period).
*   **The "Virgin" Trope:** The title and the protagonist's internal monologue reflect a period-specific obsession with female "purity" versus the reality of changing sexual mores in the post-war "liberated" Japan.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **嬌態 (Kyōtai):** Coquettishness, alluring pose, or flirtatious behavior.
*   **秋宵一刻價千金 (Shūshō ikkoku atai senkin):** A variation of a famous Chinese poem line ("A moment of a spring evening is worth a thousand gold pieces"), substituted here with "Autumn" to set the seasonal mood.
*   **夜の天使 (Yoru no tenshi):** "Angels of the night," a euphemism for streetwalkers.
*   **鬼の留守の洗濯 (Oni no rusu no sentaku):** Literally "doing laundry while the ogre is away." A Japanese idiom meaning "to relax/play while the person you fear (usually a boss or wife) is absent." Equivalent to "When the cat's away, the mice will play."
*   **ソロバンが合わん (Soroban ga awan):** Literally "the abacus doesn't match." Meaning "it doesn't pay" or "the risk outweighs the reward."
*   **アバンゲール (Abangēru):** A loanword from the French *avant-guerre* (pre-war). Used here to describe the protagonist's "old-school" or "pre-war" mindset/shrewdness.
*   **ちゃんばら (Chanbara):** Usually refers to sword-fighting movies, but here used metaphorically for a violent domestic dispute with his wife.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Urban Ennui and Temptation:** The story highlights the contrast between the dull "canned food" life of the suburbs and the neon-lit temptations of the city center.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The protagonist views the girl as a "chance" to be weighed against his job security. There is a cynical, almost predatory tone common in male-centric "pulp" fiction of this era.
*   **The "Salaryman" Identity:** The narrative captures the burgeoning identity of the white-collar worker—calculating (using the "abacus"), weary of family obligations, and seeking brief excitement.
*   **Post-war Materialism:** The mention of the "100-yen cake" as a tool for dismissal shows a transition into a consumerist society where emotions and "incidents" can be smoothed over with modest sums of money.
