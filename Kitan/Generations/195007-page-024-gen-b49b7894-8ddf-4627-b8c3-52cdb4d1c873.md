嬉しくも何ともなかった。懐中三十八円也では、二人でお茶も飲めない。
（顔は見たいし、銭はなし、ほんとに浮世はままならぬ）など、生田君は妙な時に妙な文句をっ思い出す癖がある。
（なあに、会っちまえば何とかなる）
「いいお天気ねー！」と駅前のひかり喫茶店の前で待っていたクニコさんが言った。
「うん、いい天気だな。だけど、郊外へ行くのには、ちと時間が遅いわよ」
生田君は早速予防線を張った。
「誰も郊外へ行こうなんて言やしないわよ。どうして？」
「（理由）もないが……とにかく歩こう。黄昏の街はやっぱりいいブラブラしよう。」
など、つまらん所に感心してみせて、生田君は先に立って歩き出した。
新緑の街路はほこりっぽくて、人間が無闇にウロウロしているばかりで、ちっとも良くなんぞなかった。
「ね、お茶でも飲まない？」と来られたら何と返事をしよう、そればかりが苦になるのである。
「僕、胃が悪いから、お茶はよそう。」
そんな手もないし、「僕実はお金がないんだ」とも言えやしない……特に恋人クニコの前で、これが言えるもんか！ それに彼女だって、しがない女事務員（あぁ悲しいかな！）と生田君はもう一度思った。思いながら歩いた。クニコさんも歩いた。と！…………
落ちているではないか！ 何が！ 千円札が……
生田君はあっと想う間にそれを拾い上げていた。我ながら浅ましいと思ったが、これぞ天の賜物とも思ったのである。
「ねえちょっとー！」
彼は血相を変えてクニコさんの洋服の袖を引っ張って、否応なしに薄暗い横丁へ連れ込んだんだ。
「な、な、なーに！」
「と、と、これ拾ったですー！」と掌の中の例の四つ折りを見せた。
「まあ、千円札ね。そこの交番へ……」
「シッ、声が高い、届けるとは……んなぁ、猫ババ？」
「いや、実は僕……」
ここに至って、生田君はかくかくしかじか懐中金三十八円物語を、クニコさんにぶちまけてしまったのである。
「……だから、後で、千円都合して、交番に届けるんです。今日のところはちょっと融通させてもらおうではないですか」
「駄目よ！ 交番へ届けなくちゃ、捕まったらどうするのね」
そう言って、クニコさんは千円札を生田君の手からひったくって、ピンと皺を伸ばした。
途端に、これはどうした事であろう、真っ赤になって、慌てて生田君に押し返した。
おやっと思って、皺を伸ばされた千円札を、その裏をひょいと見た生田君も、クニコさんに劣らず真っ赤になった。
表は千円札そっくり、裏は不思議な絵が描いてあった。
生田君のその日の日記に曰く、「今日は恥を二度かいた」

（別の話）
かしら、女の性質を変えさせる力が男にあるのかしら。
「安ちゃん遊びに来て頂戴、誰も気兼ねする人居てへんからね、」
「うん、そのうちに寄せてもらうわ、」
街路樹の柳が細い葉をひらひらかえしながら二人の間に、二枚三枚散り落ちて来た。
―さようなら―
と、別れて立ち去る礼子の後ろ姿には、守ってくれる男のあるという安らぎがあって、落ち着いた足取りだった。新しい鼠色のウールのスーツを着ていた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

It was not joyful or anything. With 38 yen in the pocket, for two people even tea cannot be drunk.
(Face want to see, money none, truly the floating world is not as one wishes) etc., Ikuta-kun in strange times strange phrases remembers, has a habit.
(What, if [we] meet, it will work out somehow)
"Good weather, isn't it!" so saying, in front of the Hikari Coffee Shop by the station waiting, Kuniko-san said.
"Yeah, good weather it is. But, to go to the suburbs, a bit the time is late,"
Ikuta-kun immediately a defensive line stretched.
"Nobody to the suburbs to go said, you know. Why?"
"[Reason] is none but... anyway let's walk. The twilight street after all is good, let's wander wander."
Etc., at a trivial place impressed showing, Ikuta-kun ahead standing started walking.
The fresh green street was dusty, people aimlessly wandering wandering only, not at all good or anything was.
"Hey, tea or something won't you drink?" if [she] comes [with that], what reply shall I do, that alone becomes a pain.
"I, stomach is bad, so tea let's skip."
Such trick also not have, and "I actually money have none" also cannot say... especially in front of lover Kuniko, this can be said? No! Moreover she too, a paltry female office clerk (ah, sad indeed!) so Ikuta-kun once more thought. While thinking walked. Kuniko-san also walked. Then! ...
Is dropped, is it not! What! A thousand-yen bill is...
Ikuta-kun in a "ah!" thinking moment it picked up. Even myself felt wretched thought, but this surely Heaven's gift also thought.
"Hey, wait a bit!"
He, countenance changing, Kuniko-san's western clothes sleeve pulling, willy-nilly to a dim side alley dragged [her].
"Wha, wha, wha-what!"
"Th, th, this I picked up-su!" so the palm's inside's example four-fold [bill] showed.
"My, a thousand-yen bill, isn't it. To the nearby police box..."
"Shh, voice is high, to report is... what, nekobaba (pocketing)?"
"No, actually I..."
Reaching this point, Ikuta-kun this-and-that pocket money 38 yen story to Kuniko-san poured out.
"...Therefore, later, a thousand yen arranging, to the police box I will report. For today, a little flexibility let me receive, shall we not?"
"No good! To the police box must report, if caught what will you do?"
So saying, Kuniko-san the thousand-yen bill from Ikuta-kun's hand snatched, snap! the wrinkles stretched.
Right then, this what kind of thing would it be, turning deep red, in a hurry to Ikuta-kun pushed [it] back.
"Oh?" thinking, the wrinkles stretched thousand-yen bill, its back side flicking a look Ikuta-kun also, Kuniko-san not inferior to turning deep red became.
The front was a thousand-yen bill exactly, the back a strange picture was drawn.
Ikuta-kun's that day's diary says: "Today, shame twice I felt."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

He felt no joy at all. With only thirty-eight yen in his pocket, he couldn't even afford tea for the two of them.
*I want to see her face, but I haven't a cent; truly, this world never goes as one wishes.* Ikuta-kun had a habit of recalling such odd, poetic phrases at the strangest times. *Oh, well,* he thought, *once we meet, things will work out somehow.*

"What lovely weather!" said Kuniko, who had been waiting for him in front of the Hikari Café by the station.
"Yeah, it’s nice. But it’s a bit too late in the day to head out to the suburbs," Ikuta-kun said, immediately throwing up a defensive line.
"No one said anything about going to the suburbs. Why would you say that?"
"No reason... anyway, let's just walk. Wandering the streets at twilight is the best way to spend an evening."
Pretending to be impressed by such a trivial idea, Ikuta-kun took the lead and started walking. The streets, though filled with new spring greenery, were dusty and crowded with people aimlessly loitering; it wasn't pleasant at all. His mind was consumed by a single worry: what would he say if she asked, "Hey, want to grab some tea?"
"Actually, my stomach's been acting up, so let's skip the tea," he rehearsed.
He didn't have any other tricks up his sleeve, and he certainly couldn't bring himself to say, "The truth is, I’m broke"—especially not in front of his girlfriend, Kuniko. Besides, he reminded himself, she was just a lowly office clerk herself (how pathetic!). He kept walking, lost in these thoughts. Kuniko walked beside him. Then—!

There it was, lying on the ground! What was it? A thousand-yen bill!
In a flash, Ikuta-kun had snatched it up. He felt miserable for his own desperation, but at the same time, he couldn't help but think of it as a gift from the heavens.
"Hey, come here a second!"
His face pale with excitement, he grabbed Kuniko’s sleeve and dragged her into a dim side alley.
"Wh-wh-what is it?"
"L-l-look what I found!" he whispered, showing her the four-folded bill in his palm.
"Oh, a thousand-yen bill! We should take it to the police box..."
"Shh! Not so loud! Report it? Are you saying I should just... pocket it?"
"No, actually, I..."
At this point, Ikuta-kun poured out the whole story of the thirty-eight yen in his pocket.
"...So, I’ll pay it back later when I have the money and report it then. For today, can't we just use it for a bit of 'flexibility'?"
"No! You have to report it! What if you get caught?"
With that, Kuniko snatched the bill from his hand and snapped it flat to smooth the wrinkles.
Suddenly—and what a sight it was—she turned bright red and frantically shoved it back at him.
"Huh?" Ikuta-kun wondered. He took the flattened bill and flipped it over. He instantly turned just as red as Kuniko.
The front was a perfect replica of a thousand-yen note, but the back was covered in a bizarre advertisement.
That night, Ikuta-kun wrote in his diary: "Today, I was twice ashamed."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is structured into three vertical columns of text, though the flow is interrupted by a large central illustration. The first story wraps around the image.
*   **Typography:** Standard vertical Japanese typesetting of the mid-20th century. It uses some older kanji forms (like 變 for 変, 眞 for 真) and occasional archaic kana usage, though it is largely modern.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration serves as the focal point, depicting the two main characters (Ikuta and Kuniko) in a tense moment in an alleyway. The man looks frantic while the woman looks surprised.
*   **Separation:** The bottom of the third column features a series of 'x' marks, a common typographic device used to indicate a break between different stories or segments in a magazine.
*   **Punctuation:** Employs wavy dashes (～～) to indicate prolonged sounds or a wandering motion ("buro-buro," "uro-uro") and frequent use of exclamation points for dramatic effect.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The 1000-Yen Note:** In the late 1940s and early 1950s, 1,000 yen was a significant amount of money (the first 1,000-yen notes were issued in 1945 and 1950). Finding one on the street would be a major event for a struggling young man.
*   **Post-War Poverty:** The story reflects the "shabby-genteel" poverty of the post-war era. 38 yen was barely enough for a single cup of coffee, let alone a date.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The male protagonist feels a strong need to "protect his pride" (not admitting he is broke), while the female character is portrayed as more practical and morally upright (insisting on the police box).
*   **The "Nekobaba" Concept:** This is a specific Japanese term for finding lost property and keeping it for oneself. It carries a nuance of petty, sneaky theft.
*   **Health Subtext:** In the second snippet, the mention of "pain in the ribs" and the wind "chilling the bones" is a common literary trope for tuberculosis, which was a widespread "national disease" in Japan until the mid-1950s.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **しがねエ (Shiganee):** A rough, slangy pronunciation of *shiganai*, meaning paltry, miserable, or unimportant.
*   **猫ババ (Nekobaba):** Pocketing a found object; embezzling.
*   **血相を変えて (Kessō o kaete):** To change countenance, usually looking frantic, pale, or enraged.
*   **融通 (Yūzū):** Flexibility or accommodation, often used in a financial context to mean a short-term "loan" or "using funds temporarily."
*   **わくら葉 (Wakurable):** Sickly, discolored leaves (often used metaphorically for illness or decay).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Pride vs. Poverty:** Ikuta-kun would rather fake a stomach ache than admit he has no money. This highlights the social pressure on men to be providers and the embarrassment of poverty.
*   **The Illusion of Fortune:** The fake thousand-yen note is a classic "Short-Short" (a genre popularized by Shinichi Hoshi) trope—the sudden windfall that turns out to be a cruel joke or an advertisement.
*   **Urban Melancholy:** Both stories set a mood of post-war urban struggle. The first is comedic/satirical, while the second is somber and melancholic, touching on the brevity of life and the cold reality of illness.
*   **Moral Irony:** The "shame twice" refers to Ikuta's moral failure (deciding to steal) followed by his intellectual failure (being fooled by a fake bill).

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story (Palm-of-the-hand story), Magazine Piece.
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Poverty, Romance, Ethics, Humour, Melancholy.
*   **Era:** Showa Era (Late 1940s–Early 1950s).
