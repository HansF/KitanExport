三、奇形動物製造工場

「君、歳はいくつなんだい？」
「十八よ」
「名前は？」
「由紀子――細川由紀子っていうのよ」
それから、娘――由紀子は、真に僕に親しんで、色々なことを僕に話すのです。
僕が、その次に、
「出身はどこか」
と尋ねたことから、彼女は奇妙不思議な身上話、いや、奇々怪々な「奇形動物製造工場」について細々と語り出したのです。
「生まれた所なんかどこだっていいでしょう。あたしは、生まれてから十三年間、両親や兄弟たちと一緒に幸福に暮らしてきたんです。それがあの恐ろしい戦争です――。
そして、私たち親子五人、生死不明のまま散り散りバラバラ。一人ぼっちになったあたしは、どうせ身を滅ぼさなけりゃ、生きていけないんですからね。
私は、売笑婦になることを覚悟しましたわ。ええ、ご飯をいただくために身を落とすのは、ちっとも恥ずかしくないと信じましたもの――。
ところが売られてきた所は、種々様々な奇形物を作って、世界の隅々まで輸出して莫大な利益を得ている『奇形動物製造会社』だったんです。
ここでは、生きた人間の外皮を剥いで、そこへ剥ぎたてのヒヒ（猿）の皮を着せて、その上をぐるぐると布切れで巻いてしまうとか、同年代の男女の背中の皮をそれぞれ剥いて、この二人を背中合わせにくっつけて、ギリギリと縛りつけて暗黒の蔵の中へ叩き込んでおくとか、あるいは五、六歳の子供の胴体へ鋼鉄製の箱を着せて、十年間も二十年間もそのままにしておいて『蜘蛛男』や『蜘蛛女』を作るとか、また同様に、胴体や手足の発育を鉄製の箱で奪ってしまって、頭部のみ異常に発育させて『瓢助（ひょうすけ）』を作ったりしているのです。
あたしは、こんなにされてしまったんです。
つまり、両足の内側の皮や肉を適度に削り取って、両足先がちょうど魚の尾に見えるように、削り取った面と面とをくっつけて、ギリギリとその上を縛られて、しかも塩水をぶっかけられて、闇の蔵の中へ叩き込まれたんです。
その蔵の中には、色々な動物――ええ、人間じゃありません。自由自在に変形された動物が、猛烈な痛みと全身を縛られている不自由のために、呻き、のたうち、怒号していました。
『蜘蛛』にされる人間。全身へ角質皮を移植された人間。背と背をくっつけられた二匹の動物、そして数匹の人魚。
それが一日に一度、拳骨ほどの握り飯を与えられ、腐りそうな動物には強度の塩水をぶっかけて――月日が過ぎていくんです。
そのうち、呻きも、のたうちも怒号も次第に下火になって、しかし傷口が治ったからではなく、みんな疼痛に麻痺していくか、ゴロリゴロリと死んでいくんです。
この動物のうち、一つ完成されれば十分な利益が上がるそうですもの。死んでいく者のことなんか、なんとも思いやしないんです。
さて、あたしです。五人の人魚のうち、三人は死亡して、二人だけ出来上がりました。しかし出来上がった二人のうち、私は出来損ないだったんです。実を言うと、膝の上八寸ほど、両側がぴったり密着しなければならないのに、あたしのはその五寸ほどが離れたまま完成されてしまったんです。
『こいつはダメだ、潰してしまえ』
私の肉体を調べた男は言いました。
『待て待て、出来損ないも面白いぜ。こいつを上海やパリの窟（あな）へ出してみろ。情欲を濁し尽くした大尽（だいじん）様方は、ひょっとするとこんなのを好むかもしれねえぜ――。
どうだい、実（身）は入っているし、美しい。こいつが相手の体の周りをのたうち回れば、グロ・サービス百パーセントだぜ』
もう一人の男が言ったんです。
『なるほど。野郎は出来損なっても金になるのう。ウハハハ』
こうして、あたしは一週間前に、この家に売られてきたんです」
と由紀子は語り終えました。そこで、僕は尋ねたんです。
「しかしだね、君。どういうわけで君を僕のような無一文の客へ、この家では出したのかね？ 僕は車夫に連れ込まれたふりの客なんだよ」
「この家では、どんな腹積もりであなたへ私を出したのか、私にも分かりませんわ――。きっと、この家では、私という道具がどれほどの効果を発揮するか試すつもりなのかもしれませんわ」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
The electric lamp began to flicker.
"You—"
Suddenly, the girl called me.
"I am a mermaid failure... "
She began to cry hysterically.
I, [thinking] "could it be?" regarding this beautiful girl,
because I thought [that],
"What thing [are you talking about], eh?"
I said, not even [really] asking. Then,
the girl raised her sleeping upper body and with her white hands
abruptly removed the blanket that was covering [her].
"Please look!"
The girl, looking sad, [said]
"Look, it is a mermaid. A failed mermaid it is."
And, forcibly grasping my hand,
she placed her limb there. It was hot.
After a while, looking up at me intently,
"I, tonight, for the first time was sent out to a guest room,"
[she said] and, putting her hands together, shook her head.
Tears in her moist eyes, perhaps due to the sea-carmine light,
were shining like rubies.

3. Deformed Animal Manufacturing Factory

"You, how old are you?"
"Eighteen."
"Name?"
"Yukiko—I am called Yukiko Hosokawa."
Then, the girl—Yukiko, truly
becoming friendly with me, told various things to me.
When I, after that,
asked "Is your birthplace one place [somewhere]?"
she began to tell in detail about her strange, mysterious life story, no, the bizarre
"Deformed Animal Manufacturing Factory."
"My place of birth doesn't matter, right? I, after being born, for thirteen
years, lived happily together with my parents and siblings. That was [until] that terrible war—
and, we five parents and children, our life or death unknown,
became scattered and separated. I, who became all alone, since anyway if I didn't ruin my body, I couldn't live, right?
I resolved to become a prostitute. Yes, in order to receive rice [food],
falling [into ruin] was not shameful at all, I believed—
However, the place I was sold to, making various deformed things, and to the corners of the world
exporting [them], was a Deformed Animal Manufacturing Company gaining enormous profits.
Here, peeling the outer skin of living humans, and there, putting on freshly peeled baboon skin, and over that wrapping [them] around with scraps of cloth,
or peeling the back skin of a male and female of the same age respectively, and putting these two
back-to-back, sticking them together, and binding them tightly and throwing them into a pitch-black warehouse,
or on five- or six-year-old children's torsos, putting on steel boxes, for ten years,
twenty years, leaving them as they are
to make 'Spider Men' or 'Spider Women,'
or similarly, robbing the growth of the torso and limbs with iron
boxes, causing only the head to grow abnormally to make 'Hyosuke' [gourds] is what they do.
I was made into this.
In other words, the skin and flesh of the inside of both legs being moderately carved out, so that the tips of both feet exactly look like a fish's tail, the carved surfaces were stuck together, and over that bound tightly, and moreover having salt water splashed on,
[I] was thrown into the dark warehouse.
Inside that warehouse, various animals—
yes, not humans. Animals transformed freely, because of intense pain and
the lack of freedom from having the whole body bound,
were groaning, writhing, and shouting.
Humans being made into 'Spiders.' Humans having keratinous skin transplanted to the whole body. Two animals having their backs stuck together, and several mermaids.
Once a day, they are given a fist-sized rice ball, and for the rotting animals, high-strength salt water is splashed—and the days and months pass.
Eventually, the groans, the writhing, and the shouting gradually subside, but not because the wounds healed,
everyone either becomes paralyzed by the pain or dies with a 'gorori gorori' [thud].
Among these animals, if one is completed, it seems a sufficient profit is made, so about those who die, they don't think anything at all.
Now, [about] me. Among five mermaids,
three died, and only two were completed. However, of the two that were completed, I was a failure. To tell the truth, about eight inches above the knee, both sides must adhere perfectly, but
mine remained separated by about five inches when it was completed.
'This one is no good, crush it [dispose of it],'
the man who examined my body said.
'Wait, wait, even a failure is interesting. Won't we send this one to the dens of Shanghai or Paris? Those wealthy lords who have exhausted their lust might just like this kind of thing—
How about it? The meat is in there, it's beautiful, and if this one writhes around the partner's body, it's 100 percent Guro-Service.'
Another man said.
'Indeed, the brat, even if botched, will become money. Uhahaha.'
In this way, I, one week ago,
was sold to this house,"
Yukiko finished telling. So, I asked:
"But, why did this house send you out to a penniless guest like me? I'm a guest who was just brought in by a rickshaw puller pretending to be [a client]."
"In this house, with what intention they sent me out to you, I don't know either—
Surely, in this house, they might be intending to test how much effect a tool called 'me' can exert."

The electric light began to pulse and flicker.
"Darling—"
Suddenly, the girl called out to me.
"I... I am a botched mermaid..."
She collapsed into a fit of hysterical sobbing. I stared at her, thinking, *How could such a beautiful girl say such a thing?*
"What on earth are you talking about?" I asked, though it was hardly a question.
At that, the girl sat up. With her pale hands, she reached down and violently threw back the blanket that had covered her lower half.
"Look!" she cried, her voice thick with sorrow. "See for yourself? I am a mermaid. A failed, wretched mermaid."
She seized my hand with a desperate force and pressed it against her legs—or what had become of them. They were feverishly hot to the touch.
After a moment, she gazed up at me. "Tonight is the first time they have ever sent me out to a guest room," she whispered, clasping her hands and shaking her head. Tears welled in her eyes, shimmering like rubies in the sea-carmine glow of the lamp.

**III. The Monstrous Animal Factory**

"How old are you?" I asked.
"Eighteen."
"And your name?"
"Yukiko... Yukiko Hosokawa."
From that moment on, Yukiko seemed to take a genuine liking to me. She began to speak of many things. When I asked where she was from, she launched into the harrowing tale of her life—a descent into the bizarre and terrifying history of the "Monstrous Animal Factory."
"Does it even matter where I was born?" she began. "For thirteen years, I lived a happy life with my parents and siblings. Then came that horrific war. My family was torn apart, scattered to the winds, their fates unknown. Left entirely alone, I realized I would have to ruin myself just to survive. I resigned myself to a life on the streets. I believed there was no shame in selling one's body if it meant having a bowl of rice to eat.
But the place I was sold to wasn't a brothel—it was the 'Monstrous Animal Manufacturing Company.' They created all manner of freaks and horrors, exporting them to every corner of the globe for obscene profits.
In that place, they would skin living humans and graft the fresh hide of baboons onto them, binding them in rags. They would take a young man and woman, flay the skin from their backs, and sew them together back-to-back, binding them tight before tossing them into a pitch-black cellar. They would lock five- or six-year-old children inside steel boxes for ten or twenty years, stunting their growth to create 'Spider Men' and 'Spider Women.' They would do the same to create 'Hyosuke'—creatures with withered limbs and unnaturally swollen heads, like human gourds.
That is what they did to me.
They carved away the flesh and skin from the insides of my legs so that my feet would resemble a fish’s tail. They pressed the raw surfaces together, bound them tight, doused me in brine, and threw me into the darkness of that cellar.
The cellar was filled with such 'animals'—though they had once been human. These creatures, deformed according to the whims of their makers, thrashed and screamed in agony, their bodies constricted by their bindings. There were the 'Spiders,' the humans with keratinized skin grafts, the pairs fused back-to-back, and several mermaids.
Once a day, they were tossed a single rice ball the size of a fist. They doused the rotting flesh of the creatures with concentrated salt water. Days turned into months. Eventually, the screaming and thrashing would fade—not because the wounds had healed, but because the victims either became numb to the pain or simply died.
If even one such 'animal' was successfully completed, it yielded enough profit to cover the losses of all the others. They cared nothing for those who died.
As for me... out of five experimental mermaids, three died. Only two survived the process. But I was a failure. Ideally, the legs should have fused perfectly from eight inches above the knee down. Mine remained separated by five inches.
'This one's a dud. Scrap it,' the man who inspected me said.
'Wait, wait,' the other replied. 'Even a botched one has its charms. Why not send her to the dens of Shanghai or Paris? Those wealthy old lechers who have exhausted every normal lust might find her quite to their liking. Just imagine—she's beautiful, and when she writhes around a partner, it’ll be a hundred-percent "Guro-Service."'
'I see your point,' the first man laughed. 'The brat will bring in money even as a failure. Hahaha!'
And so, just a week ago, I was sold to this house."
Yukiko finished her story. I looked at her and asked, "But why did they send you to a penniless guest like me? I’m just a man who was dragged in by a rickshaw puller—I can't even pay."
"I don't know what they’re thinking," she replied. "Perhaps they simply want to see how effective a 'tool' like me can be."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Typography and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left. The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing.
*   **Structure:** The page features a narrative segment followed by a chapter heading ("III. Deformed Animal Manufacturing Factory"), indicating it is part of a longer serialized story.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The chapter title is centered in the column with more white space, providing a clear break in the narrative.
*   **Linguistic Style:** The text uses a mixture of standard kanji and *hentai-gana* or historical kana usage (e.g., the use of ゝ for repetition). The dialogue is highly gendered, with the female character using "atashi" and "wa" endings, typical of the era's literary depictions of women.
*   **Pulp Aesthetic:** The use of sensationalist language (e.g., "Hysterical," "Guro-Service," "Monstrous Animal") is characteristic of the *kasutori* (pulp) magazine aesthetic, designed to provoke shock and curiosity.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **The Kasutori Era:** The late 1940s in Japan are often called the *Kasutori* period, named after a cheap, low-quality shochu. This era saw an explosion of short-lived, sensationalist magazines that focused on "Ero-Guro Nansensu" (Eroticism, Grotesquerie, and Nonsense).
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** This was a pre-war cultural movement (pioneered by authors like Edogawa Ranpo) that enjoyed a massive resurgence after the war. It focused on the deviant, the bizarre, and the horrific as a form of escapism from the grim reality of post-war poverty.
*   **The "Human Gourd" (Hyosuke):** The text mentions "Hyosuke," a trope in Japanese horror/pulp where humans are physically deformed (often by being kept in jars or boxes) to resemble gourds. This is a recurring theme in Edogawa Ranpo's works (like *The Human Chair* or *The Caterpillar*).
*   **Post-War Trauma:** The protagonist mentions losing her family in "that terrible war." The story uses the physical mutilation of the human body as a dark metaphor for the psychological and social destruction caused by World War II.
*   **International "Dens":** Mentions of Shanghai and Paris reflect the contemporary Japanese view of these cities as centers of decadent, exotic, and often illicit pleasure.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **出来損ない (Dekisokonai):** A failure, a botched job, or a "good-for-nothing." Here, it refers to the surgically failed "mermaid."
*   **売笑婦 (Baishofu):** An archaic/formal term for a prostitute (lit. "selling-smile woman").
*   **奇形 (Kikei):** Deformity or malformation. A central keyword in the "Guro" genre.
*   **大尽 (Daijin):** Historically a very wealthy merchant or big spender, often at pleasure quarters.
*   **グロ・サービス (Guro-Saabisu):** "Guro" is the Japanese abbreviation for "Grotesque." This term suggests a "service" involving grotesque or fetishistic elements.
*   **身上話 (Shinjobanashi):** One's life story or personal history, usually a tragic one told in a melodrama.
*   **緋々の皮 (Hihi no kawa):** "Hihi" refers to a large monkey or baboon from Japanese folklore. Grafting animal skin onto humans is a classic trope of mad science/horror.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Objectification and Dehumanization:** The woman is literally referred to as a "tool" (*dougu*) and an "animal" (*doubutsu*). Her body is a commodity to be manufactured and exported.
*   **The Mutilated Body:** The detailed description of skinning, grafting, and stunting growth reflects a fascination with the boundaries of the human form and the horror of medical experimentation (possibly reflecting anxieties about wartime medical atrocities).
*   **Class and Lust:** The subtext suggests that extreme physical deformity is a niche luxury for the "bored" wealthy, who have exhausted normal sexual pleasures.
*   **Survival vs. Morality:** Yukiko's choice to "ruin her body" to eat reflects the desperate morality of the immediate post-war years (*kyodatsu* state), where survival trumped traditional ethics.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Fiction, Horror, Ero-Guro.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Body Horror, Human Experimentation, Post-war Japan, Exploitation, Mermaids, Torture, Deformity.
