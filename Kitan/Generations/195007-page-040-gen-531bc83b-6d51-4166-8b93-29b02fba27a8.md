## Output

```
This image is a page from a Japanese magazine, likely dating from the late 1940s to early 1950s (early Shōwa period). It appears to be an investigative report or "exposé" detailing common scams and "too good to be true" business opportunities that targeted a population desperate for income during the post-war reconstruction period.

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"...give you," is the story. Do not speak jokes, even first-rate magazines are a mountain of leftover copies they say, yet can such a three-penny magazine sell? I was amazed and the second word would not follow (speechless).
"So, is this magazine on a consignment system?"
When I teased him,
"No, it is a twenty-five yen cash wholesale,"
he answered like water on a frog's face (unfazed). Good grief, showing respect to his hairy, super-sized heart (brazenness), I took my leave.

**B: What is "Stable Living for Correspondence Members"?**

This time Joto Ward, Imafuku Town. A mimeograph shop called XX Company in the back of an alley. Looking at me suspiciously, he gave me a flimsy mimeographed postcard: "Please write the addresses of your acquaintances on the front and send them out. If an order comes, I will give a reward of twenty yen per case."
Turning it over: "Correspondence Member Stable Living Instruction Manual: 100 Yen Required," exactly like the newspaper advertisement I saw. In the end, it is a story that if I write the addresses and my acquaintances send 100 yen to the HQ XX Company, they will give me 20 yen. The goal is to make people send 100 yen one after another in a round-robin, and in reality, no business is being done.
"If 20 replies come in one day, it's 400 yen; in one month you will easily exceed 10,000 yen."
Indeed, just as said. However, for me to earn that much, I would definitely need 500 acquaintances who would send 100 yen.
Such side-jobs that make a fool of the world exist. Amazed, I said goodbye.

**C: Monthly Income 15,000 Yen with Small Capital?**

Next is near the Osaka Theater in Minami Ward. A sign for the "XX Rehabilitation Association" or something was hanging under the eaves of a coffee shop.
"Ours is a very certain side-job for ladies, having them knit socks."
"What is this 'skill acquisition'?"
"If you buy a sock knitting machine, I will give you practical guidance for ten days."
"Heh? How much is the machine?"
"14,000 yen for one unit, accessories are 1,680 yen."
"Hmm, guidance is of course free, I suppose."
"No, I receive 1,000 yen for ten days."
"...?"
"When you join, for the time being, you first pay 11,000 yen."
"So about how much can one earn here?"
"Since we supply the material yarn, it is processing wages, but 200–300 yen per dozen. If you become skilled, three dozen a day is easy."
Don't make me laugh; isn't that just being forced to buy a machine to do subcontracted side-work? Paying 15,000 yen as an offering and barely making 300 yen a day—the abacus doesn't balance (the math doesn't work)!
Advantageous side-jobs in newspaper ads are "Heaven to hear, Hell to see." I warn the overly honest country people that most are fakes similar to the three examples above.
Even with such obvious fakes, because they make enough profit to pay high advertising fees, the "seeds of fools" in the world never run out.

(In illustration: Monthly Income 30,000 Yen)

**4. The Back Side of Panske Agencies and Marriage Agencies**

"Many young ladies and widows, waiting for the support of understanding gentlemen."
"Seeking an heir with a million in wealth."
"Seeking companionship."
"First marriage, remarriage as desired."
These ads are in a bustling "no-room-to-push" state in third-rate newspapers, no less than the "side-jobs." If the side-jobs lure with money, these admire-worthy souls lure with sex/color.
Dressing like an "understanding gentleman," I visited one of those ads, the XX Society in Juso, Higashiyodogawa Ward, Osaka City. Behind some movie theater. Opening the rattling lattice door of a house like a dirty boarding house, a bald old man like a pawnshop clerk, tapping his pipe against a ceramic brazier, immediately brought me up to a six-tatami room.
Since they call themselves a "Marriage Introduction," I was worried about the need for family register copies or resumes, but without touching on those at all, while rubbing his hands together:
"What kind of girl would be good for you? Heh heh."
I was surprised at how he understood everything (implicitly).
"Well, a younger one is better, you know what I mean, Pa..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"...and that's how it's done."
"Don't give me that," I retorted. "Even top-tier magazines are piling up as unsold returns these days. You expect me to believe a cheap rag like this is selling? I was so stunned I couldn't find my voice.
"So, is this magazine on consignment?" I asked mockingly.
"Not at all," he replied, thick-skinned as they come. "It's twenty-five yen per copy, cash up front." Unfazed, he stood his ground. I had to tip my hat to his sheer brass—the man had a heart with hair on it—before I beat a hasty retreat.

**Section B: The "Stable Income for Correspondence Members" Scam**

My next stop was Imafuku-cho in Joto Ward. Tucked away in the back of an alley was a mimeograph shop called "XX & Co." The proprietor eyed me suspiciously as he handed over a flimsy, poorly printed postcard. "Just write down the addresses of anyone you know on the front and mail them out," he said. "For every order we get, I’ll pay you twenty yen."
I flipped the card over. There it was, in the same font as the newspaper ad: "Instruction Manual for Stable Living as a Correspondence Member: 100 Yen." The scam was simple: I provide the leads, my friends send 100 yen to the "headquarters," and I get a 20-yen kickback. It was a classic pyramid scheme—no actual business was being conducted; the only goal was to keep those 100-yen payments circulating.
"If you get twenty replies a day, that's four hundred yen," he chirped. "You'll easily clear ten thousand a month."
Technically true, I suppose. But for me to make that kind of money, I’d need five hundred friends willing to throw away 100 yen. It’s astounding that such blatant swindles exist. Disgusted, I bid him farewell.

**Section C: 15,000 Yen a Month on a Small Investment?**

Next, I headed to Minami Ward near the Osaka Theater. A sign for something called the "XX Rehabilitation Association" was dangling from the eaves of a cafe.
"We offer a very reliable home-based job for ladies—knitting socks," the man told me.
"And what's this 'skill acquisition' mentioned in the ad?" I asked.
"If you purchase one of our knitting machines, we provide ten days of hands-on training."
"I see. And what does a machine cost?"
"Fourteen thousand yen for the unit, plus sixteen hundred and eighty for accessories."
"I assume the training is free?"
"Actually, we charge one thousand yen for the ten days."
"Come again?"
"Essentially, we require an initial deposit of eleven thousand yen when you sign up."
"And how much can a person actually earn?"
"We provide the yarn. It's piecework, paying two to three hundred yen per dozen. Once you're skilled, you can easily knock out three dozen a day."
Give me a break. It's nothing but a scheme to sell overpriced machines to women looking for side-work. Paying fifteen thousand yen just for the "privilege" of earning three hundred yen a day? The math just doesn't add up.
These "lucrative home jobs" advertised in the papers are truly "Heaven in the telling, Hell in the doing." I’m warning you honest folks from the countryside: most of them are scams exactly like these three. Yet, as long as these crooks make enough profit to pay for expensive ads, the supply of fools in this world will never run dry.

(Illustration caption: Monthly Income: 30,000 Yen)

**Section 4: The Underworld of "Panske" and Marriage Agencies**

"Many young ladies and widows seeking the support of understanding gentlemen."
"Seeking heir for a million-yen fortune."
"Seeking companionship."
"First or second marriages, all requests considered."
These advertisements are packed into the back pages of third-rate newspapers, rivaling the "home-job" ads in sheer density. While the job scams lure you with money, these prey on lust—a truly terrifying tactic.
Disguising myself as one of those "understanding gentlemen," I visited one of the advertisers: the "XX Society" in Juso, Higashiyodogawa Ward. It was tucked behind a movie theater in a house that looked like a dilapidated boarding house. When I opened the creaky lattice door, a bald man who looked like a pawnshop clerk was busy tapping his pipe against a ceramic brazier. He immediately ushered me into a six-tatami room.
Since they billed themselves as a marriage agency, I’d worried they might ask for family registers or resumes. Instead, the man just rubbed his hands together with a greasy grin.
"So, what kind of girl are you looking for? Heh heh."
I was shocked by how quickly he dropped the act.
"Well," I said, "I'd prefer someone on the younger side. You know what I mean, pops... a 'pan'..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** This is a classic example of "Kasutori" (pulp) journalism from the post-war era. The layout is dense, utilizing vertical text across several columns. Sections are clearly demarcated with bold headers labeled "B," "C," and "四" (4).
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of Kyūjitai (traditional kanji) and Shinjitai (modern kanji), which was common during the transition period after WWII. The use of circles (〇〇) to redact or anonymize names of companies is a standard journalistic convention in Japan to avoid libel or because the "investigation" is partially fictionalized or generalized.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Bold headers and numbered sections help guide the reader through different "case studies" of scams.
*   **Illustration:** The caricature in the middle depicts a man being tempted by a person holding a large fish (symbolizing a "big catch" or bait) with a speech bubble promising a monthly income of 30,000 yen—an exorbitant amount for the time. The man's wide-eyed expression conveys the "greed" or "hope" that these scams prey upon.
*   **Design Features:** The use of "quotes" for dialogue makes the investigative reporting feel like a first-hand narrative or a detective story, increasing its entertainment value.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Reconstruction (Late 1940s):** Japan was suffering from extreme inflation, unemployment, and housing shortages. Many people, especially repatriated soldiers and housewives, were desperate for any source of income, leading to a boom in "naishoku" (side-jobs at home).
*   **Naishoku Scams:** The text describes "job-offering scams" (内職商法 - *naishoku shōhō*). Scammers would sell expensive equipment (like knitting machines) or "instruction manuals" with the false promise of providing consistent work or commissions.
*   **"Panske" (パンスケ):** This is a slang term derived from "Pan-pan girls," which referred to streetwalkers who catered primarily to the US Occupation forces. "Panske" usually referred to lower-tier streetwalkers or those working through shady "introduction agencies" that were fronts for prostitution.
*   **Mimeographs (謄写版 - Tōshaba):** Before photocopiers, small-scale printing was done via mimeograph. These machines were cheap and portable, making them the tool of choice for scammers to print flyers and postcards in bulk.
*   **Currency Value:** In 1948–1950, a typical monthly salary for a government worker was around 3,000 to 5,000 yen. Therefore, the promise of 15,000 or 30,000 yen (as shown in the illustration) was an incredible, albeit suspicious, amount.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **三文誌 (Sanmon-shi):** Literally "three-penny magazine." A derogatory term for low-quality, cheap pulp magazines (Kasutori magazines).
*   **二の句がつげない (Ni no ku ga tsugenai):** An idiom meaning to be "speechless" or "at a loss for words," usually out of amazement or disgust.
*   **蛙の面に小便 (Kaeru no tsura ni shōben):** Literally "pissing on a frog's face." It means to be completely unfazed or thick-skinned, like water sliding off a frog.
*   **毛の生えた心臓 (Ke no haeta shinzō):** Literally "a heart with hair growing on it." A metaphor for someone who is exceptionally brazen, shameless, or nervy.
*   **たらい回し (Taraimawashi):** To pass something (like a responsibility or, in this case, money) around in a circle or from person to person without actual progress.
*   **聞いて極楽、見て地獄 (Kiite gokuraku, mite jigoku):** "Heaven to hear of, Hell to see." A phrase used for things that sound wonderful in a pitch but are terrible in reality.
*   **ボロ儲け (Boro-mōke):** Making "easy money" or "huge profits" with little effort, often through shady means.
*   **揉手 (Momite):** Rubbing one's hands together, a gesture often associated with sycophancy, greed, or a sleazy salesman.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Anti-Scam Warning:** The primary theme is a warning to the "honest countryside folk" (*shōjiki-sugiru chihō no hitobito*) who might be naive enough to believe advertisements in "three-penny" newspapers.
*   **Skepticism and Cynicism:** The narrator maintains a very cynical, "street-smart" tone. He presents himself as an investigator who can't be fooled, contrasting his wit with the "shameless" nature of the scammers.
*   **Social Desperation:** Beneath the humorous or mocking tone is the stark reality of post-war poverty. People were so desperate for a "stable life" (*seikatsu antei*) that they were willing to risk their meager savings on a 100-yen manual or a 14,000-yen machine.
*   **Moral Decay:** The transition from discussing job scams to "marriage agencies" (prostitution fronts) suggests a general sense of moral decay in the urban centers like Osaka (Juso, Minami Ward). The scammers "lure with money," while the agencies "lure with sex."
