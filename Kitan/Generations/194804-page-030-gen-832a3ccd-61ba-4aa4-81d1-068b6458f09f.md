**閨房殺人事件**
**杉山清道**

（一）
河原町裏に華開くカフェ「ひなどり」は、夕方からの小糠雨のせいだろうか、まだ客らしい客もなく、黙りこくつている電蓄の側で、女給達は無遠慮に欠伸を放つたり、喋まない無駄話を煙草に紛らわしたりしていた。
　マダムは面倒臭そうな手付きで、カウンターに拡げたトランプをいぢくつていた。
「詩子さん、今夜あたりに彼氏が来るといいのにね、ゆっくり裏の二階へでも案内してたまには帯も解いてみたいでしょう。」
「嫌なマダム、お客さんなら妾、これでも處女よと言う所なんだけど、マダムにはネタを掴まれているから大きな事も言えないわね。でも佐崎さんにはそこまで氣が進まないの。ひなどりの詩子はそう簡単にグロースを脱ぐような安淫賣ぢゃございませんツて。」
「隨分氣前の良い啖呵を切つたわね、でも、まんざらそこでもないんでしょ。それにあの人なら悪くないわよ。うちのお客さんでは上出来の部よ。酔えば悪戯するけど、金はあっても無闇な使い方ももしないし。案外純情で眞面目な所もあるぢゃないの、男前なら申分ないし、私ならもう十年若かつたら惚れてるわ。今夜来るか来ないか占つてあげましょうか？」
「もう澤山、アーア、妾も早くこんな商賣から足を洗つて、どつかへ眞面目にお嫁に行きたいわ。どうせ男を知らない女ぢゃないもの、生意氣な事は望まないけど、裏町で手鍋さげても、堅氣の人に貰つてもらえたら幸せだと思わわ」
「おやおや、嫌にしめつぽくなつたわね、河原町界隈ぢゃ知る人に知られたひなどりの詩子ちゃんが、とんだ弱音、一体今夜はどうしたのよォー」
「うふん、何でもないの、ふと、昔が戀しくなつただけ。」
虚無的な煙草の煙が、淋しくシャンデリアの蔭へ昇天してゆく。「今度はありし日のおのろけ？ねえー」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Chamber Murder Incident**
**Sugiyama Seidō**

(1)
In the back of Kawaramachi, the blooming Cafe "Hinadori" (Fledgling), perhaps because of the drizzling rain since evening, still had no guest-like guests; by the side of the silent electric gramophone, the waitresses were unreservedly letting out yawns or distracting themselves from endless idle talk with cigarettes.
The Madam, with a bothered-looking hand movement, was fiddling with cards spread on the counter.
"Utako-san, it would be good if your boyfriend came around tonight, wouldn't it? You'd probably like to guide him to the second floor in the back and occasionally untie your obi (sash)."
"Nasty Madam. If it were a customer, I would say, 'I am a virgin even so,' but since you have the dirt on me, I can't say big things. But with Sazaki-san, I don't feel like going that far. Utako of 'Hinadori' is not a cheap prostitute who would take off her clothes so easily."
"You certainly cut a generous boast. But, it's not entirely like that, is it? Besides, if it's that man, he's not bad. Among our customers, he's in the top tier. He plays pranks when drunk, but even though he has money, he doesn't spend it recklessly. He has a surprisingly pure and serious side, doesn't he? As for his looks, there's nothing to complain about; if I were ten years younger, I'd fall for him. Shall I divine whether he'll come tonight or not?"
"Enough already. Ah, I want to wash my hands of this business soon and go somewhere to be a serious bride. I'm not a woman who doesn't know men anyway, so I don't desire cheeky things, but even if I have to carry a hand-pot in the back alleys, if a straight-laced person would take me, I think I'd be happy."
"Oh my, you've become awfully damp (gloomy). Utako-chan of 'Hinadori,' known by those who know her in the Kawaramachi area, giving such a pathetic whine. What on earth is wrong with you tonight?"
"Ufun (sigh), it's nothing. I just suddenly became nostalgic for the past."
Nihilistic cigarette smoke lonely ascends toward the shadow of the chandelier. "Next, a boast about the old days? Hey—"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Bedchamber Murder**
**by Seidō Sugiyama**

(1)
The "Hinadori" cafe, tucked away in the backstreets of Kawaramachi, was in full bloom—though perhaps due to the steady drizzle since dusk, not a single soul resembling a customer had appeared. Beside a silent gramophone, the waitresses yawned without apology, their endless, aimless chatter drifting away with the smoke of their cigarettes.
At the counter, the Madam listlessly shuffled a deck of playing cards.
"Utako, wouldn't it be nice if your fellow showed up tonight? I'm sure you'd love to lead him up to that quiet room on the second floor and let him loosen your sash for once."
"Oh, hush, Madam. If it were a customer, I’d play the blushing virgin, but you know too much of my business for me to talk big. Still, I just can't bring myself to go that far with Sazaki. I’m not some cheap streetwalker who'd drop her clothes at the drop of a hat."
"Listen to you and your grand talk! But you don't entirely mean it, do you? He’s not a bad sort. Best of the lot we get in here. He gets a bit frisky when he’s had a few, but he’s got money and he doesn't throw it away foolishly. He’s surprisingly sincere, even earnest. And he's handsome to boot. If I were ten years younger, I’d be smitten myself. Shall I read the cards and see if he's coming?"
"Enough, Madam. Honestly, I just want to wash my hands of this life and find a decent man to marry. I'm no innocent, so I don't expect the world, but even a humble life in a back alley would be heaven if it were with an honest, straight-laced man."
"Goodness, aren't we feeling melancholy? To hear the famous Utako of Kawaramachi whimpering like this... what’s gotten into you tonight?"
"Mmm... it’s nothing. I just felt a sudden pang for the old days."
Listless curls of cigarette smoke rose toward the shadows of the chandelier like ghosts. "What's next?" the Madam teased. "Nostalgic tales of your glory days?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** Standard vertical Japanese layout (top-to-bottom, right-to-left). The page is dominated by a central illustration, with text wrapped around it.
*   **Typography:** The title uses a heavy, blocky font typical of mystery or crime novels of the era. The body text is a standard serif typeface.
*   **Illustration:** A suggestive line drawing features a reclining woman in a state of undress (or sheer clothing). A hand holding a pistol is visible in the upper right corner, clearly establishing the "Murder" element of the title. The style is reminiscent of 1950s "low-brow" entertainment magazines.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and illustration immediately grab the reader's attention, while the text provides the atmospheric "hook" before the plot begins.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** Likely the late 1940s to mid-1950s. This was the era of *kasutori* magazines—cheap, pulp publications that focused on "3S" (Sex, Screen, and Sport) and "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense).
*   **Cafe Culture:** The "Cafe" (カフェ) mentioned is not a modern coffee shop but a "Cafe Waitress" (女給 - *jokyū*) establishment. These were bars where waitresses provided flirtatious service, often bordering on or including sex work. 
*   **Kawaramachi:** A famous district in Kyoto, known then (and now) for its nightlife and entertainment.
*   **Social Conventions:** The dialogue reflects the post-war struggle. The waitress Utako expresses a common trope of the era: the desire to "wash one's hands" of the entertainment industry and become a *katagi* (straight-laced/honest) housewife.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **小糠雨 (Konuka-ame):** A fine, misty drizzle. Literally "rice-bran rain."
*   **電蓄 (Denchiku):** Abbreviation for *denki chikusonki* (electric gramophone). A luxury item that sets the scene's atmosphere.
*   **グロース (Gurōsu):** This is likely a loanword. In this context, it may refer to a "girdle" or "clothes" (a misspelling/mispronunciation of "clothes" as *kurōsu*). Given the context of "taking it off," it refers to her undergarments or attire.
*   **手鍋さげても (Tenabe sagete mo):** A classic idiom meaning "even if we are poor." It literally refers to a woman carrying her own cooking pot because she can't afford servants. It signifies a humble but honest marriage.
*   **堅氣 (Katagi):** An honest person; someone who earns a living through a "respectable" trade, as opposed to the "floating world" of gambling or nightlife.
*   **しめっぽく (Shimeppoku):** Literally "damp" or "wet," but used here to mean "gloomy," "sentimental," or "melancholy."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Nihilism (Kyomu):** The text explicitly mentions "nihilistic smoke" (虚無的な煙草). This was a major theme in post-war literature (the *Buraiha* school), reflecting the aimlessness and despair of the defeated nation.
*   **The Fallen Woman with a Heart of Gold:** Utako is depicted as a cynical waitress who nevertheless harbors a "pure" desire for a normal life. This creates a sympathetic character before the "murder" (presumably) occurs.
*   **Contrast of Setting:** The "blooming" cafe vs. the "drizzling rain" and "silent gramophone" creates a sense of loneliness and fading glamour.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Mystery, Ero-Guro.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Nightlife, Melancholy, Crime, Romance, Kyoto.
*   **Classification:** Adult (due to suggestive themes/illustration).
