Title:
The Secret Society of the Metropolis
The Second Floor of the Social Café
FUJI Kinji

The peculiarities of the metropolis, when investigated by an unexpected talent for extraction/discovery in places one would never think possible, show that there are such locations.
There are places that possess truly strong hearts and, so they say, do not hold within their cores the records pertaining to those secrets—friends sick with heart disease—and these locations were reported and included by the crowd of ghost stories who operated under the name of the Greater East Asia Exchange Club or International Peace.
Sitting at the innermost box seat, drinking coffee, there were young women whose hair was utterly stiff with pomade, and it was stated as "The second floor is reserved." It felt suspicious that the manager who rents out the second floor of a café would act like a manager, and the customers who rent it would act like customers. He paid attention and saw that gentlemen, behaving as such, who had come through some kind of introduction, were actively engaging there.
There were only men with the faces of directors from the four faces/sides of a pagoda. The words, "An introduction from So-and-so,"
From Etsuko, there were pure tears, even though she was a daughter who had been uncontrollable until now. She spoke towards his already invisible retreating figure:
"I swear I will never do anything bad again, surely, surely! This time, I will become a good daughter that Mr. Kamogawa can praise. Please, don't abandon me."
After finishing her speech, when she stepped outside, she saw a lukewarm wind caressing her skin, stroking it.
(End)

[Continuation from Left Column - Mid-Dialogue]
...because you are doing that, you end up in such situations. I will call your school teacher and your father in the meantime."
"I'm sorry, I won't cause trouble like this a second time. I will become a good daughter, so please forgive me."
Etsuko's cry was truly one of repentance. Her voice was choked up, and she was weeping deeply.
"That's the moment."
I said this to her during a previous incident, but now I don't feel like doing it. It would be pitiful to subject Etsuko's beautiful body to a detailed inspection just to brand her as Hisako's sister, a mark of humiliation.
"I said so, but I will abandon the lead of the armed police squad and go straight to the headquarters."
"Wait,"
He stopped her again with a loud voice. He said, however, that this woman was the current man named Kajii, a heinous murderer who had committed armed robbery and murder, stealing three million yen in cash. At the same time, there was also a theory that she was Etsuko's aunt, and the sister of the woman who was killed as a victim in the same incident.
"But please stop threatening her so unreasonably."
"I swear I will never do anything bad again, surely, surely! This time, I will become a good daughter that Mr. Kamogawa can praise. Please, don't abandon me."
He said so, and then, just like that, he vanished suddenly into the darkness, but Etsuko felt a new tear trickle down her cheek due to a certain sense of inadequate emptiness.

Title:
The Secret Society of the Metropolis
The Second Floor of the Social Café
By Kinji Fuji

Urban peculiarity, it turns out, consists of unexpected artifacts, uncovered by a keen investigative eye in places one would never suspect.
There are establishments that possess truly robust facades—and, as their sickly-hearted patrons claim, hold no emotional records of their secrets—which were reported and folded into the "ghost stories" circulated by those operating under the banner of the Greater East Asia Exchange Club or International Peace.
Sitting in the innermost booth, sipping coffee, I observed young women whose stiff, pomaded hair suggested a certain profession, and the floor was designated "Second Floor Reserved." It seemed suspect that the café manager renting the second floor was truly just a manager, and the clients renting it were just clients. Paying closer attention, I saw well-dressed gentlemen, acting every bit the part of the elite, who had arrived through private introductions, engaging actively in business.
The men only had the weighty, directorial faces befitting the four corners of a high tower. The password, "An introduction from So-and-so,"

Etsuko, despite being a daughter who had been uncontrollable until now, wept tears of genuine purity. She called out to his already invisible departing back:
"I promise I will never do anything wrong again, truly! This time, I will become a good girl worthy of Mr. Kamogawa’s praise. Please, don't abandon me."
When she finished speaking and stepped outside, a warm, moist wind swept across her skin, caressing her gently.
(The End)

[Continuation from Left Column - Mid-Dialogue]
...since you behave that way, you face these consequences. I will summon your school teacher and your father in the meantime."
"I apologize, I won't let this happen a second time. I promise to become a good daughter, please forgive me."
Etsuko’s cry was genuinely one of repentance. Her voice was choked, and she was weeping miserably.
"That’s the moment."
I had said that to her during a previous incident, but now I hesitate. It seems too cruel to subject Etsuko's beautiful body to a detailed inspection just to brand her with the mark of humiliation as Hisako’s sister.
"Even though I said that, I will forgo leading the armed police squad and proceed directly to headquarters."
"Wait!"
He strongly stopped her again with a loud voice. He explained that this woman was actually the current identity of Kajii, a heinous murderer who had committed armed robbery and murder, stealing three million yen in cash. Simultaneously, there was also a theory that she was Etsuko's aunt, the sister of the woman killed as a victim in the same incident.
"However, please stop these overly unreasonable threats."
"I swear I will never do anything bad again, surely, surely! This time, I will become a good daughter that Mr. Kamogawa can praise. Please, don't abandon me."
He said this, and then, suddenly, he slipped away into the darkness. Etsuko, however, felt a new tear tracing her cheek, a tear born of a certain sense of inadequate emptiness.

## Editorial Analysis

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Section Type** | Investigative Reportage (探訪/Reportage), heavily disguised as quasi-fiction (often termed 'jitsuwa fiction' or 'true-story fiction' in this genre). |
| **Title** | 都の秘密の会 社交喫茶の二階 (The Secret Society of the Metropolis: The Second Floor of the Social Café) |
| **Author Attribution** | 富士欣二 (Fuji Kinji). Likely a pseudonym used for sensational reporting, suggesting the writer is uncovering urban secrets. |
| **Narrative Voice (Right Column)** | Cynical, authoritative, investigative first-person (implied reporter/detective). Focuses on observation, euphemisms, and the hidden structures of vice. |
| **Narrative Voice (Left Column)** | Dialogue-heavy, dramatic third-person focused on an emotional climax, likely the conclusion of a blackmail or coercion plot. The speaker "I" (私) in the dialogue is the blackmailer/coercer. |
| **Target Audience** | Urban male readers interested in high-society scandal, sex, and crime; typical *Kitan Club* demographic seeking sensational exposure of taboo subjects. |
| **Positioning** | A central feature meant to expose a specific location (the "Social Café") as a nexus for illicit meetings, likely positioned early in the magazine for maximum impact. |

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

1.  **"社交喫茶の二階" (Second Floor of the Social Café):** *Shakō Kissaten* (Social Cafés) were common euphemisms in postwar Japan for meeting places that facilitated sexual encounters, often acting as fronts for discreet prostitution rings or *aidan* (appointment dating) services, especially catering to businessmen and elite clientele. The "reserved second floor" (二階貸切) explicitly marks this as a space for private, illicit transactions or encounters, away from the public eye.
2.  **"都の奇/秘密" (Peculiarities/Secrets of the Metropolis):** This framing is a classic trope in Japanese urban pulp fiction and reportage, following the tradition of exposing the hidden, corrupt underbelly of modern Tokyo/Osaka. It appeals to the voyeuristic interest in high-class depravity.
3.  **"大東亜交驩倶楽部" (Greater East Asia Exchange Club):** This reference is highly significant. The term "Greater East Asia" (Daitō-A) directly links back to Imperial Japan's wartime ideology. Using this name for a club suggests either: a) a satirical critique of old power structures masking new vice, or b) an establishment catering to former elites, military, or right-wing figures who still idealized the old empire, using the patriotic name as a cover for hedonism. This strongly roots the text in the *postwar* Showa context (1945 onwards).
4.  **"雷の堅い毛だらけの小娘" (Young woman with hair utterly stiff with pomade):** This description, particularly using *kaminari* (雷 - lightning/thunder) to describe the stiffness or rigidity (堅い) of the hair (likely a specific, dated style achieved with heavy pomade/oil), is a visual marker for girls working in the entertainment/sex industry or those trying to appear excessively "modern" or tough.
5.  **"三百万圓" (Three million yen):** Mentioning this large sum (in the context of the 1940s/50s, this would be a substantial fortune) emphasizes the severity of the crime (murder/robbery) and the high stakes of the blackmail plot, linking sex/shame directly to extreme financial transgression.
6.  **"屈辱のしるしを付ける" (To brand with a mark of humiliation):** This phrase, used in the context of a "detailed inspection" (精密の検査), heavily implies sexual coercion, physical examination, or branding (either metaphorical or literal, given the extreme content common in *Kitan Club*) tied to the victim's identity (as the sister of another victim, Hisako). This establishes a clear power dynamic based on sexual vulnerability and shame.

## Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

| Term (Original) | Modern Reading | Meaning/Context | Historical Nuance / Euphemism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 都の奇 | みやこのあやし | The Metropolis's Peculiarity | Used interchangeably with "秘密" (secret) to signal hidden vice/scandal. |
| 摘出物的 | てきしゅつぶつてき | Extractive/discovered material | Pseudo-journalistic term implying the text presents found, raw evidence of vice. |
| 交驩倶楽部 | こうかんくらぶ | Exchange/Goodwill Club | Euphemism masking illicit activity, likely sexual/political networking. |
| 紳士然 | しんしぜん | Behaving as a gentleman | Ironic description; appearance of high-class respectability covering depravity. |
| 雷の堅い毛 | かみなりのいかたけ | Hair stiff with pomade | Specific, dated description of hairdressing common in certain segments of the service/sex industry. |
| 二階貸切 | にかいかしきり | Second floor reserved | Euphemism for a private, segregated space for illicit meetings or prostitution. |
| 精密の検査 | せいみつのけんさ | Detailed inspection | Euphemism for a sexual examination, potentially forceful or humiliating. |
| 勘忍 | かんにん | Forgiveness/Patience | Archaic way of saying 堪忍 (kannin). |
| 伝う | つたう | To trickle down/along | Used for tears flowing down the cheek (頬を伝う). |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

1.  **Urban Corruption and Voyeurism:** The dominant theme is the exposure of hidden urban vice (the "secret society"). The narrator acts as the detached voyeur/investigator, penetrating the respectable surface (the café) to reveal the corrupt core (the reserved second floor patronized by "directors").
2.  **The Intertwining of Sex, Crime, and Status:** The narrative explicitly links high-stakes financial crime (3 million yen robbery/murder) with sexual coercion and blackmail (Etsuko's shame and the threat of "inspection"). Elite men (重役面の男) are the consumers of this illicit space, emphasizing class hypocrisy.
3.  **Shame and Purification Fantasy:** Etsuko's repetitive plea ("I will become a good daughter... don't abandon me") is a classic trope in ero-guro, where the sexually compromised woman seeks salvation, usually through the (male) authority figure (Mr. Kamogawa). Her repentance, prompted by extreme threat, functions as a form of purification fantasy for the reader, contrasting her "uncontrollable" past with a promised future of moral obedience.
4.  **The Unseen Threat:** The dialogue focuses heavily on potential actions (calling authorities, inspection, branding). The real terror lies in the *threat* of exposure and humiliation, demonstrating the power dynamics inherent in the blackmail scenario. The armed police squad reference adds military/authoritarian weight to the threat.
5.  **Sensual Release:** The final sentence, where the warm wind strokes her skin, acts as a sudden, brief sensual release following intense emotional and sexual pressure. It marks the moment Etsuko transitions from the suffocating interior world of coercion back into the outside world, perhaps highlighting her lingering vulnerability or sexual awakening despite her terror.

## Content Flags (For Downstream Processing)

*   Sexual content: High (Implied sexual encounters, threat of forced sexual inspection/branding).
*   Violence: Medium (Discussion of past murder and armed robbery; implied psychological coercion).
*   Coercion: High (Explicit sexual blackmail, manipulation based on shame and threat of exposure).
*   Medical / bodily themes: Low-Medium (Reference to "detailed inspection" - 精密の検査).
*   Taboo or illegal implications: High (Prostitution/Illicit meetings, Murder, Robbery, Blackmail).
