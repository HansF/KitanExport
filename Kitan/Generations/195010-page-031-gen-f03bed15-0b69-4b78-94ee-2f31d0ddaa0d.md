貰ひはぱつく〜快復していった。丸芳の旦那も今迄になく、朝の散歩時に、折々小遣銭を呉れたりした。丸芳には近頃小さなテリヤ犬を飼つて、そいつが旦那のお供をして、チョロチョロ走り廻つていた。
お絹さんからも何かと貰い物が増えた。もう九月も半ば過ぎて、段々涼しくなるだらうからと、旦那のお古らしいチョッキとズボンを貰つた時、亀は実に嬉しかつた。

（中略）

その日の夜、拾つたビラ券で、亀は新世界で映画を見た。西部劇と云ふのだらう。アメリカの牛飼男が、馬に乗つて走り廻り、矢鱈にピストルを撃ち合ふと云つた筋で、亀は子供のように面白がつた。

（中略）

「亀！　邪魔をさすとこれやぞ！」
虎は片手で拳銃を亀の方へ凝らした。
「何！　撃つなら撃て！　こら！　虎！　御りようさんを放せ！　こら！　放せ！」
「あほめ！　俺の傍へ来やがつたらズドンやぞ！　あつちへ行つとれ！」

（中略）

「亀さん！　しつかりして！」
亀は消えるやうな声で、まだ何かを呟いたが、お絹さんには聞きとれなかつた。
お絹さんはかまわず、亀の頭をその艶な膝へ抱きあげた。亀の草のような顔色の中に、ほのかな笑みが浮かんだが、その儘ぐつたりなつた。
お絹さんの目からホロリ涙が落ちた。　――了――

From Okinu-san's eyes, a single tear fell. --The End--

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
Kame’s health returned with surprising speed. Even the master of the Maruyoshi shop, in a rare display of generosity, would occasionally slip him some pocket money during his morning walks. A small terrier had recently joined the Maruyoshi household; it would scurry about, following the master wherever he went.
His gifts from Okinu-san also grew more frequent. As mid-September passed and the air began to turn crisp, she gave him an old vest and a pair of trousers that had belonged to the master. Kame was overjoyed.

(Later that night...)

That evening, using a promotional ticket he’d found, Kame went to see a movie in Shin-Sekai. It was what they call a "Western." The plot followed American cowboys galloping about on horseback and firing pistols at one another with reckless abandon. Kame watched with the wide-eyed wonder of a child.

(The confrontation...)

"Kame! Get in my way and you’re dead!" Tora barked, leveling his pistol at Kame’s chest.
"Go ahead then, shoot!" Kame shouted back. "Let her go, Tora! Let the lady go!"
"You idiot! Take one step closer and I'll blow you away! Get back!"

(The ending...)

"Kame-san! Stay with me!" Okinu cried.
Kame’s voice was a mere whisper as he tried to speak, but his words were lost to her. Ignoring the blood, Okinu gathered his head into her lap. A faint, peaceful smile flickered across his sallow, pale face before he finally went limp.
A single tear escaped Okinu’s eye and fell upon him.  --FIN--

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a three-column vertical format (*tategaki*), typical of Japanese literary magazines.
*   **Typography:** Uses a traditional Mincho serif typeface. Character spacing is tight, common for mass-market pulps.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "31" is centered at the bottom. The symbol "――了――" (The End) marks the conclusion of the story.
*   **Punctuation:** Includes traditional Japanese quotation marks (「 」), repetition marks (々), and exclamation points. It uses specific onomatopoeia common in pulp fiction, like "ズドン" (Zudon - the sound of a gunshot).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Setting:** Mentions **Shin-Sekai** (New World), a famous entertainment district in Osaka known for its theaters and cinemas. 
*   **Western Influence:** The mention of "Westerns" (*Seibugeki*) and "American cowboys" reflects the surge of American cultural influence in post-WWII Japan (late 1940s–1950s).
*   **The Terrier:** Keeping a "Terrier" as a pet suggests a westernized middle-class or merchant-class household (the Maruyoshi shop), as western dog breeds became status symbols during this era.
*   **Terminology:** The name "Kame" (Turtle) often implies a character who is slow-witted but loyal and sturdy—a classic "underdog" trope.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **チョッキ (Chokki):** Derived from the Portuguese *jaqueta* or English "jacket," it refers to a vest or waistcoat.
*   **ビラ券 (Bira-ken):** A flyer or handbill that doubles as a discount or free entry ticket.
*   **出歯庖丁 (Deba-bōchō):** A heavy kitchen knife mentioned in the text during the fight scene, indicating a desperate, "street-level" brawl.
*   **御りようさん (O-ryō-san / O-jo-san):** A polite way of referring to the daughter of a house or a young lady.
*   **ルンペン (Rumpen):** (Visible in the middle section) From the German *Lumpenproletariat*, used in Japan to describe vagrants or the homeless.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Tragic Heroism:** Kame is portrayed as a simple, perhaps low-status man who finds joy in simple things (a movie, an old vest) and ultimately sacrifices himself for Okinu.
*   **Cinematic Parallels:** The text explicitly mentions Kame watching a Western where people shoot each other. This foreshadows the actual gunfight he becomes involved in, drawing a contrast between the "fun" violence of the screen and the tragic reality of his death.
*   **Class and Loyalty:** The relationship between the "Master," "Okinu-san," and "Kame" suggests a traditional hierarchy of service and unrequited or protective devotion.
