## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

「いゝわ、あたしが立て替えとくから……」
　お帳面がきく。そういう次第でボクはこの酒場において、暫くの間は、眞に恵まれた境遇にあった。
　ボクはその居心地よさに感激して、彼女との肝心かなめの話を進めることを、すら殆んど忘れてしまっていたし、ほんとの事をいうと、なるべく忘れたいと努力した。
　というのは、ボクとしては、この酒場に於ける居心地よさを一時も長く引き伸ばしたかったからに外ならなかった。
　しかし、毎夜お帳面を仰せつかる彼女は、自らボクとは立場が違う。
「あたし、今夜は、あなたにちょっとお話があるの」
「お話があるのよ」
　いよ〜い、手がまわったのかとボクは感じた。
「何の話だい？」
「こんなところでお話し出来るような話じゃないわ、――帰りに待ってゝね」
　とう〜、ボクは釘をさされたが、その夜、
「ホテルなんて勿体ないわ、それよりあたしのアパートへ行らつしやいよ。あたし、あんたにあたしの生活を一度観ておいて貰いたいのよ」
　ときた時には、少なからず驚いたね。そして郊外のさゝやかなアパートの部屋へ連れて行かれて、ガスこんろで沸かしたコーヒーをつゝましく一杯宛飲んでから、白粉の匂いのする女用のパジャマをつんつるてんに着せられて、小さなベットにもぐり込んだボクが、ふと鎌首を持ち上げてみると――。
　一枚しかないパジャマをボクにとられて、晒しの襦袢一枚ホーゼに腰巻という寒そうな姿の彼女が、部屋の隅の小さな机の前に、きちんとかしこまって、何かしきりに拝んでいるではないか。
「何を拝んでやがるのだろう？」
　首を伸したボクの眼に映じたのは、一葉の寫眞だつた。四十五六とも見える、不幸さうな顔をした女の寫眞――「きつと、あいつの母親だな」と思つた瞬間、ボクは鉛のような物を胸に感じた。
　とたんに、彼女はダリヤのような明るい微笑で一杯になった美しい顔をボクの方へ向けて、幸福そうな、弾んだ声で、
「あたし、あなたと今夜結婚すること、母さんに話したのよ。……母さん、とっても喜んでくれたわ。お前は幸福な女だつて、嬉しいッ！」
　甘えるような聲とともにボクの胸に飛びついて来られた時には、さすがのボクも参つた。
　あやしむ彼女を、静かに制して、ベツトから出て、モソ〜と一たん脱いだ洋服を着込んでから、さて、自分は決して独身者川本にあらずして、妻帯者の渡邊であることを語り、平あやまりにあやまった時のあの、彼女の絶望にうちひしがれた、呆然たるその瞬間の表情は未だに忘れられない。
　泣き崩れる彼女を後に放々の態で、アパートから飛び出した瞬間、ボクは自分の古ぼけたレインコートを彼女の部屋へ置き忘れてきたことを思い出した。しかし、引き返す勇気はなかつた。
　彼女、あのレインコートをどうしたかしら、とボクは未だにそれを思つている。

ナミダを輕蔑する人は、人にし人にあらずであります。血もナミダもない野郎なのでございます。
泪に生れて、泪に死ぬのが人生でございます。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"It's okay, I'll pay for you [tab] for now..."
The ledger worked. For such a reason, I, in this bar, for a while, was in a truly blessed situation.
I, moved by that comfort, the proceeding with the vital talk with her, even that I had almost forgotten, and to tell the truth, I tried to forget as much as possible.
That is because, for me, stretching out the comfort in this bar even a moment longer was nothing other than what I wanted.
However, she who was entrusted with the ledger every night, herself was in a different position from me.
"I, tonight, have a little talk for you."
"I have a talk, you know."
Finally, "the hand has turned" (caught me), I felt.
"What talk is it?"
"It's not the kind of talk we can do in a place like this—wait for me on the way back, okay."
Finally, I was "nailed" (warned/pinned), but that night,
"A hotel is a waste, instead come to my apartment. I want you to see my life once."
When that came, I was not a little surprised. And being taken to a modest apartment room in the suburbs, drinking a cup of coffee boiled on a gas stove modestly each, then made to wear woman's pajamas smelling of face powder, fitting tightly (tsuntsuruten), I, who crawled into a small bed, suddenly raising my head like a sickle (kamakubi) and looking—
Having her only pair of pajamas taken by me, wearing only a bleached undershirt, hose, and a waistcloth, appearing cold, she, in front of a small desk in the corner of the room, sat formally, and was she not intently praying to something?
"What is she praying to, I wonder?"
Stretching my neck, what reflected in my eyes was a single photograph. A photo of a woman looking about forty-five or six, with an unhappy face—the moment I thought, "Surely, it's that girl's mother," I felt a leaden thing in my chest.
Suddenly, she, turning a beautiful face full of a dahlia-like bright smile toward me, with a happy, bouncing voice,
"I told Mother about marrying you tonight. ...Mother was very happy. She said I am a happy woman, I'm so glad!"
When she jumped into my chest with a coaxing voice, even I was defeated.
Quietly restraining the suspicious her, getting out of bed, and after putting on the clothes I had once taken off slowly (mozo-mozo), well, I told her I am absolutely not the single man Kawamoto, but the married man Watanabe, and the time I apologized flatly, that expression of hers, crushed by despair, dazed, that moment's expression I still cannot forget.
Leaving the breaking-down-crying her behind in a state of flight (houhou-no-tai), the moment I jumped out of the apartment, I remembered I had left my old raincoat in her room. However, I didn't have the courage to go back.
Her, what did she do with that raincoat, I wonder—even now I think of that.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Don't worry about it; I'll put it on the tab for you..."
The ledger was patient. Thanks to her generosity, I enjoyed a truly charmed existence at that bar for a time. I was so caught up in the comfort of it all that I nearly forgot the serious conversation we needed to have—or rather, if I'm being honest, I went out of my way to avoid it. I simply wanted to stretch out those easy, comfortable nights at the bar for as long as I possibly could.
But she, who managed that ledger every night, saw things differently.
"I have something I need to tell you tonight," she said. "We need to talk."
I felt a sudden chill, as if the hands of fate had finally caught up with me.
"What is it?" I asked.
"It's not something I can talk about here. Wait for me after work."
The trap was set. That night, she told me, "A hotel is such a waste of money. Come back to my apartment instead. I want you to see how I live, just once."
I was more than a little surprised. She led me to a modest little room in the suburbs. We shared a simple cup of coffee brewed on a gas ring, and then she lent me a pair of her pajamas. They smelled faintly of her face powder and were comically small on me, but I crawled into her narrow bed anyway. When I glanced up, I saw a sight that gave me pause.
Because I was wearing her only pair of pajamas, she was left in nothing but a thin cotton undershirt, stockings, and a waistcloth. She looked freezing. She was kneeling formally at a tiny desk in the corner of the room, praying fervently to something.
"What on earth is she praying to?" I wondered.
I craned my neck to see. It was a photograph—a picture of a woman in her mid-forties with a deeply unhappy face. "That must be her mother," I thought, and a weight like lead settled in my chest.
At that moment, she turned toward me, her face radiant with a smile like a blooming dahlia. In a voice bright with joy, she said, "I told Mother we're getting married tonight. She was so happy for me. She said I'm a lucky woman. Oh, I'm so happy!"
She threw herself into my arms, her voice full of sweet affection. Even a man like me felt a pang of guilt.
I gently pulled away from her confused embrace, got out of bed, and slowly pulled my clothes back on. Then, I told her the truth: I wasn't Kawamoto, the carefree bachelor she thought I was. I was Watanabe, and I was already married. I apologized over and over, but I will never forget the look on her face—the way her joy turned to total, hollow despair.
I fled the apartment, leaving her there crumpled and weeping. The moment I hit the street, I realized I’d left my old raincoat behind. But I didn't have the heart to go back for it.
I still wonder sometimes what she did with that old coat.
(The End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography**: The page is divided into two distinct sections: a narrative fiction piece on top and a thematic sidebar on the bottom right. The text is set in traditional vertical orientation (*tategaki*).
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The illustration dominates the upper-left quadrant, drawing the eye immediately to the romantic/melodramatic scene. The large-font title of the sidebar "人生、泪の生涯" creates a second focal point.
*   **Illustration Style**: The drawing features high-contrast linework and shading typical of mid-century Japanese magazine illustrations (*sashi-e*). The characters' features are somewhat Westernized, reflecting the "High Collar" (*haikara*) aesthetic of post-war urban romance.
*   **Formatting Elements**:
    *   The use of the repetition mark (〜) for "いよいよ" and "とうとう" is a common shorthand in mid-century printing.
    *   The sidebar uses triangular bullets (△) to categorize life stages, a common editorial device in "service" pages of general-interest magazines.
    *   The story concludes with a formal "(終)" (End) mark.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1950s)**: The mentions of a "sakaba" (bar), "apartment" (apaato), and "gas konro" (gas stove) place this in the mid-Showa era. In the 1950s, urban "apartments" were often wooden structures with shared facilities, representing a modern but often precarious lifestyle for young workers and bar hostesses.
*   **Bar Culture and "O-chomen"**: In the post-war era, many bars operated on a credit system for regulars (*tsuke*), recorded in a ledger (*o-chomen*). The protagonist is essentially a "moocher" taking advantage of the woman's affection to avoid paying his bill.
*   **Social Morality**: The story touches on the common trope of the "deceived woman" and the "unfaithful urban man." The revelation that he is a married man (*saitaisha*) using a pseudonym (Kawamoto vs. Watanabe) highlights the anonymity and moral flexibility of the growing metropolis.
*   **The "Mother" Figure**: The photograph of the unhappy mother represents the traditional weight of family expectations. The woman's desire to report her "marriage" to her mother's spirit/photo underscores her longing for legitimacy and a traditional escape from her current life.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **お帳面がきく (O-chomen ga kiku)**: Lit. "The ledger works." It means the establishment allows one to buy on credit/tab.
*   **肝心かなめ (Kanjin kaname)**: The most important point; the crux of the matter.
*   **手がまわった (Te ga mawatta)**: Usually means "the police have closed in" or "resources have been exhausted," but here it is used figuratively to mean "the game is up" or "she's cornered me into a commitment."
*   **釘をさされた (Kugi wo saserareta)**: To be given a firm warning or to have something nailed down/confirmed so one cannot back out.
*   **つんつるてん (Tsun-tsuru-ten)**: An onomatopoeic expression meaning clothes that are much too short or tight for the wearer.
*   **晒しの襦袢 (Sarashi no juban)**: A white cotton undergarment.
*   **ホーゼ (Ho-ze)**: From the German *Hose* or English *hose*, referring to stockings or long socks.
*   **放々の態 (Hou-hou no tai)**: Fleeing in a state of confusion or panic; "scurrying away."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Pure-Hearted Fallen Woman"**: A classic archetype in Japanese *Taishu Bungaku* (popular literature). Despite working in a bar and living a modest life, the woman is portrayed as pious and family-oriented, making the protagonist's betrayal more poignant.
*   **Urban Loneliness and Deception**: The protagonist enjoys the "comfort" of the bar, which is a commodified form of intimacy. When faced with real intimacy and commitment (the apartment, the mother's photo), he recoils and flees.
*   **The Inevitability of Sorrow (Sidebar)**: The sidebar "Life, a Lifetime of Tears" provides a cynical yet sentimental counterpoint. It suggests that from birth to death, human life is defined by crying—shifting from innocent reasons (sweets) to social pressures (exams, jobs) to domestic misery (wives, delinquent sons).
*   **Melodrama and Guilt**: The ending, where he wonders about the raincoat, is a "soft" ending typical of the era, where the protagonist expresses a lingering, useless sentimentality over a life he chose to destroy.
