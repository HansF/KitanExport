**風呂屋繁昌記**
神山栄三

最近地では風呂屋の数はうんと減つている。燃料代が又べら棒な値上りのところから四国の湯賃では経営が困難だと世は正に戦時時代である。神戸市の某所に最近新しく建築された、さくら湯がある、此の風呂は実に気持がよい、新しくて、湯がきれいである。だがそれだけで、客足が多いのだろうか、
「おい君、さくら湯はいいよ。」
「ほんとうかい？」
「うん、清潔、気持がいいよ。」
あまりに友達が賞めそやすので、私も手拭を肩に出かけた。
衣裳入箱といい、戸棚といい何んとなく新しいので気持がよい、湯槽は昔のまゝの木造と云うのでこの木の香を鼻にするだけでも、ホンノリと酔てしまう。
々と湯をたたえた中にしたたつていると、浪花節でも一つうなりたいとゆう気になつてくる。身体中の汗をすつかり流して、庭に面したベランダに座ると、どうも女湯との間ののれんが短い。
見るとはなしに頭を下げてみると見える、おゝ歓喜をめぐる五人の女そつくりの美しい裸像の立膝が、腰から下だけが、はつきり見える。女の方ではわかるまい、しかも顔が見えなくて、腰部の曲線美だけが望ましくも豊満な動きを見せているのだから、うならざるを得ない。
此ののれんの見える場所は只一つある斜線をひいた角度に座らないと全然見えない。まるで覗きのようであつて、ここからは局部を十分に楽しむことが出来る。
腰から下のみの美しさ程、男の官能をたぶらかすものはない。
でも長く同じ姿勢をとつている事が出来ないので、チラリと見ては知らぬ顔をする。此の瞬間の耽美感を心の中にそつとしまい込んでゆくのである。
男と言うものは一度このスリルに酔うと、どうしても、もう忘れることが出来なくなる。種々と変つた姿態が次々と見たくなつて来るのが人情である。
立膝を組んだところ、股を思いきり開いたところ、見ていろさえ、官能の乱舞の前に自らが狂いそうになるのである。此のスリルの楽しみがさくら湯に結びつけてしまつた。
私はこの角度を保持してから、この位置を変えたことがない。ところが名入りののれんが、広告宣伝のために時々取り換えられる。
これが曲者なのである。その変つたのれん毎に角度が違つてくる。二週間で一廻りするらしい宣伝ののれん毎にその角度をのみこんでしまつたのである。
どののれんを吊られれば、どの角度に、どののれんは、どの角度にと物覚えのわるい私も、こればかりはちゃんと覚えられた。
何んと勝手なものだろう、好奇心がつまらぬ所に集中している頃、宣傳用の鏡の寄附が、所狭いまでに送られて、部屋中にかけられた。
此の鏡が丁度、潜水艦の展望鏡のような働きをしているのに気がついた。一つの鏡を眞正面から見ると自分だけがうつり、何等普通の鏡と変わりないけれども、或る角度からこれを眺めると女湯の方がまる目に見える。
おゝ此れこそ長崎物語以上であり裸體ダンス以上なのである。七百圓も千圓もの會費を出して見に行く人もあると言うのに、たつた六圓ばかりの湯賃さえ拂えば、後は一切無料で楽しめるというのだから凄い。
光線の工合によつて映る人達の裸像が美しくも見え、醜くも見えたりした。立つた姿、坐つた姿、腰かけた姿、乳房をよくます姿、あゝ何んという千差萬別の傅觀であろうか何のつつしみかくしもなく全裸であるが故に、自然的に制禦出来なくなつて来る場合がある。しかも鏡を通してのエロは何となくホノボノとした楽しい夢を展開さすものである。
一度此の秘密を發見した者は誰でも心の中に秘めて自分一人だけでそつとのしみたいと思うものであつて、他人に此の秘密を盗まれるということは、堪えられぬ愁しさを抱くものである。
此の鏡ものれんの様に位置が變えられるらしい、昨日楽しめたからその角度で鏡に向うと、とんだ目に合う、そこで日々の鏡へ拂われる苦心の程が伺われる。
主人は此の事を知らぬように粧つているが、一つの寄寄せのトリックとして移動さしているに違いない
エロで釣る鏡のトリック、此れこそお稲荷さんを祀る以上の効果をあげるものである。何時とはなしにさくら湯の人気の氣は街中に彌漫していった。
「おい、さくら湯は満點のサービスだぞ。」
「ねえ、さくら湯へ行つてごらん、ホルモン剤がいらないわよ。」
不妊症がさくら湯へ行けばなおると言う。女湯の方でも男湯と同じ感覚が得られるに違いない。

**風呂屋繁昌記**
神山栄三

最近、当地では風呂屋の数はうんと減っている。燃料代がまたべらぼうな値上がりのところから、四銭の湯賃では経営が困難だと、世は正に戦時時代（のような状況）である。神戸市の某所に最近新しく建築された「さくら湯」がある。この風呂は実に気持ちがよい。新しくて湯がきれいである。だが、それだけで客足が多いのだろうか。
「おい君、さくら湯はいいよ」
「本当かい？」
「うん、清潔で気持ちがいいよ」
あまりに友達が褒めそやすので、私も手ぬぐいを肩に出かけた。
衣装箱といい、戸棚といい、何となく新しいので気持ちがよい。湯船は昔のままの木造だというので、この木の香を鼻にするだけでも、ほんのりと酔ってしまう。
なみなみと湯をたたえた中に浸かっていると、浪花節でも一つ唸りたいという気になってくる。体中の汗をすっかり流して、庭に面したベランダに座ると、どうも女湯との間の暖簾（のれん）が短い。
見るとはなしに頭を下げてみると見える。おお、歓喜をめぐる五人の女そっくりの美しい裸像の立て膝が、腰から下だけがはっきり見える。女の方ではわかるまい。しかも顔が見えなくて、腰部の曲線美だけが望ましくも豊満な動きを見せているのだから、唸らざるを得ない。
この暖簾の見える場所はただ一つ、ある斜線を引いた角度に座らないと全然見えない。まるで覗きのようであって、ここからは局部を十分に楽しむことができる。
腰から下のみの美しさほど、男の官能をたぶらかすものはない。
でも長く同じ姿勢をとっていることができないので、チラリと見ては知らぬ顔をする。この瞬間の耽美感を心の中にそっとしまい込んでいくのである。
男というものは、一度このスリルに酔うと、どうしても、もう忘れることができなくなる。色々と変わった姿態が次々と見たくなってくるのが人情である。
立て膝を組んだところ、股を思い切り開いたところ、見ているだけで、官能の乱舞の前に自らが狂いそうになるのである。このスリルの楽しみが、私をさくら湯に結びつけてしまった。
私はこの角度を保持してから、この位置を変えたことがない。ところが、名入りの暖簾が広告宣伝のために時々取り替えられる。
これが曲者なのである。その変わった暖簾ごとに角度が違ってくる。二週間で一回りするらしい宣伝の暖簾ごとに、その角度を飲み込んでしまったのである。
どの暖簾が吊るされればどの角度に、あの暖簾はあの角度にと、物覚えの悪い私もこればかりはちゃんと覚えられた。
なんと勝手なものだろう。好奇心がつまらぬ所に集中している頃、宣伝用の鏡の寄付が所狭しまでに送られて、部屋中にかけられた。
この鏡がちょうど、潜水艦の展望鏡（ペリスコープ）のような働きをしているのに気がついた。一つの鏡を真っ正面から見ると自分だけが映り、何ら普通の鏡と変わりないけれども、ある角度からこれを眺めると女湯の方が丸見えに見える。
おお、これこそ「長崎物語」以上であり、裸体ダンス以上なのである。七百円も千円もの会費を出して見に行く人もあるというのに、たった六円ばかりの湯賃さえ払えば、あとは一切無料で楽しめるというのだから凄い。
光線の具合によって、映る人たちの裸像が美しくも見え、醜くも見えたりした。立った姿、座った姿、腰掛けた姿、乳房をよく（洗う）姿、ああ何という千差万別の壮観であろうか。何の慎み隠しもなく全裸であるがゆえに、自然的に制御できなくなってくる場合がある。しかも鏡を通してのエロは何となくほのぼのとした楽しい夢を展開させるものである。
一度この秘密を発見した者は、誰でも心の中に秘めて、自分一人だけでそっと楽しみたいと思うものであって、他人にこの秘密を盗まれるということは、耐えられぬ悲しさを抱くものである。
この鏡も暖簾のように位置が変えられるらしい。昨日楽しめたからとその角度で鏡に向かうと、とんだ目に遭う。そこで日々の鏡へ払われる苦心のほどが伺われる。
主人はこのことを知らぬように装っているが、一つの客寄せのトリックとして移動させているに違いない。
エロで釣る鏡のトリック、これこそお稲荷さんを祀る以上の効果を挙げるものである。いつとはなしにさくら湯の人気の気は街中に弥漫していった。
「おい、さくら湯は満点のサービスだぞ」
「ねえ、さくら湯へ行ってごらん。ホルモン剤がいらないわよ」
不妊症がさくら湯へ行けば治るという。女湯の方でも男湯と同じ感覚が得られるに違いない。

**Bathhouse Prosperity Record**
By Kamiyama Eizō

Recently in this area, the number of bathhouses is greatly decreasing. Because fuel costs have also risen extravagantly, with a bath fee of four sen [unclear if 4 sen or 6 yen later], management is difficult, and the world is truly like a wartime era. In a certain place in Kobe City, there is the recently newly built "Sakura-yu." This bath is truly pleasant. It is new, and the water is clean. But is that the only reason the customers' footsteps are many?
"Hey you, Sakura-yu is good."
"Is that true?"
"Yeah, clean, feels good."
Because my friends praised it so much, I also went out with a towel on my shoulder.
Whether the clothes boxes or the cupboards, everything is somehow new, so it feels good. Because the bathtub is made of wood as in the old days, just by putting the scent of this wood to my nose, I get slightly intoxicated.
While soaking in the water filled to the brim, I feel like I want to growl out a Naniwa-bushi song. After washing away all the sweat from my body, when I sit on the veranda facing the garden, somehow the curtain between [me and] the women's bath is short.
Without looking intentionally, when I lower my head and try to look, I can see. Oh, the standing knees of beautiful naked statues exactly like five women surrounding joy; only from the waist down can be clearly seen. On the women's side, they probably don't know. Moreover, since the faces cannot be seen and only the curved beauty of the waist shows desirable and voluptuous movements, I cannot help but groan.
The place where this curtain can be seen is only one; if you don't sit at a certain diagonal angle, it cannot be seen at all. It is just like peeping, and from here, one can sufficiently enjoy the private parts.
There is nothing that seduces a man's senses as much as the beauty of only from the waist down.
But because one cannot stay in the same posture for long, I take a quick glance and then put on an indifferent face. I quietly tuck this moment's aesthetic feeling into my heart.
A man, once he becomes intoxicated by this thrill, by all means, can no longer forget it. It is human nature to want to see various changed postures one after another.
A scene where knees are tucked, a scene where thighs are opened wide—just by looking, one almost goes crazy before the dance of the senses. This enjoyment of the thrill has tied me to Sakura-yu.
Since I maintained this angle, I have never changed this position. However, the named curtains are sometimes replaced for advertising and promotion.
This is the tricky part. For every changed curtain, the angle becomes different. For every promotional curtain that seems to rotate once every two weeks, I have mastered its angle.
Which curtain hung meant which angle, that curtain meant that angle—even I, with my poor memory, was able to remember this much perfectly.
How selfish/convenient it is. While my curiosity was concentrated on such a trivial place, donations of mirrors for advertising were sent until the place was crowded, and they were hung throughout the room.
I noticed that these mirrors were functioning exactly like a submarine's periscope. If you look at one mirror from the dead front, only yourself is reflected, and it is no different from a normal mirror, but if you look at it from a certain angle, the women's bath side can be seen completely.
Oh, this is more than "Nagasaki Story" and more than a nude dance. Even though there are people who pay 700 yen or 1000 yen in membership fees to go see such things, if you just pay a bath fee of only about 6 yen, after that, everything can be enjoyed for free, so it is amazing.
Depending on the condition of the light, the naked statues of the people reflected looked beautiful, and sometimes looked ugly. Standing figures, sitting figures, figures perched on stools, figures washing breasts—oh, what a various and manifold spectacular sight! Because they are completely naked without any modesty or hiding, there are cases where one becomes naturally unable to control oneself. Moreover, the "ero" [eroticism] through a mirror somehow develops a pleasant, glowing dream.
Anyone who has discovered this secret once wants to keep it in their heart and enjoy it quietly by themselves; to have this secret stolen by others is to feel an unbearable sadness.
It seems these mirrors' positions can also be changed like the curtains. If you face the mirror at that angle because you enjoyed it yesterday, you meet with a terrible experience. There, the extent of the painstaking efforts paid to the daily mirrors can be glimpsed.
The owner pretends not to know this, but he must be moving them as a trick to attract customers.
A mirror trick that fishes with "ero"—this is something that achieves an effect greater than enshrining O-Inari-san. Before anyone knew it, the air of Sakura-yu's popularity spread throughout the town.
"Hey, Sakura-yu is a perfect service."
"Hey, try going to Sakura-yu. You won't need hormone injections."
They say infertility will be cured if you go to Sakura-yu. On the women's side, they must surely get the same sensation as the men's side.

**The Bathhouse Chronicles: A Tale of Prosperity**
By Kamiyama Eizō

Lately, the number of public bathhouses in this area has dwindled significantly. Between the exorbitant rise in fuel costs and the meager four-sen entry fee, keeping a bathhouse afloat is a struggle—it feels as though we are back in the thick of the war years. However, in a certain corner of Kobe, a newly built establishment called "Sakura-yu" has opened its doors. It is a truly delightful place—pristine, modern, and the water is crystal clear. But is cleanliness really the only reason the crowds are flocking there?

"Hey, friend, you’ve got to try Sakura-yu," a buddy told me.
"Is it really that good?"
"Absolutely. It’s clean, and the atmosphere is fantastic."

Spurred by such high praise, I eventually slung a towel over my shoulder and went to see for myself. Everything from the locker boxes to the cupboards felt fresh and new. The tubs themselves are made of traditional wood, and the mere scent of the timber was enough to make me feel a pleasant sort of intoxication. 

As I soaked in the steaming water, filled to the very brim, I felt the urge to belt out a traditional folk song. After washing away the day's grime and sweat, I took a seat on the veranda overlooking the garden. It was then I noticed that the *noren* curtain separating the men’s side from the women’s was suspiciously short.

Without meaning to, I lowered my gaze, and there it was. Oh, the sight! The bent knees of five women, like beautiful naked statues in a circle of joy—specifically, everything from the waist down was in clear view. The women surely had no idea. Because their faces remained hidden, one could focus entirely on the voluptuous curves of their hips and their graceful movements. It was enough to make a man moan.

This view is only accessible from one specific spot; unless you sit at a very precise diagonal angle, you see nothing at all. It felt like a peep show, offering a full, unobstructed view of their private forms. There is nothing quite so seductive to a man's senses as the beauty of the female form from the waist down.

Knowing I couldn't hold the same position for too long without drawing suspicion, I would steal a glance and then quickly feign indifference, tucking that moment of aesthetic bliss away in my heart. Once a man gets a taste of this thrill, it becomes impossible to forget. It is human nature to crave a succession of different poses and forms.

Whether it was a woman with her knees tucked or her thighs spread wide, the sight alone was enough to drive one mad with sensory overload. It was this illicit thrill that bound me to Sakura-yu. I never changed my seat once I found that perfect angle. However, the bathhouse occasionally swaps the curtains for those bearing advertisements.

This is where things get tricky. Each new curtain requires a slightly different angle of observation. These promotional curtains seem to rotate every two weeks, and despite my poor memory, I have managed to memorize the exact seating position required for every single one of them.

How selfish our curiosities are! While I was obsessed with these trivialities, the bathhouse was flooded with "donated" advertising mirrors, which were hung all over the room. I soon realized these mirrors functioned like a submarine's periscope. Looking at them head-on, you see only your own reflection. But from a specific angle, the women's side of the bath is laid bare.

It was better than any show in Nagasaki or a cabaret nude dance. People pay hundreds or even thousands of yen in membership fees for such entertainment, yet here, for a mere six-yen bath fee, everything can be enjoyed for free. It’s incredible.

Depending on the play of light, the naked reflections could look either sublime or grotesque. Standing, sitting, washing their breasts—what a kaleidoscopic spectacle! Because they are entirely naked and uninhibited, the viewer can sometimes lose all self-control. This "eroticism through the looking glass" creates a sort of hazy, pleasant daydream.

Anyone who discovers this secret keeps it close to their chest, wanting to monopolize the view. To have someone else "steal" your spot or your secret is a source of unbearable jealousy. It seems the mirrors, like the curtains, are moved slightly from time to time. If you try to use yesterday’s angle, you’ll be disappointed. One can sense the owner's calculated effort behind these daily adjustments.

The owner puts on an air of innocence, but he is undoubtedly moving them as a ploy to lure customers. This "erotic mirror trick" is more effective for business than any shrine to the god of prosperity. Word of Sakura-yu’s "excellent service" eventually spread like wildfire through the town.

"Sakura-yu is a ten-out-of-ten service!" men would say.
"Go to Sakura-yu, you won't even need your hormone supplements," others joked.

They even say it cures infertility. I suspect the women on their side are getting the exact same thrill as the men.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a vertical, right-to-left orientation, standard for Japanese periodicals. It is divided into two main columns of text, though the flow is continuous.
*   **Typography:** The title "風呂屋繁昌記" is set in a large, bold, decorative font that stands out from the body text. The author's name "神山栄三" is smaller and positioned below the title.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the dominant element, followed by the author's name, then the body text. The page number "— 29 —" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is a single page from a larger magazine.
*   **Column Structure:** The text uses a standard "shinbun" (newspaper) style column layout, which maximizes the amount of text on a small page.
*   **Style:** The prose is conversational yet descriptive, typical of "zuihitsu" (essay) or "ero-guro" pulp fiction of the era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s - early 1950s):** The text mentions "wartime era" (戦時時代) as a point of comparison for high prices and hardship, suggesting it was written shortly after WWII. The mention of "6 yen" or "4 sen" (the transcription is slightly ambiguous between old and new currency units used during hyperinflation) reflects the economic volatility of the postwar period.
*   **Sento Culture:** Public bathhouses (sento) were essential social and hygienic hubs in postwar Japan when most homes lacked private baths. The layout with a low partition and *noren* (curtains) is a staple of traditional sento design.
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** This piece fits perfectly into the "Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense" literary movement, which flourished in the pre-war period and saw a resurgence in pulp magazines (called *kasutori* magazines) after the war. These magazines focused on scandal, sex, and the bizarre.
*   **Nagasaki Monogatari (Nagasaki Story):** Likely a reference to a popular song or film of the era, used as a benchmark for high-quality entertainment.
*   **Hormone Injections:** In the early-mid 20th century, "hormone therapy" was a popular (and often dubious) health fad in Japan, touted as a cure-all for vitality and sexual vigor.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **繁昌 (Hanjō):** Prosperity or "doing a roaring business."
*   **べら棒 (Berabō):** Extravagant, absurd, or ridiculous (often used for prices).
*   **耽美感 (Tanbi-kan):** Aestheticism or a sense of finding beauty in the decadent/sensual.
*   **曲者 (Kusemono):** A tricky person, a "shifty character," or in this context, "the catch" or "the tricky part."
*   **官能 (Kannō):** Senses, particularly sensual or carnal desires.
*   **弥漫 (Biman):** To permeate or spread widely (usually used for smells or atmospheres).
*   **お稲荷さん (O-Inari-san):** Inari, the deity of fertility, rice, and agriculture, often prayed to for business prosperity.
*   **物覚えのわるい (Mono-oboe no warui):** Having a poor memory.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism as Marketing:** The central theme is the "accidental-on-purpose" voyeurism facilitated by the bathhouse owner. It suggests a subtext where commercial success in the postwar era was often tied to providing "service" (erotic thrills) to a base of male customers.
*   **The Male Gaze:** The text is a quintessential example of the male gaze, objectifying the female body into "naked statues" and "curved beauty" without acknowledging them as individuals.
*   **Shared Secrets:** There is a psychological subtext about the "thrill of the secret." The author notes that part of the enjoyment is the exclusivity—knowing something others don't.
*   **Satire of "Health":** The ending, which claims the bathhouse cures infertility or replaces hormone medicine, is likely satirical, poking fun at the medical fads of the day while equating sexual arousal with health.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay, Pulp Fiction, Magazine Article.
*   **Genre:** Ero-Guro (Erotic-Grotesque), Social Satire.
