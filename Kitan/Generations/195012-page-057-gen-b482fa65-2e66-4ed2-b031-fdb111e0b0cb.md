ラブ・ロマンス
**思春期の乙女**
平井京助

**一、ラブ・シーン**

　それは、もうとつくに都会の封切館でみた映画なので、わたしは、退屈まぎれに、ときどき良子（よしこ）の横顔（よこがお）を盗視していた。
　おさげに結（むす）つた髪を胸に垂（た）らしているので、頬（ほお）の半分は隠れてみえないが不健康に蒼白い顔は、珍らしく、ぽつと汗ばんで光つていて、それに、スクリーンの反射が、ちらちら映つていた。
　換気設備のない閉めきつた小屋の中は、暑苦しくて堪らないのに、彼女はまるでお客にいつた時のように、膝（ひざ）も崩さずに、きちんと座（すわ）つていたのだ。たぶん、わたしに遠慮しているのだろう。
　その窮屈そうに張りきつた浴衣の膝をみていると、わたしは、ふと、先日のことを思い出した。
　それは、つい数日前のことだが、わたしは、いつものように絵具箱をもつて、終日野外へ写生に出かけていて、夕方、家へ帰つてくると、ちょうど、良子が、既（はだ）しになつて、裾（すそ）を高くかかげ、甲斐がいしく植込（うえこみ）に水を撒（ま）いていた。
　わたしは、彼女の家の二階に起居しているので、彼女の、こんな姿は始終見なれていた。それに、寝相（ねぞう）の悪い彼女は、よく大つぴらに、白い四肢（しし）を布団（ふとん）からはみ出させて、書（ひる）寝をしていた。十六にしては完全すぎるほど立派なおんなになりきつていたが、なんといっても、まだ無邪気なものだと、彼女の母親と一緒に凝（み）つめながら微笑んでいたし、凝められていたことを知つても、彼女は平気であつた。
　それなのに、跣（はだ）足で水を撒（ま）いていた彼女が、わたしの姿に気がつくと、どうしたのか急に、あッ！と叫んで、慌てて裾を押し下げようとあせりながら、両手で脛（すね）を掩（おお）い隠した。
　そして、今にも泣き出しそうな、真赤な顔をして、後（うしろ）じさりに台所へ逃げこんだのである。
　それが、あんまり出しぬけだつたので、かえつて、わたしの方が面喰（めんくら）つた。はいけないものを見たような恥かしさを感じた。
　その時いらい、わたしは、良子の白い脛の記憶に、夜毎（よごと）、悩まされるようになつてしまつた。
　映画は、馬鹿げたほど甘つたるい、他愛のない洋画だつたが、しかし、どの場合も、どの場合も、実にロマンチックで美しかつた。
　良子は、熱心にみつめていた。まるで、映画の中に、身も心も曳（ひ）き入れられてしまつているようだった。
　わたしは、そんな映画よりも、彼女の白い、汗ばんだ顔に、ちらちら動いている、色んな光線の変化の方が、はるかに美しく、楽しく感じられた。
　スクリーンは、相愛の男女が、始終現れ、しつこく、幾度となく接吻（せっぷん）を交した。大袈裟な愛撫（あいぶ）の場面がしきりに出てきた。
　ふと、わたしは、近くで大きな溜息（ためいき）を聞いてびつくりした。溜息の主（ぬし）は彼女であつた。
　それは、接吻のシーンに向つて発せられるものだということが分つた。わたしは、興味を唆（そそ）られて、彼女をつぐつぐ観察した。
　彼女は、映画と現実を混同させてしまつて、自分が主演者になつてでもいるかのように、唇をわななわなと顫（ふる）わせ、うれしいとも、苦しいともつかない、もの凄（すご）いほどの緊張を顔に漲（みなぎ）らせて、眼をつぶつてしまうのであつた。
　圧（おさ）え潰（つぶ）されたような溜息は、恥かしくて聞いていられないくらい、大げさで忘我的なものであつた。
　その夜映画館を出てからも、彼女はまるで酔拂（よっぱら）つた人のように、ふらふらしていた。

**二、くちづけ**

　その翌晩（よくばん）、わたしは妙な光景を発見した。二階で、勉強をしていたのだが、階下（かいか）から赤坊（あかんぼう）の、火のつくような泣き声が聞えてきたのである。

Love Romance
**The Maiden of Puberty**
By Hirai Kyōsuke

**1. Love Scene**

That was [a movie] already a long time ago at a city first-run theater seen movie since, I, as a distraction from boredom, sometimes Ryoko's profile was stealing glances at.
Because [she] had hair tied in braids hanging to her chest, half of her cheek was hidden and not visible, but her unhealthily pale face was, unusually, slightly sweating and shining, and in addition, the screen's reflections were flickering and being reflected [there].
Inside the closed-up shack with no ventilation equipment, although it was hot and unbearable, she, just like when going as a guest, without even breaking her posture at the knees, was sitting properly. Probably, she is being reserved toward me.
Looking at those cramped-looking, tightly stretched yukata knees, I, suddenly, remembered the matter of the other day.
That was, just a few days ago matter, but I, as usual having my paint box, all day outdoors for sketching had gone out, and in the evening, when returning to the house, exactly, Ryoko, becoming barefoot, lifting the hem [of her kimono] high, was gallantly in the bushes water scattering.
Since I in her house's second floor am living, her, this kind of appearance was always being used to seeing. Besides, she who has a bad sleeping posture, often openly, her white four limbs from the futon letting stick out, was napping. For sixteen, to a perfect degree a fine woman she had fully become, but, no matter what, still an innocent thing she was, [I] together with her mother while gazing was smiling, and even though knowing she was being gazed at, she was unconcerned.
Despite that, she who was barefoot scattering water, when she noticed my figure, for some reason suddenly, "Ah!" cried out, and while panicking trying to push the hem down, with both hands her shins she covered and hid.
And then, with a face about to cry, a bright red face, stepping backward into the kitchen she fled.
That, because it was so abrupt, on the contrary, I was the one who was taken aback. A "should not have seen something" kind of shame I felt.
Since that time, I, by the memory of Ryoko's white shins, every night, came to be tormented.
The movie was, to a foolish degree sugary, a trifling Western film, but, however, in every case, in every case, truly romantic and beautiful it was.
Ryoko was, intently gazing. It was as if, into the movie, body and soul were being drawn in.
I, rather than such a movie, on her white, sweated face, various light changes flickering and moving, by far more beautiful and enjoyable felt [them] to be.
On the screen, a mutually loving man and woman, constantly appeared, and persistently, many times kisses exchanged. Exaggerated caress scenes frequently came out.
Suddenly, I, nearby a large sigh heard and was surprised. The owner of the sigh was her.
That, toward the kissing scene it was being emitted, I understood. I, interest being piqued, observed her closely.
She, movie and reality having confused, as if she herself were becoming the lead performer, made her lips tremble, neither happy nor painful, a terrifying degree of tension in her face making overflow, she would close her eyes.
The suppressed-like sigh was, so shameful I couldn't bear to hear it, an exaggerated and self-forgetting thing it was.
That night after leaving the movie theater too, she just like a drunken person, was wobbling.

**2. The Kiss**

That next evening, I a strange scene discovered. On the second floor, I was studying, but from downstairs a baby's, like-fire-starting crying voice came to be heard.

**A Love Romance: The Maiden of Puberty**
By Hirai Kyōsuke

**I. The Love Scene**

Since I had already seen the film long ago at a first-run theater in the city, I found myself stealing glances at Ryoko’s profile to stave off boredom. Her hair was tied in braids that hung down over her chest, concealing half of her face. Yet her skin, usually an unhealthy pale, was unusually damp with a sheen of perspiration, catching the flickering reflections of the cinema screen.

Though the unventilated, shuttered theater was sweltering and nearly unbearable, she sat perfectly upright, her knees together as if she were a formal guest in someone's home. She was likely being demure out of consideration for my presence. Looking at the way her yukata stretched tightly and uncomfortably over her knees, I was suddenly reminded of an incident from a few days prior.

It happened just recently. I had spent the entire day outdoors sketching, as is my habit, paint box in hand. When I returned home that evening, I found Ryoko barefoot, her kimono hem hitched up high, busily watering the garden shrubbery. Since I lodge on the second floor of her family home, I was quite accustomed to seeing her like this. She was a restless sleeper and would often nap in the heat of the day with her white limbs sprawled shamelessly outside her futon. Though she had developed into a womanly figure—perhaps too much so for a girl of sixteen—I always thought of her as quite innocent. Her mother and I would often smile together as we watched her sleep, and even when she realized she was being observed, Ryoko never seemed to mind.

And yet, the moment she noticed me while she was watering the garden in her bare feet, she suddenly cried out, "Ah!" In a frantic panic, she tried to shove her hem down, shielding her shins with both hands. With a face turned scarlet, looking as though she might burst into tears at any moment, she backed away and fled into the kitchen.

Because it was so sudden, it was I who felt taken aback. I felt a pang of shame, as if I had glimpsed something I shouldn't have. Ever since that moment, the memory of Ryoko’s white shins has tormented me night after night.

The movie itself was a foolishly sentimental, trivial Western film, yet every scene was undeniably romantic and beautiful. Ryoko watched with rapt intensity. It was as if her very soul was being pulled into the screen. I found the play of light flickering across her pale, sweating face to be far more beautiful and captivating than the film itself.

On the screen, a pair of lovers appeared constantly, exchanging persistent and frequent kisses. Scenes of exaggerated physical affection played out one after another. Suddenly, I was startled by the sound of a heavy sigh nearby. It had come from her. I realized she had sighed in response to the kissing scene. Piqued by curiosity, I began to observe her intently.

She seemed to have blurred the line between the film and reality. As if she herself were the lead actress, her lips trembled rhythmically. Her face was flushed with a terrifying tension that was neither joy nor pain, and she squeezed her eyes shut. Her stifled sigh was so exaggerated and ecstatic that it felt almost shameful to overhear. Even after we left the theater that night, she remained lightheaded, swaying as if she were intoxicated.

**II. The Kiss**

The following evening, I stumbled upon a peculiar scene. I was upstairs in my room studying when, from the floor below, I heard the piercing, frantic cry of a baby.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The text is presented in traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tategaki*), reading from right to left. The title "ラブ・ロマンス" (Love Romance) and "思春期の乙女" (Maiden of Puberty) are set in a larger, bold font to establish visual hierarchy.
*   **Furigana:** The text makes moderate use of *furigana* (ruby characters) to provide readings for kanji that might be difficult or to specify a particular reading (e.g., 良子 as *Yoshiko*, 膝 as *hiza*).
*   **Columns:** The page is organized into narrow vertical columns, typical of mid-20th-century Japanese magazines.
*   **Illustration:** A hand-drawn illustration occupies the lower right quadrant, depicting a romantic scene between a man and a woman in Western-style clothing. This serves to visualize the "Western film" mentioned in the text and appeals to the reader's romantic sensibilities.
*   **Inset Box:** There is a small box titled "初恋獲得法" (How to Win First Love), which suggests this story was part of a larger feature or advice column geared toward young women or teenagers.
*   **Visual Texture:** The paper shows signs of aging (yellowing/foxing), and the printing quality is typical of high-volume pulp or "B-grade" magazines of the era (likely the late 1940s to early 1960s).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Era (Late 40s - 1950s):** The mention of "Western films" (*yōga*) and the excitement surrounding "kissing scenes" points to the early post-war era. During the Allied occupation and the decade following, Western (specifically American) culture, fashion, and romantic ideals flooded Japan.
*   **The "Kiss" Taboo:** Before the war, kissing in public or in Japanese films was extremely rare and often censored. The "kissing scene" became a symbol of modern, liberated, Western-style romance in the post-war period, often viewed with a mix of shock and fascination by the Japanese public.
*   **Lodging Culture:** The narrator lives on the "second floor" of the girl's house. This was a common arrangement for students or young workers (*geshuku*), where families would rent out spare rooms to supplement their income. This creates a domestic intimacy between the narrator and the daughter of the house.
*   **Yukata and Social Norms:** Ryoko wearing a *yukata* (casual summer kimono) and watering the garden is a classic "cool of the evening" (*yū-suzumi*) scene. Her sudden shame at showing her shins reflects the transition from childhood innocence to sexual self-awareness during puberty (*shishunki*).
*   **Movie Theaters:** The term "封切館" (*fukirikkan*) refers to first-run theaters in major cities that showed the newest releases, a major luxury and social outing in the post-war years.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **乙女 (Otome):** A "maiden" or young, pure woman. It carries a more poetic and innocent connotation than simply "girl."
*   **封切館 (Fukirikkan):** A first-run movie theater.
*   **盗視 (Tōshi):** To look stealthily; stealing a glance.
*   **甲斐がいしく (Kaigashiku):** Gallantly, briskly, or devotedly working.
*   **四肢 (Shishi):** Limbs (arms and legs).
*   **接吻 (Seppun):** An older, somewhat more formal or literary word for "kiss" (modern Japanese uses the loanword *kissu* more frequently).
*   **忘我的 (Bōgateki):** Ecstatic; in a state of self-forgetfulness or trance.
*   **火のつくような (Hi no tsuku yōna):** Literally "like a fire starting"; used to describe a very loud, sudden, and intense crying.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Awakening Sexuality:** The core theme is the "Maiden of Puberty" discovering her own sexuality. Her reaction to the movie—the physical trembling and the "terrifying tension"—indicates a biological and emotional response to romantic stimuli she doesn't yet fully understand.
*   **The Male Gaze:** The story is told from the perspective of a male narrator who "observes" and "steals glances" at Ryoko. He notices her transition from a "child" who slept shamelessly to a "woman" who is suddenly conscious of her exposed legs.
*   **Western Influence vs. Japanese Tradition:** The contrast between the "exaggerated" and "trifling" Western movie and the humid, cramped Japanese theater/home highlights the cultural tension of the era. The movie provides a script for romance that Ryoko attempts to internalize.
*   **Reality vs. Fantasy:** Ryoko "confuses the movie with reality," projecting herself into the role of the actress. This suggests a theme of escapism common in post-war youth culture.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Romance.
*   **Era:** Showa Period (c. 1950s).
*   **Themes:** Puberty, Romantic Awakening, Cinema, Westernization, Voyeurism, Coming-of-age.
*   **Tone:** Melodramatic, observational, slightly eroticized (typical of "romance" magazines of the time).
