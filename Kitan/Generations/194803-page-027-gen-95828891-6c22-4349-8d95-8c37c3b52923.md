探淫放浪記
棗を賣る女 —
並木宏次

此所へ來て五日目の夜だつた。
屋外には絹糸のような雨がけぶつていた。花崗岩で畳み上げた壁側へ釣らしたカンテラからは、油煙がグロテスクに、渦を巻きたてていた。
その油煙が、スウツと、垂直に棒立ちになつたので、オヤッと思つた私が、いきなりふりむくと、入口からスヨチ〜と入つてきた年若な女があつた。
私が暫らくふりかえつて、あツ氣にとられているのもかまわず、つかつかと、馴れた足取りで寄つてきた「大人、棗はいらないかね」
そういつた調子は優しい調子だつた。賑わしい内地をとび出して放浪のあてない旅を續けているコスモポリタンの私、旅の雨、一人懷かしさを感ずるのであつた。
「何に、棗？」
「えい」
「うん、貰つてもいいな」
私は竹籠の中を覗いてみた。
處女の乳房のような、紅くてぽつちりとふくれた棗が、底の方に、ほんのすこししかなかつた。
皆んな買つてやつたつて高はしれている。――私は値段も聞かずに、「みんな、こつちへ出せ」と言つた。
女は快く笑つた。竹籠を空いた椅子の上のへ下すと、今度はその椅子ごと私の側へ持つてきた。
そして何んと彼女はごろりと寝臺の上へ仰向けにころがつてしまつたではないか。
膝がつて、足をひろげて、私が夜毎に使う空氣枕を隅つこへよけて、いよ〜ニッと甘やかな微笑を投げかけた。
私は妙な氣になつた、でも「おい〜、何にするんだ、そこへころがつちやいけない、下りてくれ、泥靴のまゝはい上つてさ……」
「大人、何をそんなにおどなるの」
女は平氣だつた。なんと圖々しい女だろう。私は唇まではこんだ棗を竹籠の中へ投げ込んで立ち上つた。
「いらつしやい、こつちへ」
まるで自分の寝臺であるかのよう
に言うのであつた。私はてつきり此れは色情狂の女ぢやないかと思つたもんだから、大きな聲で叫んだ。
「亭主、來てくれッ」
宿の亭主や番頭たちが、私の聲を聞きつけてやつてきたが、さて、寝臺の上の女を見ると、一緒にプツと吹き出してしまつた。
「何んで、笑うのだ？」
長さ三尺もあろうと思われる竹煙管を咬わえた亭主は天井に向つて白い煙を吹き上げて言つた。
「貴方は、この女から棗をお買いなすつたでしょう？」
「うん、買つたよ」
「ヘッヽ、ぢや何んですかい、一向に御存じぢやなかつたんで、」
そうですかい、實はその、これを買つてやるつてのは、賣主の女を買つてやると約束したことになるのでして……」
「な、なるほど」
「この女がお氣に召さなかつたら、また他に澤山いい玉がいますよ」
「そうか、いい様にしてくれ」
ついに無聊は私に求めてならないものを求めさしてしまつた。
フラ〜と奥からざんばら髪の男が横をすり抜けて出てゆく。
私はもういたたまれずに、友人を誘つた。
「君、出ようか」
「いや、面白い、もう少し」
彼は赤い顔を上げて、手を振つたばかりで立とうとはしない。立ち上つた私は、仕方なく再び腰を下してウイスキーを二三杯口にした。
「さあ、今度こそ引き上げようぜ、うろつすると終電車に間に合わないよ、君」
私はどうしても今晩中に書き上げねばならない原稿があつた。友人のどろんとした瞳には、生氣がなく物顫い猶の眼である。
「麓さん、御心配なくつてよ、余り晩くなつたら私のとこへお泊めするから……ね。」
女形、蝶八のそう言う眼は淫らかな焔が燃えていた。
ぷつと外に出ると、ほてつた顔に夜気が冷々とあたってくる。美貌で若かつたその友人は、それから暫くして、余り自慢にならない病氣に罹つて悄気ていた。
エトルリアの壷ならぬ、サバトの夜開く壷の怪奇な誘惑にかかつたのであつた。
判じ繪の様なグロテスクな人間の愛慾、螺八のようなソドミイの使徒が、舞台で踊つて、そしてその裏面では、奇怪な霊を愛玩する凄い仄かな、或は執拗で熱情的な人間の愛慾が、渦巻いているのである。

探淫放浪記
—棗（なつめ）を売る女—
並木宏次

ここへ来て五日目の夜だった。
屋外には絹糸のような雨が煙っていた。花崗岩で積み上げた壁側へ吊るしたカンテラからは、油煙がグロテスクに、渦を巻きたてていた。
その油煙が、スウッと、垂直に棒立ちになったので、おやっと思った私が、いきなり振り向くと、入口からひょいと入ってきた年若い女があった。
私がしばらく振り返って、呆気に取られているのも構わず、つかつかと、慣れた足取りで寄ってきた。「旦那、棗はいらないかね」
そう言った調子は優しい調子だった。賑やかな内地を飛び出して放浪の当てない旅を続けているコスモポリタンの私、旅の雨に、一人懐かしさを感ずるのであった。
「何に、棗？」
「はい」
「うん、もらってもいいな」
私は竹籠の中を覗いてみた。
処女の乳房のような、赤くてぽっちりと膨れた棗が、底の方に、ほんの少ししかなかった。
みんな買ってやったところで高が知れている。——私は値段も聞かずに、「みんな、こっちへ出せ」と言った。
女は快く笑った。竹籠を空いた椅子の上へ下ろすと、今度はその椅子ごと私の側へ持ってきた。
そしてなんと彼女は、ごろりとベッド（寝台）の上へ仰向けに転がってしまったではないか。
膝をついて、足を広げて、私が毎夜使う空気枕を隅っこへよけて、いよいよニッと甘やかな微笑を投げかけた。
私は妙な気になった。でも「おい、何にするんだ、そこへ転がっちゃいけない、下りてくれ、泥靴のまま這い上がってさ……」
「旦那、何をそんなに怒鳴るの」
女は平気だった。なんと図々しい女だろう。私は唇まで運んだ棗を竹籠の中へ投げ込んで立ち上がった。
「いらっしゃい、こっちへ」
まるで自分のベッドであるかのように言うのであった。私はてっきりこれは色情狂の女じゃないかと思ったもんだから、大きな声で叫んだ。
「主人、来てくれ！」
宿の主人や番頭たちが、私の声を聞きつけてやってきたが、さて、ベッドの上の女を見ると、一緒にぷっと吹き出してしまった。
「なんで、笑うのだ？」
長さ三尺（約90cm）もあろうと思われる竹煙管を咥えた主人は、天井に向かって白い煙を吹き上げて言った。
「あなたは、この女から棗をお買いになったでしょう？」
「うん、買ったよ」
「へっ、じゃあ何ですかい、一向にご存知じゃなかったんで。そうですかい、実はその、これを買ってやるっていうのは、売り主の女を買ってやると約束したことになるのでして……」
「な、なるほど」
「この女がお気に召さなかったら、また他にたくさんいい玉（いい女）がいますよ」
「そうか、いい様にしてくれ」
ついに無聊は私に求めてならないものを求めさせてしまった。

ふらりと奥からざんばら髪の男が横をすり抜けて出てゆく。
私はもう居たたまれずに、友人を誘った。
「君、出ようか」
「いや、面白い、もう少し」
彼は赤い顔を上げて、手を振ったばかりで立とうとはしない。立ち上がった私は、仕方なく再び腰を下ろしてウイスキーを二、三杯口にした。
「さあ、今度こそ引き上げようぜ、うろついていると終電車に間に合わないよ、君」
私はどうしても今晩中に書き上げねばならない原稿があった。友人のどろんとした瞳には、生気がなく物怖じしたような眼である。
「麓さん、ご心配なくってよ。あまり遅くなったら私のところへお泊めするから……ね」
女形、蝶八のそう言う眼には淫らな炎が燃えていた。
ぷっと外に出ると、ほてった顔に夜気が冷々と当たってくる。美貌で若かったその友人は、それからしばらくして、あまり自慢にならない病気に罹ってしょげていた。
エトルリアの壺ならぬ、サバトの夜開く壺の怪奇な誘惑にかかったのであった。
判じ絵のようなグロテスクな人間の愛欲、蝶八のようなソドミー（男色）の使徒が、舞台で踊って、そしてその裏面では、奇怪な霊を愛玩する凄まじい仄かな、あるいは執拗で情熱的な人間の愛欲が、渦巻いているのである。

**Chronicle of Seeking Lust and Wandering**
**—The Woman Who Sells Jujubes—**
**Namiki Hirotsugu**

It was the night of the fifth day since coming to this place.
Outside, rain like silk threads was misty. From the lantern hung on the granite-stacked wall side, oil smoke was grotesquely, swirlingly rising.
That oil smoke, *suu*, vertically stood like a pole, so "Oh?" thought I, and as I suddenly turned around, from the entrance, *suoyochi* [sound of entering], there was a young woman who had come in.
I for a while turned back, and even though I was taken aback, without minding, *tsukatsuka* [with brisk steps], with accustomed footsteps she approached, "Master, won't you have some jujubes?"
The tone of saying so was a gentle tone. Having leapt out of the busy Home Islands [Mainland Japan] and continuing a wandering aimless journey, the cosmopolitan me, in the journey's rain, felt a solitary nostalgia.
"What, jujubes?"
"Yes."
"Yeah, I might as well have some."
I tried peeking into the bamboo basket.
Like a virgin's breast, red and plumply swollen jujubes, at the bottom, there were only a very few.
Even if I bought them all, the amount would be negligible. —I, without even asking the price, said, "All of them, give them here."
The woman smiled pleasantly. Setting the bamboo basket down on top of an empty chair, this time with that chair she brought it to my side.
And then, what, she—*gorori*—on top of the bed, fell over onto her back, did she not!
Kneeling, spreading her legs, pushing aside the air pillow I use every night into a corner, *iyoiyo* [finally/increasingly]—*ni*—she threw a sweet smile.
I felt a strange mood. But, "Hey, what are you doing, you must not roll around there, please get down, with mud boots on climbing up..."
"Master, why do you shout so much?"
The woman was unconcerned. What a bold woman she is. I, the jujube I had carried to my lips, threw it into the bamboo basket and stood up.
"Welcome, this way,"
she said as if it were her own bed. I surely thought this must be a nymphomaniac woman, so with a loud voice I shouted.
"Landlord, come here!"
The inn's landlord and clerks, hearing my voice, came running, but well, seeing the woman on the bed, together—*pu*—they burst out laughing.
"Why do you laugh?"
The landlord, biting a bamboo pipe that seemed to be three *shaku* [approx 90cm] long, blowing white smoke toward the ceiling, said:
"You, you bought jujubes from this woman, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I bought them."
"Heh, well then what is it, you didn't know at all, then. Is that so, actually, that, to buy these [jujubes], means you have promised to buy the seller woman herself..."
"I... I see."
"If this woman is not to your liking, there are many other 'good gems' [good women]."
"I see, do as you like."
Finally, boredom made me seek what I must not seek.

*Fura*—from the back, a man with disheveled hair slipped past and went out.
I, no longer able to stay, invited my friend.
"Friend, shall we leave?"
"No, it's interesting, a little more."
He, raising a red face, only waved his hand and did not try to stand. I, having stood up, having no choice, again lowered my hips and put two or three glasses of whiskey to my mouth.
"Come, this time let's withdraw, if we dawdle we won't make the last train, friend."
I had a manuscript that I absolutely had to finish writing tonight. In the friend's blurred pupils, there was no vitality, eyes like a trembling beast.
"Mr. Fumoto, don't worry. If it gets too late, I'll let you stay at my place... okay?"
The *onnagata* [male actor of female roles], Chōhachi, in those saying eyes, a lewd flame was burning.
*Pu*—stepping outside, on my flushed face, the night air coldly hits. That friend, who was beautiful and young, after that for a while, contracted a disease not much to be proud of and was dejected.
It was not an Etruscan vase, but a strange temptation of a vase that opens on a Sabbath night that he fell into.
Human lust like a *panji-e* [rebus/puzzle picture], a disciple of sodomy like Chōhachi dancing on stage, and on the reverse side, a terrifyingly faint or persistent and passionate human lust cherishing a strange spirit is swirling.

**A Journal of Dissolute Wandering**
**—The Jujube Seller—**
**By Hirotsugu Namiki**

It was my fifth night in this town.
Outside, the rain fell in a fine, silken mist. Indoors, oil smoke swirled in grotesque patterns from a lantern hung against a wall of stacked granite. As the smoke suddenly drifted upward in a straight, stiff line, I turned in surprise to find a young woman slipping into the room.

Ignoring my stunned silence, she marched toward me with the practiced steps of someone who knew her way around. "Mister, care for some jujubes?" she asked. Her voice was unexpectedly tender. To a "cosmopolitan" like me—someone who had fled the bustling home islands to live a life of aimless wandering—the sound of her voice against the rhythm of the falling rain stirred a lonely sense of nostalgia.

"What? Jujubes?"
"Yes."
"Sure, I'll take some."

I peered into her bamboo basket. There were only a few left at the bottom, plump and red as a virgin’s nipple. The cost for the lot would be negligible. Without even asking the price, I said, "Give me all of them."

The woman gave a pleasant laugh. She set the basket on an empty chair and dragged it over to me. Then, to my utter disbelief, she flopped onto her back right on my bed! She knelt, spread her legs, shoved the air pillow I used every night into the corner, and flashed me a saccharine, knowing grin.

I felt a surge of unease. "Hey! What do you think you’re doing? You can’t lie there! Get down! You've climbed up with your muddy boots still on..."
"Mister, why are you shouting so?" she replied, completely unperturbed.
What a brazen woman. I threw the jujube I was about to eat back into the basket and stood up. 
"Come on, over here," she said, as if the bed were her own.

Convinced she was a nymphomaniac, I shouted for help. "Landlord! Come here!"
The landlord and his staff came running, but when they saw the woman on my bed, they burst into laughter.
"What’s so funny?" I demanded.
The landlord, clamped onto a three-foot bamboo pipe, exhaled a cloud of white smoke toward the ceiling. "You bought jujubes from this woman, didn't you?"
"Yes, I did."
"Heh... then you didn't know? Well, you see, around here, buying a woman's jujubes is a tacit agreement to 'buy' the seller herself."
"I... I see."
"If she isn't to your liking, we have plenty of other 'fine gems' available."
"Fine... do as you will."
Driven by sheer boredom, I had finally sought out the very thing I should have avoided.

A man with wild, disheveled hair slunk out from the back of the house. Unable to bear the atmosphere any longer, I nudged my friend. "Hey, let's get out of here."
"No way, this is interesting. A bit longer," he replied. His face was flushed. He waved me off, refusing to budge. I sighed and sat back down, knocking back two or three more whiskies.
"Look, we really have to go. If we linger any longer, we'll miss the last train."
I had a manuscript to finish by dawn, but my friend’s eyes were glazed over, devoid of life, like those of a cornered animal.

"Mr. Fumoto, don't you worry," purred Chōhachi, a male actor of female roles (*onnagata*). "If it gets too late, you can stay at my place... won't you?"
In Chōhachi’s eyes burned a lewd, flickering flame.

When we finally stepped outside, the cold night air bit into our flushed faces. My young, handsome friend would later contract a rather shameful disease, leaving him quite dejected. He had fallen not for the beauty of an Etruscan vase, but for the dark, monstrous temptation of a vessel that opens only on a Witches' Sabbath. 

The grotesque lusts of humanity—like a puzzle-picture come to life—and the "apostles of sodomy" like Chōhachi dance upon the stage. Yet behind that curtain swirls a terrifyingly faint, or perhaps stubbornly passionate, human desire that dotes upon the most bizarre of spirits.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese literary magazine format (vertical columns). It is divided into three main columns of text.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Ming-style (Minchō) typeface typical of the mid-20th century. The title is significantly larger and bolder, using a heavy weight for emphasis. The author's name is centered between the title and the start of the text.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses traditional Japanese punctuation (Japanese commas "、" and periods "。"). Notably, it uses elongated tildes (〜) to represent drawn-out sounds or sighs ("スヨチ〜", "いよ〜"). Quotation marks are standard Japanese corner brackets (「 」).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title *Taneiei Hourouki* (Chronicle of Seeking Lust and Wandering) is the dominant visual element, followed by the subtitle and then the narrative text. The page number "— 27 —" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is an excerpt from a larger serial or collection.
*   **Texture:** the paper appears to be "rough" pulp paper (typical for post-war *kasutori* magazines), with some ink bleed and aging visible in the scan.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-war 1940s-50s):** The vocabulary (whiskey, "cosmopolitan," "last train," "manuscript") and the setting (a shady inn, social wandering) suggest the *Buraiha* (Decadent School) literary movement of the immediate post-war era. Writers like Dazai Osamu or Sakaguchi Ango often explored these themes of disillusionment and sordid encounters.
*   **"Hourouki" (Wandering Records):** The title echoes Hayashi Fumiko’s famous *Hourouki* (1930), but adds "Taneiei" (seeking lust/lewdness), signaling a more erotic or "underground" focus, common in *kasutori* magazines—pulp journals named after cheap liquor that "disappeared after three cups."
*   **The Jujube (Natsume) Metaphor:** Jujubes are red, sweet fruits. In this story, they serve as a euphemism for a sexual transaction. Selling small items like matches, jujubes, or flowers was a common front for street-level prostitution in impoverished post-war Japan.
*   **Onnagata & Chōhachi:** The mention of "Chōhachi" as an *onnagata* (a male kabuki-style actor playing female roles) suggests a subculture of gender-bending and same-sex attraction ("sodomy," as the text explicitly states) that existed in the fringes of the entertainment world.
*   **"Shameful Disease":** A common euphemism for venereal diseases (STIs) like syphilis or gonorrhea, which were rampant in the post-war red-light districts.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **探淫 (Tan-ei):** A rare compound. *Tan* (seek/explore) + *Ei* (lewdness/lust). It implies a deliberate seeking out of "low" or carnal experiences.
*   **内府 (Naichi):** Literally "inner lands," referring to mainland Japan (Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, Hokkaido) as opposed to the colonies or overseas territories.
*   **コスモポリタン (Kosumoporitan):** "Cosmopolitan." Used here to describe a wanderer who feels at home nowhere and everywhere—a classic modern intellectual trope.
*   **色情狂 (Shikijōkyō):** Nymphomaniac or satyromaniac.
*   **玉 (Tama):** Literally "gem" or "ball." In the context of the sex trade, it refers to a "choice" girl or a worker.
*   **無聊 (Buryō):** Boredom, ennui, or having nothing to do. A sophisticated term often used in literature to describe a restless state of mind.
*   **判じ絵 (Panji-e):** A rebus or a "puzzle picture" popular in the Edo period where objects represent syllables to be solved. Used here metaphorically for "grotesque" or "hard to decipher" human desires.
*   **ソドミイ (Sodomii):** Sodomy. Used here to refer to male-male sexual relations, specifically in the context of the *onnagata* actor.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Squalor of the Human Condition:** The text juxtaposes "fine silken rain" with "grotesque oil smoke" and "muddy boots" on a bed. This reflects the *Buraiha* aesthetic—finding truth in the "dirt" of reality rather than in idealized morality.
*   **Misunderstanding of Social Cues:** The narrator is a "cosmopolitan" intellectual who fails to understand the local "rules" of the jujube seller. His awkwardness and subsequent shouting contrast with the nonchalant landlord, highlighting the narrator's alienation from the "real" world of the streets.
*   **Decadence and Self-Destruction:** The friend, Fumoto, ignores warnings of the "last train" (symbolizing a return to social order/responsibility) to stay in a den of "monstrous temptation." His eventual contraction of a "shameful disease" serves as a moralistic or realistic coda to the adventure.
*   **Gender and Performance:** The character Chōhachi blurs lines of gender and desire. The text describes him with "lewd flames" in his eyes, emphasizing the "unnatural" or "theatrical" nature of lust in this underworld setting.
*   **Boredom as a Motivator:** The narrator admits that "boredom" (無聊) is what drove him to seek out these experiences. This suggests that the "dissolute wandering" is not a search for pleasure, but an escape from the emptiness of modern life.
