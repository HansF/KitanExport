つた不知火身内の三下奴三人の耳に入つた。運の悪い時は仕方のないものそのうちの一人でへちやくれの甚六と言うのが、三下り半傳次と兄弟分の盃をしていた。話は折りしも、ちぼを相手に廻した手柄話の一節。よせばよいのに、おだてられての嬉しさから、尾鰭をつけての仰山な話振り。それが甚六にコチンと響いた。
「さあ――その時、わてはもう胸がスーッとして、ポキンと折られた腕を抱えて、ベン〜頭下げて帰るチボの顔、あんた達に見せてあげたかったわ……」
　夢中で話しているところへグイと割り込んだ甚六――
「ヤイ、三下り半の兄貴が腕を折られたと……嘘こけッ――手前それを見たのか？――」
　びっくりした小さいん、ギョッとしたが今更引つ込みもならず、
「わては見いへんけど、見た姐御がチャンとしているんやーッ！」
「阿呆んだら！　あることないこと喋り散らして俺等に恥かかせる気か？」
「何もあんたに……」
「やかましいやい。傳次は俺の兄貴分だぞ。チョイト賣出しや、いい気になりやがつて、小萬がなんでえ、片輪じやねえか。女はなあ、淑やかで、優しくて、女しろうて、男に好かれるのが本当の女子じや。小萬某郎（こまんぼうろう）はな、あら女子の恰好をした片輪や。女の味もしらん可哀相な女や。それにあの化物見た様な面は――見ただけでもゾーッとするわへへへ」
「ようも〜わての親分ボロ糞に云つたな。口惜（くやし）――いッ！」
　小さいんは前後の見境いもなく、カーッとのぼせて甚六の二の腕に思いきりかみついた。
「イタタ……畜生！すべた奴。よしッどうするか見ていやがれ――」
「おーい」と呼ぶとバラ／＼と現われた不知火の三下達、日頃、女業（おんなぎよう）に押され気味の鬱憤も手傳つて、いきなり小さいんの手取り足取りしたかと思うと、キヤーッと悲鳴をあげる赤い唇をグッと押えつけて、その儘
彼等の巣、本町溝池筋（ほんまちどぶいけすじ）の場口場（ばくちば）へかつぎ込んでしまった。――ホウこの女が奴の小萬の身内かい、フン可愛い面に似合わぬ末恐ろしい娘や。いっぺんヤキ入れたらんとあかん――と、寄つてたかつて無頼漢共の玩具（おもちや）にされた小さいん、ぐつたり死んだ様になつた小さいんを曳きづつて、三休橋の橋詰、柳の根方にうずもれて、曝（さら）し者になつていると云う、小萬身内にとつて、胸のカツとなる、煮えくり返る様な侮辱的大事件が起つたのである。
　半病人同然の姿で担ぎ込まれた長堀の家で、うわ言に、親分に合わす顔ない、世間様に大手（おおて）を振つて歩けなくなつたと、とぎれ／＼に泣き喚いて、昨夜の丑満刻（うしみつどき）。介抱の寝静まるを待つて、小さいんはそつと抜け出すと、長堀橋から身を投げた。
　駆けて、浮いた四ツ橋の東寄りからかけつけた使いの者の知らせで、屍体となつて水ぶくれの小さいんは戸板にのせられて哀れな変り果てた姿で還って来て――。
　今も今。黙然（もくぜん）と涙ぐむ小萬にぐつと近附いて、小勘は再び声を尖らせた。
「口惜しいじやありませんか――親分黙つてその儘泣き寝入りするんですかい――。」
　どの面々も、激しい憤りもやる方なき憤懣（ふんまん）で張り切れそうに、まなじりをつり上げていた。小さいん一人の命だけでなく、女への侮辱――。黙つて引込めぬ宿命的な男女の争いを言外に含めて、一同は小萬の顔色を窺つた。
「皆んな、分つたよ。わしに覚悟もある。誰も手出しするんじやないよ。あ（以下略）」

つたが不知火（しらぬい）身内の三下奴（さんしたやっこ）三人の耳に入った。運の悪い時は仕方のないもので、そのうちの一人でへちゃむくれの甚六（じんろく）と言うのが、三下り半の伝次と兄弟分の盃をしていた。話は折りしも、ちぼを相手に回した手柄話の一節。よせばよいのに、おだてられての嬉しさから、尾鰭（おひれ）をつけての仰山（ぎょうさん）な話振り。それが甚六にカチンと響いた。

「さあ――その時、わてはもう胸がスーッとして、ポキンと折られた腕を抱えて、ペコペコ頭を下げて帰るチボの顔、あんた達に見せてあげたかったわ……」
夢中で話しているところへグイと割り込んだ甚六――
「ヤイ、三下り半の兄貴が腕を折られたと……嘘つけッ――てめえ、それを見たのか？――」
びっくりした小さいん（小娘）、ギョッとしたが今更引っ込みもならず、
「わては見いへんけど、見た姐御（あねご）がちゃんとしているんやーッ！」
「阿呆んだら！ あることないこと喋り散らかして、俺たちに恥かかせる気か？」
「何もあんたに……」
「やかましいやい。伝次は俺の兄貴分だぞ。ちょっと売り出しやがって、いい気になりやがって。小萬（こまん）がなんだい、片輪じゃあねえか。女はなあ、淑やかで、優しくて、女らしくて、男に好かれるのが本当の女子（おなご）じゃ。小萬某郎（こまんぼうろう）はな、ありゃ女子の格好をした片輪や。女の味もしらん可哀相な女や。それにあの化物みたいな面は――見ただけでもゾーッとするわ、へへへ」
「よくも〜わての親分をボロクソに言ったな。悔しいーッ！」

小さいんは前後の見境もなく、カーッとのぼせて甚六の二の腕に思い切り噛みついた。
「痛たた……畜生！ すべた奴。よしッ、どうするか見ていやがれ――」
「おーい」と呼ぶとバラバラと現れた不知火の三下たち。日頃、女親分に押され気味の鬱憤も手伝って、いきなり小さいんの手を取り足を取りしたかと思うと、キャーッと悲鳴を上げる赤い唇をグッと押さえつけて、そのまま彼らの巣、本町溝池筋（どぶいけすじ）の賭場（ばくちば）へ担ぎ込んでしまった。

「ほう、この女が奴の小萬の身内かい。ふん、可愛い顔に似合わぬ末恐ろしい娘や。いっぺん焼き入れんといかん」――と、寄ってたかって無頼漢たちの玩具（おもちゃ）にされた小さいん。ぐったり死んだようになった小さいんを引きずって、三休橋の橋詰、柳の根元に埋もれて、晒し者（さらしもの）になっているという。小萬の身内にとって、胸がカッとなる、煮えくり返るような屈辱的な大事件が起きたのである。

半病人同然の姿で担ぎ込まれた長堀（ながほり）の家で、うわ言に「親分に合わす顔がない、世間に顔向けして歩けなくなった」と途切れ途切れに泣き叫び、昨夜の丑三つ時（うしみつどき）。介抱の者が寝静まるのを待って、小さいんはそっと抜け出すと、長堀橋から身を投げた。
駆けつけて、浮いた四ツ橋の東寄りから駆けつけた使いの者の知らせで、死体となって水膨れした小さいんは戸板に乗せられて、哀れな変わり果てた姿で戻ってきて――。

今も今。黙然（もくぜん）と涙ぐむ小萬にグッと近づいて、小勘は再び声を尖らせた。
「口惜しいじゃありませんか――親分、黙ってそのまま泣き寝入りするんですかい――。」
どの面々も、激しい憤りもやるかたなき憤懣（ふんまん）で張り切れそうに、まなじりをつり上げていた。小さいん一人の命だけでなく、女への侮辱――。黙って引き下がれぬ宿命的な男女の争いを言外に含めて、一同は小萬の顔色のうかがった。
「みんな、わかったよ。私に覚悟もある。誰も手出しするんじゃないよ。あ……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Information reached the ears of three low-ranking lackeys of the Shiranui inner-circle. When luck is bad, it cannot be helped; among them, a person called "Hechakure no Jinroku" (Flat-faced Jinroku) was sharing a brotherly cup of sake with "Sanka-ri-han no Denji" (Three-and-a-half-verse Denji). The conversation was exactly a passage of a heroic tale regarding an encounter with Chibo. Though he should have stopped, out of the joy of being flattered, he spoke with exaggeration, adding fins and a tail (embellishing). That struck Jinroku with a "clink" (irritated him).

"Well—at that time, my chest felt refreshed, and holding the arm that was snapped 'snap!', the face of Chibo returning while bowing 'bow-bow' repeatedly, I wanted to show it to you all..."
While speaking in a trance, Jinroku forced his way in—
"Hey, that Denji-big-brother had his arm broken, you say... stop lying—did you yourself see that? —"
The surprised "Chiisai-n" (the young girl) was startled, but at this point could not back down,
"I didn't see it, but the Boss-lady (Anego) who saw it is doing it properly (telling it correctly)!"
"You idiot! Spreading rumors about things that are and aren't, are you planning to make us feel ashamed?"
"Nothing to you..."
"Shut up! Denji is my elder brother-rank. He's just started becoming popular and is getting ahead of himself, and what is Koman anyway, she's just a cripple isn't she? Women, you see, should be modest, kind, feminine, and liked by men—that is a true woman. Koman-bouro is just a cripple in the shape of a woman. She's a pitiful woman who doesn't even know the taste of a woman. And that monster-like face—just looking at it makes me shiver, he-he-he."
"How dare you... speak of my boss like trash. How frustrating—!"

Chiisai-n, without looking before or after (recklessly), became flushed with anger and bit hard into Jinroku's upper arm.
"Ouch... Damn it! You bitch. Alright, watch what I do to you—"
When he called "Hey!", the lackeys of Shiranui appeared in a scramble. Mixed with their usual frustration of being suppressed by women's businesses, they suddenly grabbed Chiisai-n by hands and feet, pressed down on her red lips as she let out a "Kyaa!" scream, and just like that, carried her off to their den, the gambling den at Honmachi Dobuike-suji.

"Ho, so this girl is a member of that Koman's group? Hum, she has a terrifying potential despite her cute face. I have to give her a 'burning' (discipline/torture) once." —So, Chiisai-n was made into a toy by the gathered ruffians. Dragging the limp Chiisai-n who looked as if she were dead, she was left at the foot of Sankyu Bridge, buried at the base of a willow tree, becoming a "exposed person" (shaming). For the Shiranui inner circle, a humiliatingly major incident that made the chest "snap" (boil with rage) had occurred.

At the house in Nagahori where she was carried in looking like a half-invalid, in her delirium she cried and screamed fitfully that "I have no face to show the Boss," and "I can no longer walk in public with my head high," and then at the Hour of the Ox (late night). Waiting for the caretakers to fall asleep, Chiisai-n quietly slipped out and threw herself from Nagahori Bridge.
Running there, from the message of the messenger who arrived from the eastern side of Yotsubashi where she floated, the water-bloated Chiisai-n became a corpse, was placed on a wooden shutter, and returned in a pitiful, transformed state—.

Even now. Approaching Koman, who was silently tearful, Kokan sharpened his voice again.
"Isn't it frustrating?—Boss, are you going to just stay silent and cry yourself to sleep (let it go) like this? —"
Every face was filled with intense anger and irrepressible resentment, eyes slanted upward. Not just the life of one girl, but an insult to women—. Including the unspoken destiny of a struggle between men and women that cannot be withdrawn in silence, everyone peered at Koman's expression.
"Everyone, I understand. I have my resolve. No one is to make a move. Ah..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The rumors reached the ears of three low-level thugs belonging to the Shiranui gang. As the saying goes, when luck turns sour, there's no stopping it. One of them, a flat-faced lout named Jinroku, was sharing a ceremonial cup of sake with his sworn brother, "Three-Verse" Denji. Their talk turned to a boastful tale of a victory over a rival named Chibo. Encouraged by the flattery of his peers, Jinroku couldn't help but embellish the story, adding "fins and a tail" to his exploits. This arrogant display struck a nerve with those listening.

"And then," Jinroku bragged, "my heart felt light as a feather! You should have seen Chibo’s face—sniveling and bowing as he slunk away, cradling that arm I’d snapped like a dry twig. I wish you all could’ve been there to see it..."

Suddenly, Jinroku’s boasting was interrupted by a young girl—a protégé of the rival gang known as "Chiisai-n."
"Hey!" she shouted. "You say Denji-big-brother got his arm broken? You liar! Did you actually see it happen?"
Though startled by her own boldness, the girl couldn't back down now. 
"I didn't see it myself, but the Boss-lady saw it, and she tells it true!" 
"You little brat!" Jinroku roared. "Spreading lies to make us look like fools? Is that your game?"
"I wasn't talking to you..." she stammered.
"Shut your mouth! Denji is my superior. He's just starting to make a name for himself, and who does this 'Koman' think she is? She’s nothing but a cripple. A real woman should be graceful, gentle, and feminine—someone men can actually like. That Koman of yours? She’s a freak in a woman’s skin. A pathetic creature who doesn’t even know what it means to be a woman. And that monster face of hers—it makes my skin crawl just looking at it. Heh heh."

"How dare you!" the girl screamed. "How dare you talk about my Boss like she’s trash! I'll make you regret those words!" 
Losing all reason, her blood boiling, Chiisai-n lunged forward and sank her teeth deep into Jinroku’s arm.
"Ow! Damn you, you little bitch! Right then, you'll see what happens next—"

With a whistle, a pack of Shiranui thugs swarmed out. Fuelled by a long-simmering resentment toward being bossed around by women, they pounced on the girl. They gagged her red lips to stifle her screams and hauled her off to their lair—a gambling den in the seedy Dobuike district of Honmachi.

"So, this little thing belongs to Koman, does she? Hmph. She’s got a fierce spirit for such a pretty face. Looks like she needs a little 'discipline.'" The thugs fell upon her, treating her like a discarded toy. Later, they dragged her limp, half-dead body to the foot of Sankyu Bridge and dumped her under a willow tree for all to see—a public shaming meant to humiliate the entire Koman faction. It was a calculated, boiling insult that struck at the very heart of the gang.

When she was finally brought home to Nagahori, broken and delirious, she could only sob fitfully. "I can't face the Boss... I can't show my face in this world again," she wailed. Late that night, during the Hour of the Ox, she waited until her caregivers were asleep, slipped out, and threw herself from the Nagahori Bridge.
The news came from a messenger near Yotsubashi. Her body was found floating in the water—bloated and unrecognizable. They brought her back on a wooden shutter, a tragic shadow of the girl she had been.

Now, back at the hideout, the air was thick with grief. Kokan stepped toward Koman, who sat in stunned silence, tears streaming down her face. 
"Does this not burn your soul, Boss?" Kokan hissed, his voice sharp with rage. "Are you really going to stay silent and let them get away with this?"
The men in the room were trembling with a fury that felt like it might burst. It wasn't just the loss of the girl; it was the ultimate insult to their pride and to all women. A silent, ancient war between the sexes had been declared. Every eye turned to Koman, waiting for her word.
"I hear you all," Koman finally spoke, her voice steady. "I have made my decision. But none of you are to lift a finger. This is mine to settle."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** This is a classic example of a mid-century Japanese pulp fiction layout. The text is arranged in four vertical columns, flowing around a central illustration. The page number (91) is centered at the bottom.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of Kanji and Kana, with frequent **furigana (rubi)**. The rubi serves two purposes: identifying difficult kanji and indicating the specific Osaka dialect (e.g., rubi for "小娘" indicating it should be read as "小さいん").
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration is the focal point, designed to catch the reader's eye immediately. It depicts a woman in a "turtle" or "shell" binding (*kikkō-barami*), a staple of the *ero-guro* genre. The men surrounding her wear traditional Edo/Meiji period attire (happi coats and kimonos), suggesting a "matatabi" (wandering gambler) or "yakuza" period piece.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Dialogue is enclosed in brackets 「 」. Punctuation includes long dashes (――) for pauses or emphasis and small "tsu" (ッ) to denote abrupt stops or shouted sounds, common in dramatic storytelling.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (1950s):** The style, themes, and specific binding technique point to the post-war "Kasutori" or "Ero-Guro" magazine boom. Magazines like *Kitan Club* were famous for blending hard-boiled detective fiction, period dramas, and erotic bondage imagery.
*   **Setting (Osaka):** The text mentions specific locations in Osaka: **Nagahori**, **Yotsubashi**, **Dobuike**, and **Sankyu Bridge**. The characters speak in **Osaka-ben** (Osaka dialect), characterized by "wate" (I), "ahondara" (idiot), and "hen" (negation).
*   **Bakuto/Yakuza Culture:** The story revolves around "Shin-uchi" (inner circle) and "Sanka-yakkō" (low-level henchmen). The concepts of "Brotherhood cups" (Kyodai-bun no sakazuki) and "Face" (honor/public reputation) are central to the plot.
*   **Social Conventions of Gender:** The antagonist Jinroku expresses a misogynistic view typical of the "macho" outlaw culture of the time, arguing that a woman’s value lies solely in her modesty and femininity, dismissing the female boss (Koman) as "unnatural" or "crippled" (katawa) because she wields power.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **三下奴 (Sanka-yakko):** A derogatory term for low-ranking yakuza or gamblers; lackeys.
*   **阿呆んだら (Ahondara):** A strong Osaka-dialect insult, more intense than the standard "aho."
*   **へちゃむくれ (Hechamukure):** An old-fashioned insult for someone with a flat or ugly face.
*   **尾鰭をつけて (Ohire wo tsukete):** Idiom meaning "to add fins and a tail"—to exaggerate or embellish a story.
*   **丑満刻 (Ushimitsudoki):** The "Hour of the Ox" (approx. 2:00–2:30 AM), traditionally the time when ghosts appear or tragic events happen.
*   **すべた (Subeta):** An archaic, derogatory term for a woman, similar to "bitch" or "ugly woman."
*   **焼き入れ (Yaki-ire):** Literally "tempering" (as in steel), used as slang for "disciplining," "torturing," or "giving someone a lesson."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Honor and Humiliation:** The primary driver of the plot is "men-boku" (honor). The public shaming of the young girl is not just a personal attack but a strategic strike against the rival gang’s reputation.
*   **Misogyny vs. Female Power:** The dialogue highlights a clash between traditional patriarchal views (women must be submissive) and the reality of a female gang leader (Koman). The thugs use sexualized violence to "put a woman in her place."
*   **Tragedy of the Innocent:** The girl "Chiisai-n" acts as a sacrificial lamb. Her suicide highlights the extreme weight of social shame in the outlaw subculture; she feels that her violation has made her "unable to walk in public."
*   **The "Ero-Guro" Aesthetic:** The combination of a tragic suicide plot with a graphic illustration of bondage is characteristic of 1950s pulp. It appeals to a reader's sense of "pathos" while simultaneously providing "erotic" titillation.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
