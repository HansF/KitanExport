**第二話　それでも奥様はご存知ない**

吉野眞知子嬢が、才色兼備の淑女であるのに反し、其のお隣りに住む、運輸省建設技師の肩書を持つ、堀井さんの令室賢子さんは、皮肉にも、凡の者とは謎違い、一寸頭脳の構造がお粗末に出来ているので有名である。
　それかあらぬか、勘定高い毒舌夫人達の言を借りると、酒屋の小僧さんのカストリの詰め方が一寸足らぬと、途端に、
「あら、チョイト。これ堀井さんの奥さんだわよ」
なあんと、怪しからぬ符牒で応酬する。
　堪らないのは旦那様の堀井さんである。
　吉野さんは残念そうに、泌々と呟いた。
「あ、お母さんが居てくれたらなあ」
宣なる哉。処女の娘があれ丈の成果を掲げたのである。子供を生んだお母さんであれば、正にハンドバック的な役割を果したであろう。
「まあ、お父さまつたらニヤニヤ笑つて、厭ッ、しらないー」
眞知子さんはポッと頰を染めて拗ねて了う。吉野さんはヤッと愁眉をひらいた笑顔であつたが、それよりもつと愉快なことは、小野小町の冠称を呈したあの五月蠅い放送局連中が、急に彼女がお嫁入りする日、驟然と顔を見合せて見送つていた光景である。

通の祝電が届けられて来た。
「イワウトンネルゴカイツウ」
何と云う穿つた電文であろう。
新夫の堀井さんは、頰を火照らせて苦笑したものである。
　ところが、新妻の賢子さんは聊かの動揺の色もなく、
「貴男。トンネルつて随分とお憎いものですつてね？」
と、眉も動かさずに、シヤーとして仰言つたものである。
　かくて、和製オフェリヤは、文豪シェークスピアにおもねる事なく、三百六十五日をいとも能気嫌麗わしく、目下、第二世を懐妊遊ばされ、近き將來に於いては、アパート随一の良妻？賢母？ぶりを發揮されるであろうと、大なる期待が寄せられているのである。

**第三話　いゝえただ読んだだけですの**

　世に女性多しといえども、抦愈々美人となると、仲々そうザラにあるものではない。
　それが何うした奇蹟か偶然か此のアパートの中に、水準を超えた秀逸がある。
　詳しく身許を洗えば、元子爵綾小路ルリ子夫人が噂の女性なのだ。
　明眸コウシ、容姿タンレイ、ありとあらゆる麗人形容詞を以つてして、尚、其の上に朱の二重マルでも付けねばならぬのが彼女を讃える最も適切な表現方法なのである。
　然も、学習院女学部から女子大英文科へと高度な素養を身に着けた彼女は、其の比いなき美貌と相俟つて、先年夫を喪つたという環境は、いやが上にもアパートの異性達の関心を惹かないではない。
　貞淑にして節操堅きルリ子夫人は、日常の起居容儀は元より特に、就寝時に至つては、独身の危険をヨウ護するために、貞操帯を穿いていると云う噂。
　ところが此処に、彼女にとつては名誉毀損も甚だしい、一大不祥事がボッ發して了つた。
そも〜事件の発端と云うのは、彼女の室の眞上に当る、ア

つた。誤つて長さ四センチの留針の頭の方を下にして呑みこんだがその後四晝夜、別に異状なく、やがて肛門から糞と共に排泄された此れと反対に麦揚子を呑み込んで死んだ例がある。一人は麦揚子が胃を穿孔して肝臓に突き刺つて死に、もう一人は麦揚子が食道の壁を破つて、大動脈に突き入り内出血を起して死んだのである。

**舌を噛み切る**
舌を噛んでウーンとそのまゝ死んでしまうというのは芝居や昔の小説によく出て来るが果して舌を噛み切った位でそう簡単に死ねるものだろうか。事実、舌を噛み切つた位では中々死ねないようである。
　キッス強盗の例でも方々で舌を噛み切られた実例があつたが、それが原因で死亡したという事は聞かない。
　馬を取扱う際に、よく舌を握つて口外へ出したりする。その時、馬が嫌つて後しざりした際、舌を切ることが

**第二話：それでも奥様はご存知ない**

吉野真知子嬢が、才色兼備の淑女であるのに反し、そのお隣に住む、運輸省建設技師の肩書を持つ、堀井さんの令室・賢子（まさこ）さんは、皮肉にも、普通の人とはだいぶ違い、少々頭脳の構造がお粗末にできているので有名である。
それゆえか、勘定高い毒舌夫人たちの言葉を借りると、酒屋の小僧さんのカストリ（安酒）の詰め方がちょっと足りないと、途端に、
「あら、ちょっと。これ堀井さんの奥さんだわよ」
などと、けしからぬ隠語で応酬する。
たまらないのは旦那様の堀井さんである。
吉野さんは残念そうに、しみじみと呟いた。
「あ、お母さんがいてくれたらなあ」
もっともなことだ。未婚の娘があれほどの成果を挙げたのである。子供を産んだお母さんであれば、正にハンドバッグ的な役割（フォロー役）を果たしたであろう。
「まあ、お父様ったらニヤニヤ笑って、嫌っ、知らないー」
真知子さんはポッと頬を染めて拗ねてしまう。吉野さんはやっと愁眉を開いた（安心した）笑顔であったが、それよりももっと愉快なことは、小野小町の冠称を呈したあのうるさい放送局連中が、急に彼女がお嫁入りする日、にわかに顔を見合わせて見送っていた光景である。

一通の祝電が届けられてきた。
「イワウトンネルゴカイツウ（岩尾トンネル御開通）」
何という穿った（気の利いた）電文であろう。
新夫の堀井さんは、頬を火照らせて苦笑したものである。
ところが、新妻の賢子さんはわずかの動揺の色もなく、
「あなた。トンネルって随分とお憎い（しゃれている）ものですってね？」
と、眉も動かさずに、ケロッとしておっしゃったものである。
こうして、和製オフィーリアは、文豪シェイクスピアに媚びることなく、365日をいとも機嫌麗しく、現在、第二子を懐妊なされており、近い将来においては、アパート随一の良妻賢母ぶりを発揮されるであろうと、大きな期待が寄せられているのである。

**第三話：いいえ、ただ読んだだけですの**

世に女性多しといえども、いよいよ美人となると、なかなかそうざらにあるものではない。
それがどうした奇跡か偶然か、このアパートの中に、水準を超えた秀逸な美人がいる。
詳しく身元を洗えば、元子爵・綾小路ルリ子夫人が噂の女性なのだ。
明眸皓歯（めいぼうこうし）、容姿端麗、ありとあらゆる美人を形容する言葉を尽くしても、なお、その上に朱の二重丸でも付けねばならぬのが彼女を讃える最も適切な表現方法なのである。
しかも、学習院女学部から女子大英文科へと高度な教養を身につけた彼女は、その類まれな美貌と相まって、数年前に夫を亡くしたという環境は、いやが上にもアパートの男性たちの関心を惹かないではおかない。
貞淑にして節操の固いルリ子夫人は、日常の立ち居振る舞いはもとより、特に就寝時に至っては、独身の危険を擁護するために「貞操帯」を履いているという噂。
ところがここに、彼女にとっては名誉毀損もはなはだしい、一大不祥事が勃発してしまった。
そもそもの事件の発端というのは、彼女の部屋の真上に当たる、ア……（中略）

舌を噛んで「うーん」とそのまま死んでしまうというのは、芝居や昔の小説によく出てくるが、果たして舌を噛み切ったぐらいでそう簡単に死ねるものだろうか。事実、舌を噛み切ったぐらいではなかなか死ねないようである。

**Episode 2: Even So, the Madam Does Not Know**

Miss Machiko Yoshino is a lady of both intelligence and beauty; conversely, her neighbor, the wife of Mr. Horii (who holds the title of construction engineer for the Ministry of Transportation), Mrs. Masako, is ironically famous because, unlike ordinary people, the structure of her brain is made somewhat poorly. Because of that, to borrow the words of the calculating, sharp-tongued wives, when the liquor store delivery boy's filling of "Kasutori" (cheap booze) is a bit insufficient, they immediately respond with the scandalous code: "Oh, look. This is Mr. Horii's wife." 
The one who cannot stand it is the husband, Mr. Horii.
Mr. Yoshino muttered regretfully and deeply: "Ah, if only her mother were here."
It is true. A maiden daughter had achieved such results. If it were a mother who had given birth, she would have played a role like a handbag (supporter).
"Oh, Father, you're just grinning... No, I don't know anything!"
Machiko-san blushed and sulked. Mr. Yoshino had a smile of relief, but what was even more pleasant was the sight of those annoying broadcasting station people—who had dubbed her the "Ono no Komachi"—suddenly looking at each other and seeing her off on her wedding day.

A congratulatory telegram arrived.
"IWAO TUNNEL FULLY OPENED"
What a piercing (clever) message.
The new husband, Mr. Horii, blushed and gave a wry smile.
However, the new bride, Masako-san, without a hint of agitation, said nonchalantly with unmoving eyebrows: "Darling, they say tunnels are quite hateful (clever) things, don't they?"
Thus, the Japanese Ophelia, without flattering the great writer Shakespeare, spent 365 days in a very good mood. Currently, she is pregnant with her second child, and great expectations are held that in the near future she will demonstrate her status as the apartment's number one "Good Wife? Wise Mother?".

**Episode 3: No, I Just Read It**

Though there are many women in the world, when it comes to true beauties, they are not so common. By some miracle or chance, in this apartment, there is an excellence that exceeds the standard. 
If one examines her background in detail, the rumored woman is the former Viscountess Ruriko Ayanokouji. 
Bright eyes, white teeth, elegant posture—even using every adjective for a beautiful woman, one must still add a red double-circle to properly express her praise. 
Moreover, having acquired high culture from Gakushuin Girls' School to a Women's University English Department, her peerless beauty combined with her status as a widow who lost her husband years ago cannot help but attract the interest of the men in the apartment. 
The chaste and high-principled Mrs. Ruriko is rumored to wear a "chastity belt" to protect against the dangers of being single, especially when sleeping. 
However, here, a great scandal that is a severe defamation of her character has erupted. 
The beginning of the incident was, directly above her room, A...

(Side Column)
...There was. Someone accidentally swallowed a 4cm pin head-first, but after four days and nights, with no abnormality, it was eventually excreted with feces. In contrast, there are cases of dying from swallowing *age-dama* (fried batter). One person died when the *age-dama* perforated the stomach and stabbed the liver; another died when it broke the wall of the esophagus and entered the aorta, causing internal bleeding.

**Biting off the Tongue**
Dying with a groan after biting one's tongue is something that often appears in plays and old novels, but can one really die so easily just by biting off the tongue? In fact, it seems one cannot die easily just from biting off the tongue. 
Even in cases of "Kissing Bandits" where tongues were bitten off in various places, we have not heard of deaths resulting from it. 
When handling horses, one often grasps the tongue to pull it out of the mouth. At that time, if the horse dislikes it and recoils, cutting the tongue...

**Story Two: The Madam Remains Blissfully Unaware**

While Miss Machiko Yoshino is the very picture of a refined and talented lady, her neighbor—Mrs. Masako Horii, wife of a Ministry of Transportation engineer—is ironically famous for being a bit "slow." She is known for having a brain that isn't quite firing on all cylinders. This has led the neighborhood's sharp-tongued gossips to use her name as a cruel shorthand; whenever the delivery boy brings a bottle of *Kasutori* liquor that isn't quite full, they smirk and say, "Oh, look at that—it’s a 'Mrs. Horii' bottle."

Her husband, naturally, finds this unbearable. Meanwhile, Mr. Yoshino sighed with regret, "If only her mother were still with us." It was a fair sentiment. For a young maiden to achieve such success in the marriage market, a mother's guidance would have been the perfect "handbag"—the essential accessory to complete the task. "Oh, Father! Stop grinning like that. I don't want to hear it!" Machiko protested, her cheeks flushing as she pouted. Mr. Yoshino’s face finally cleared into a relieved smile. His greatest satisfaction, however, was seeing the stunned faces of those annoying radio reporters—who had nicknamed her the modern "Ono no Komachi"—as they stood speechless on her wedding day.

A congratulatory telegram arrived for the newlyweds: "IWAO TUNNEL FULLY OPENED." It was a double-entendre, a clever nod to the "consummation" of the marriage. The groom, Mr. Horii, blushed and offered a strained smile. But Masako, the bride, didn't bat an eye. "Darling," she said with total nonchalance, "isn't it clever how they talk about tunnels these days?"

And so, this "Japanese Ophelia," blissfully indifferent to the dramatic tragedies of Shakespeare, spends every day in high spirits. Currently expecting her second child, the residents of the apartment building watch with great anticipation to see if she will truly become the "Good Wife and Wise Mother" she is purported to be.

**Story Three: "Oh No, I Simply Read About It..."**

Beauties are common enough, but a truly exceptional woman is a rarity. Yet, by some miracle, one such paragon resides in this very apartment. She is Mrs. Ruriko Ayanokouji, the widow of a former Viscount. With her radiant eyes and porcelain teeth, no amount of flowery adjectives can do her justice; she deserves a double-red circle of excellence. Having been educated at the prestigious Gakushuin and studied English Literature, her pedigree and her status as a young widow make her the absolute center of attention for every man in the building.

Rumor has it that the virtuous Ruriko is so protective of her chastity that she wears a "chastity belt" to bed every night. But then, a scandal erupted—a catastrophic blow to her reputation. It all started in the room directly above hers...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is structured in a traditional vertical-text format (*tategaki*), typical of Japanese periodicals. It features two distinct "stories" or gossip columns, separated by a thin vertical line.
*   **Typography:** The headers use a bold, stylized serif font typical of the mid-20th century. The main body text uses a standard Mincho typeface. There is frequent use of *furigana* (ruby text) to provide readings for difficult kanji or to add specific nuances (e.g., "賢子" read as "まさこ").
*   **Illustrations:**
    *   The top illustration depicts a domestic scene with a man looking exasperated and an elegant woman, matching the "Second Episode." The style is "Heta-uma" or early manga-sketch style, common in pulp magazines.
    *   The second illustration shows a man looking shocked while a woman (presumably the widow Ruriko) appears to be in a suggestive or distressed pose, likely relating to the "chastity belt" or the "tongue biting" discussion.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Large bold titles for each "Episode" (第二話, 第三話), with sub-headings or side-bars for trivia ("Biting off the Tongue"). The page number (71) is at the bottom right.
*   **Columns:** The text is dense, with little margin, suggesting a low-cost "Kasutori" magazine where maximizing content per page was essential.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-WWII 1940s-1950s):** This era was the heyday of "Kasutori magazines." These were cheap, low-quality periodicals (named after *Kasutori* liquor, which was said to make you sick after three rounds, just as these magazines supposedly folded after three issues). They mixed gossip, soft erotica, and urban legends.
*   **Kasutori (カストリ):** Mentioned in the text as a metaphor for being "not quite all there." *Kasutori* was a cheap, often dangerous, home-distilled liquor common in the black markets of post-war Japan.
*   **Gakushuin (学習院):** Mentioned regarding Ruriko. This was the school for the imperial family and the peerage (*kazoku*). Referencing it immediately establishes a character as "high class" or "aristocratic," which adds a layer of "fallen nobility" drama to the story.
*   **Good Wife, Wise Mother (Ryousai Kenbo):** A traditional Japanese ideal for women. The text uses it ironically/questioningly (良妻？賢母？) to mock the "slow" neighbor.
*   **Iwao Tunnel:** This likely refers to a real infrastructure project of the time, used here as a sexual double-entendre in the telegram.
*   **Tongue Biting (Shita o kamikiru):** A common trope in Japanese theater (Kabuki) and historical novels where a character commits suicide by biting their tongue. The text debunks this as a medical impossibility, reflecting a transition from "samurai-era myths" to "modern scientific knowledge."

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **才色兼備 (Saishoku Kenbi):** A woman gifted with both intelligence and beauty.
*   **令室 (Reishitsu):** A polite way to refer to someone else's wife.
*   **お粗末 (O-somatsu):** Poor quality, crude, or (in this case) "weak-minded."
*   **符牒 (Fuchou):** A code word or secret jargon used within a specific group.
*   **愁眉をひらく (Shuubi o hiraku):** To look relieved (literally "to open one's distressed eyebrows").
*   **明眸皓歯 (Meibou Koushi):** "Bright eyes and white teeth"—a classic Chinese-derived idiom for a beautiful woman.
*   **和製オフェリヤ (Wasei Oferiya):** "Japanese-made Ophelia." A reference to Shakespeare's tragic character, used here to mock the woman's perceived "madness" or lack of wit.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Class Tension:** The contrast between the "perfect" girl next door and the "aristocratic" widow vs. the "slow-witted" neighbor reflects a fascination with social status in the post-war shuffle.
*   **Double Entendre & Innuendo:** The "tunnel" telegram and the "chastity belt" rumor are classic examples of the "ero-guro-nansensu" (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) genre that permeated early post-war publishing.
*   **Misogyny and Gossip:** The text is heavily framed through the "gaze" of the neighborhood gossips. Women are categorized as either "perfect," "idiots," or "scandalous."
*   **Rationalism vs. Tradition:** The sidebar about tongue biting and swallowing pins represents the era's interest in "scientific" trivia, debunking old-fashioned dramatic tropes with "real-life" (albeit often dubious) medical anecdotes.
