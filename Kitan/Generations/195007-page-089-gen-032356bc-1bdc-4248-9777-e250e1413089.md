**[第五十四話 小川君の話]**
何にしろ表を通っただけでは、ジャンジャン甘いスイングが鳴り響いて、さも景気よさそうで、看板には
「麗人のハートは震えて、貴方のお越しを切なく待ちかねて居ります」
「まあ、お久し振り、いらっしゃいー」
なんだからね。
と出掛けた。
扉を開けて入って見ると、たった十二三人ー。それが揃いも揃って、くたびれた可笑しな御面相の連中ばかり。仄明かい電球の下で、鳥肌立てゝ人待顔に坐っている。
始めての筈だと考えたが、野暮な事、それが向うの術らしい。忽ち、帽子とり、外套を奪い、手とり足とり、命までとも、クッションへ連れ込むと半裸の女、全裸に近い娘がグルリとボクを取り巻く。テヘッ、三百円のつもりなんだがなあーー。
と心細くなってオズオズ例の三百円の口を切り出すと、持って来たのが、薄いコーヒーと干乾びた生菓子が二片。
「ねェ、おビールにしなさいよ。私のみたいの、じゃあお通して来るわねー。」
何も言わない先ビールが、ジャン〜〜栓を抜かれて人の気も知らないで、泡を吹いている。泡を喰ったのはボクー。
「ト、トンデモないッ、」
ゲッソとしたとたん乳バンドだけの黒いドレスの女が膝にのりかゝってくる。肉体は穢れてこそ魅力を感じるものとつくづく知ったね。
三四人の女の子が寄ってたかつてグリグリ皿の様な乳房を胸に押しつける。トホッ、
「五百人はどうなったの？」
「唯今、増員中なの……」
イカレタ。
やがて勇猛果敢なのが盛んに、ボクにタックルを挑んでくる。辛うじて勘定を頼んだらしめて三千八百円也。
若し二階のスペシャル。ルームへでも連れ込まれたら、ボクの一ヶ月分の給料は軽く飛んでしまうところだった。
三百円の筈が三千いくら、一桁ぐらい間違えて、ボクは身も心もとろけるどころか、シャチコバッテ飛び出した次第さ。

こんだ死亡廣告
あいっ程、女にモテなかった奴も珍しいよ。なまじ文学かぶれをして、小才を鼻にかける癖と、女の腐った様な男娼顔負けのヘナ〜した物腰は、いかなる女も一度でアイソをつかしてしまったらしい。
女はやっぱり男らしい男が好きなんだね。たった一度でいゝから真実の戀がしてみたいとは奴の口癖だったが、最近僕等のグループからいつか姿を消してしまった。
春雨のビショ〜〜と降りつゞく寒戀しい黄昏。——満員電車に揉み苦茶にされながら先刻買った夕刊新聞をやっとの思いで拡げてフト廣告欄を見た途端ボクは思わずハッとして目を凝らした。
「愚息春夫儀、此度藥石効有り三月二十六日死去致しました。平生の御厚誼謹云々……」
の死亡廣告。奴さんとうとう往生したのかとー。一沫の淋しさの中に、文面の”藥石効有り”が正に怪しい。気になるので捨てゝもおけず、その足で彼の家にお悔みに出かけた。
「お恥しい次第じゃが、春夫の奴、北の私娼窟の女と心中しましてのう、ごつい男の出来そこないのような女のどことがよかったのか。始めて真の戀をしたから一緒にしてくれと申しましたが、アンタ阿呆らしい。まさかパンパンのそれを真に受ける。撰った醜女を何んば何んでも嫁に出来ますかいな。その擧句がアドルム錠を二百錠も飲みよりまして」
成程、それなら藥石効有るわけだ。正直なおヤジさんだ。それにしたも春夫の奴、女のような所作神経が相手に男勝りの女を見出した時、色情倒錯の果、無我夢中になったものらしい。
パン助と一生一度の戀か、奴らしいわいとボクはつくゞ〜とその薬石効有りの五文字に見入っていたよ。

**【第五十四話：小川君の話】**
とにかく表を通っただけでは、ジャンジャン甘いスイングが鳴り響いて、さも景気が良さそうで、看板には「麗人のハートは震えて、貴方のお越しを切なく待ちかねております」「まあ、お久しぶり、いらっしゃい」などと書いてあるものだから、つい出かけた。
扉を開けて入ってみると、たった十二、三人。それが揃いも揃って、くたびれたおかしな顔つきの連中ばかり。薄暗い電球の下で、鳥肌を立てて人待ち顔に座っている。
初めてだろうと考えたが、野暮なことだ、それが向こうの術らしい。たちまち、帽子を取り、外套を奪い、手取り足取り、命までと言わんばかりにクッションへ連れ込むと、半裸の女や全裸に近い娘がぐるりと僕を取り巻く。「テヘッ、三百円のつもりなんだけどなあ」と心細くなって、おずおず例の三百円の話を切り出すと、持ってきたのが薄いコーヒーと干からびた生菓子が二片。
「ねえ、おビールにしなさいよ。私のおごりみたいに、じゃあお通し持ってくるわね」
何も言わないうちにビールがジャンジャン栓を抜かれて、こちらの気も知らないで泡を吹いている。泡を食ったのは僕の方だ。「ト、トンデモないっ！」
げっそりした途端、乳バンドだけの黒いドレスの女が膝に乗りかかってくる。肉体は汚れてこそ魅力を感じるものだとつくづく知った。三、四人の女の子が寄ってたかってグリグリ皿のような乳房を胸に押し付ける。「トホホ、五百人はどうなったの？」「ただいま、増員中なの……」イカれた。
やがて勇猛果敢なのが盛んに、僕にタックルを挑んでくる。辛うじて勘定を頼んだら、締めて三千八百円也。もし二階のスペシャルルームへでも連れ込まれたら、僕の一ヶ月分の給料は軽く飛んでしまうところだった。三百円のつもりが三千いくら、一桁ぐらい間違えて、僕は身も心もとろけるどころか、しゃちこばって飛び出した次第さ。

**【この度の死亡広告】**
あいつほど、女にモテなかった奴も珍しいよ。なまじ文学かぶれをして、小才を鼻にかける癖と、女の腐ったような男娼顔負けのへなへなした物腰は、いかなる女も一度で愛想を尽かしてしまったらしい。
女はやっぱり男らしい男が好きなんだね。「たった一度でいいから真実の恋がしてみたい」とは奴の口癖だったが、最近僕らのグループからいつの間にか姿を消してしまった。
春雨がびしょびしょと降り続く、寒々しい黄昏。満員電車に揉みくちゃにされながら、先刻買った夕刊をやっとの思いで広げて、ふと広告欄を見た途端、僕は思わずハッとして目を凝らした。
「愚息春夫儀、この度薬石効あり三月二十六日死去いたしました。平生の御厚誼に感謝し謹んで……」
という死亡広告。奴さん、とうとう往生したのかと。一抹の寂しさの中に、文面の「薬石効あり」が正に怪しい。気になるので捨ててもおけず、その足で彼の家にお悔やみに出かけた。
「お恥ずかしい次第だが、春夫の奴、北の私娼窟の女と心中しましてな。ごつい男の出来損ないのような女のどこが良かったのか。『初めて真の恋をしたから一緒にしてくれ』と言いましたが、あんた阿呆らしい。まさかパンパンの言葉を真に受けるとは。選りすぐった醜女をいくらなんでも嫁にできますかいな。その挙句、アドルム錠を二百錠も飲みまして」
なるほど、それなら「薬石効あり（薬が効いた）」というわけだ。正直な親父さんだ。それにしても春夫の奴、女のような所作の男が、相手に男勝りの女を見出した時、色情倒錯の果てに無我夢中になったものらしい。
パン助と一生一度の恋か。奴らしいわいと、僕はつくづくその「薬石効あり」の五文字に見入っていたよ。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Episode 54: Ogawa-kun's Story]**
Anyway, just passing by the front, "jang-jang" sweet swing music was ringing out, as if business was booming, and on the sign it said "A beautiful woman's heart is trembling, waiting painfully for your arrival" and "Well, long time no see, come in," and so I went out.
When I opened the door and looked in, only twelve or thirteen people. They were all, without exception, a crowd of tired, strange faces. Under the dim lightbulbs, standing with goosebumps, sitting with faces waiting for someone.
I thought it must be the first time, but how unrefined of me, that seems to be their tactic. Suddenly, taking my hat, stealing my overcoat, taking me by hand and foot, as if for my very life, they pulled me onto a cushion, and semi-naked women, girls nearly fully naked, surrounded me. "Tehe, I only intended to spend 300 yen, though..."
Becoming uneasy, I timidly broached the subject of the usual 300 yen, and what they brought was weak coffee and two pieces of dried-up sweets.
"Hey, have a beer. Just like mine, well, I'll bring the appetizer then."
Before saying anything, the beers were "jang-jang" uncorked, and not knowing my feelings, they were blowing foam. The one "eating foam" (taken aback) was me.
"T-That's ridiculous!"
The moment I was dejected, a woman in a black dress with only a breast-band climbed onto my lap. I truly learned that flesh is charming specifically because it is tainted. Three or four girls flocked together and pressed breasts like round plates against my chest. "Tohoho, what happened to the '500 people'?" "We are currently... increasing staff..." Crazy.
Eventually, a brave and daring one actively challenged me to a "tackle." When I managed to ask for the bill, it totaled 3,800 yen. If I had been taken to the "special room" on the second floor, one month of my salary would have easily flown away. Instead of the intended 300 yen, it was 3,000-something—off by about a digit—and far from my heart and body melting, I jumped out stiff as a board.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Episode 54: Ogawa’s Night Out**
Whenever I walked past the place, the air was thick with the lively, sweet sounds of swing music. It looked like the height of prosperity. The signs outside beckoned: "A beauty’s heart trembles as she piteously awaits your arrival," or "My, long time no see! Do come in." Tempted by the promise, I finally ventured inside.

But once I opened the door, there were only a dozen or so people—and what a motley crew they were! Every single one of them had a tired, bizarre face, sitting there under the dim glare of bare lightbulbs with gooseflesh, waiting expectantly. I’d thought it was my lucky break, but that was my own naivety; it was just their bait. In a flash, they snatched my hat, peeled off my overcoat, and ushered me—hand, foot, and soul—onto a cushion. Suddenly, I was surrounded by a swarm of semi-naked women and girls wearing almost nothing at all. "Heh... I only planned on spending 300 yen," I thought, my heart sinking. When I timidly mentioned my 300-yen budget, all they brought was a cup of watery coffee and two withered pieces of candy.

"Oh, come now, have a beer!" one said. "Let’s pretend it’s on me. I’ll go grab some snacks." Before I could utter a word of protest, beer bottles were being uncorked with reckless abandon. The beer was foaming over, but I was the one foaming at the mouth in shock. "W-Wait, this is outrageous!" I stammered.

The moment I looked dejected, a woman in a black dress—wearing nothing but a flimsy breast-band underneath—plopped herself onto my lap. I realized then that there’s a certain charm to the flesh precisely because it's so tawdry. Three or four girls crowded in, pressing their plate-like breasts against my chest. "Wait," I whimpered, "what happened to the '500 beauties' promised outside?" "Oh, we’re... currently expanding our staff," they replied. It was madness.

Soon, the most aggressive of the lot began practically tackling me. When I finally managed to ask for the check, the total came to a staggering 3,800 yen. If they had managed to drag me into one of those "special rooms" upstairs, a whole month's salary would have vanished into thin air. I had gone in expecting a 300-yen night, but they added an extra zero to the price. Instead of my heart melting with romance, I bolted out of there, stiff with terror.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The page is divided into multiple short anecdotes or "episodes," a common format in post-war humor magazines. The text is arranged in vertical columns, reading right-to-left. 
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century Japanese printing. Headlines are slightly larger and bolder. The text uses a mix of modern and historical kanji/kana forms (e.g., using 廣告 for *kōkoku* and 藥石 for *yakuseki*).
*   **Illustrations:** There are several cartoonish, satirical illustrations interspersed with the text. One depicts a man in bed (likely Haruo) with the caption mentioning "200 tablets of Adorm." Another shows a man being accosted by women in a cabaret setting, with the caption "Obi tokee" (loosen your sash), a traditional trope of seduction or forced intimacy.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Titles of episodes (e.g., 第五十四話) are placed at the bottom or top of their respective sections to delineate the start and end of specific stories. The layout is somewhat cramped, reflecting the low-budget "Kasutori" style.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term "Kasutori" refers to cheap, mass-produced magazines that appeared in the years following WWII (roughly 1946–1952). They were known for being "trashy" (Kasutori is a dregs-based shochu that makes you sick after three cups—hence magazines that lasted only three issues were called Kasutori). They focused on the "Three S's": Speed, Sensationalism, and Sex.
*   **Pan-pan Girls & Cabarets:** Post-war Japan saw the rise of street-walking prostitutes known as "Pan-pan girls" and shady cabarets. These establishments often used predatory pricing (as seen in Ogawa's story), luring men in with low prices and then charging exorbitant fees for snacks and drinks.
*   **Adorm (アドルム):** This was a brand of Bromvalerylurea, a popular sedative and sleeping pill in post-war Japan. It became notorious in popular culture for being the drug of choice for "shinjū" (double suicide) or individual suicide attempts among the disillusioned youth.
*   **Après-guerre (アプレ派):** Referring to the "Post-war Generation," this term was used to describe youth who rejected traditional Japanese values, often exhibiting nihilistic, hedonistic, or delinquent behavior.
*   **Naked Jizo (Hadaka Jizo):** The story in Episode 55 refers to the Denko-ji temple in Nara, which houses a famous "Hadaka Jizo" statue. The humorous claim that the statue "gave birth" plays on the statue's unique anatomical realism.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **薬石効有り (Yakuseki kou ari):** A formal phrase meaning "medical treatment was effective." Ironically used here: the father is glad the suicide medicine "worked" so he didn't have to deal with his son's scandalous marriage to a prostitute.
*   **泡を喰う (Awa o kuu):** Literally "to eat bubbles/foam," an idiom meaning to be flustered, startled, or taken aback. The author uses it as a pun on the actual beer foam.
*   **乳バンド (Chichi-band):** An early, colloquial term for a bra or a simple bandeau worn by cabaret girls.
*   **シャチコバッテ (Shachikobatte):** From *shachikobaru*, to be stiff, formal, or tense. It evokes the image of a *shachihoko* (gargoyle fish).
*   **パン助 (Pan-suke):** A derogatory variation of "Pan-pan girl."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Economic Desperation vs. Consumerism:** Ogawa's story highlights the predatory nature of the post-war entertainment industry. The gap between 300 yen (a modest treat) and 3,800 yen (a month's salary) illustrates the precariousness of the salaryman's life.
*   **Nihilism & Tragedy:** Haruo’s story is a dark comedy. His inability to find "true love" leads him to a "distorted" obsession with a tough woman from the red-light district, ending in a suicide that his own father views with cynical detachment.
*   **Subversion of Tradition:** The mention of the "Naked Jizo" giving birth and the reference to "Après-guerre" youth shows a society where even sacred symbols are subject to the irreverent, sometimes vulgar humor of the time.
*   **Masculinity in Crisis:** Both male protagonists are depicted as weak or victimized by women—one financially "tackled" by cabaret girls, the other socially "effeminate" and ultimately destroyed by his own romantic delusions.
