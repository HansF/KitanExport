**蛇の魔性傳説**
**後藤二三夫**

焔のように赤くて細長い舌、瞬きもしないまん圓い眼、屈伸が自由でどんな狭いすき間でも潜りこみ、壁でも柱にでも旬いのぼる体、自分の何倍もある大きさの動物でも一呑みにするしたたかさ。いやに黄味がかつて、キラ〜光る鱗のある腹、冷たく何時も濡れている肌、数えあげれば、いくらでもある蛇の嫌さ。
蛇を嫌いと言わぬ人があれば、それは變態的な病人と言ってよい。
蛇を嫌うのは、ただ人間ばかりでなく、猿でも鼠でも、燕、雀なんかの小鳥類もヒドク恐れる、それは彼等の仔や卵をとって喰うからである。
けれども人間が蛇嫌いなのは、陰険で執念深く、また淫蕩でもあるからである。女を狙い時としてはその生血を吸うこともある。
今昔物語集や雨月物語の蛇性の淫に表われた蛇を見ると一様に淫蕩である。
蛇が若い女の××の中に入ったりまた女を眠らせて此れを蕩らかすことは田舎ではよくある。東京の山ノ手の某妻女が、その為に死んだと言う話さえある。
蛇が若い女を眠らせると、その女は必ず好男子と戀を語っている夢を見ている。蛇がその女の肌に觸れた時には夢心地は又一段と進んでゆくものである。

岡山縣の或る町の郊外に、若い後家があった。まだ子供もなかったこととて、初々しい姿であった。
夏の夜、寢床へ入つて暫くして一人の好男子の青年の訪問をうけた。彼女にはまだ一度も逢つたことのない此の附近ではついぞ見かけない立派な服装の男であつた。
そして彼女は、何時の間にか夢幻の境にさまよいながら、死んだ夫が在世中も味った事のない痺れる様な快感の中に、その男と戀を語るのである。
翌る朝、起きて蚊帳をたたむとき蚊帳の裾の下から、二尺余りの蛇がはい出てきたので、大きい聲を出した。蛇は姑の手によつて、庭へ追い出された。
その翌朝も又蛇が蚊帳の下から現れたが、今度は彼女は一向に驚かないで、聲を立てずに、シッシッと言つて白い素足で蛇を縁側の外へ追い立てていた。
今まで血色がよく肥つていた彼女は、追々顔色が惡く痩せてきた。
或る夜、姑が芝居見物に行って、夜晚くなつて歸つてきて、彼女の寢窓の傍を通ると、蚊帳の吊紐に四尺余りの青大将がぶら下つているのを見つけて、アッと大聲を出した。
その聲は近所の人々も目を覺ますほどであつたが、彼女は默つて眠つていた。
蛇はスルスルと蚊帳の上へ滑り上つた様であつたが、ソレつきり姿が見えなくなつた。
姑はどなつて嫁を起き上らせ二人で蚊帳をたたんで室内を捜査したけれども、遂に蛇の行方は知れなかつた。
その日彼女は、寢入つてから恍惚とした夢の中で、いつもの男と變つた青年の訪問を受けて、楽しい語らいに入ろうとした時、姑に起されたのであった。
その後も又蛇が彼女の寢室で見られた事があつた。それで彼女は離婚になった。

**Legends of the Serpent’s Demonic Nature**
**By Fumio Gotō**

With a long, thin tongue as red as flame and round, unblinking eyes, the snake possesses a body that can bend and stretch at will, slithering into the narrowest of crevices and scales walls and pillars with ease. It has the tenacity to swallow animals many times its own size in a single gulp. From its unpleasantly yellowish, shimmering belly to its cold, perpetually damp skin, the list of reasons to loathe the serpent is endless. If there is anyone who claims not to hate snakes, they might well be considered a perverted soul.

It is not only humans who despise them; monkeys, mice, and small birds like swallows and sparrows live in terror of them, for the snake devours their young and their eggs. Yet, the human hatred of snakes stems from something deeper: their reputation for being devious, relentless, and intensely lewd. They are known to stalk women, and at times, even drink their fresh blood. Whether in the *Konjaku Monogatari* or the "Lust of the White Serpent" from *Ugetsu Monogatari*, the serpents depicted are invariably driven by carnal desire.

In the countryside, one often hears tales of snakes entering a young woman's private parts or casting a spell of sleep to seduce her. There is even a story of a certain wife in the Yamanote district of Tokyo who died from such an encounter. When a snake lulls a young woman into sleep, she invariably dreams of trysting with a handsome man. If the snake touches her skin, her dreamlike ecstasy deepens into a profound trance.

* * *

In the suburbs of a town in Okayama Prefecture, there lived a young widow. Having no children, she still possessed a youthful and innocent charm. One summer night, shortly after she had retired to her bed, she was visited by a handsome young man. He was a stranger to her, a man of noble bearing and fine attire, the likes of whom had never been seen in those parts.

Wandering in a state of dreamlike illusion, she found herself whispering words of love to him, experiencing a numbing, electric pleasure that she had never known even when her late husband was alive. The next morning, as she folded her mosquito net, a snake over two feet long slithered out from beneath the hem. She cried out in alarm, and her mother-in-law chased the creature out into the garden.

The following morning, the snake appeared again. This time, however, the woman showed no fear. Without making a sound, she simply shushed it and used her bare white feet to herd the serpent out onto the veranda. The woman, who had previously been healthy and full-figured, began to grow pale and thin.

One night, the mother-in-law returned late from the theater. As she passed the daughter-in-law’s room, she saw an *Aodaishō* (rat snake) over four feet long dangling from the cords of the mosquito net. She let out a scream loud enough to wake the neighbors. Yet, the daughter-in-law remained in a deep, silent sleep. The snake seemed to slither up over the net and vanish into thin air. Despite a thorough search, no trace of it was found. That night, the woman had been in the midst of an ecstatic dream, about to enjoy a pleasant conversation with a different handsome youth, when her mother-in-law’s scream jolted her awake. After several more sightings of the snake in her room, the woman was eventually divorced.

In a rural village in Shimane Prefecture, there was a horse-cart driver named Denroku. One summer day, he went deep into the mountains to cut fodder, wearing only straw sandals on his bare feet. During a break, he sat at the base of a tree, smoking tobacco and gazing at the sky. He felt a prickly sensation on the ball of his right big toe. Looking down, he saw a black snake about three feet long licking his toe with its tongue. Finding it amusing, he watched as the snake opened its mouth and began to swallow his thick thumb. "What a stupid beast," he thought, puffing on his pipe. To his surprise, the snake effortlessly swallowed his toe up to the base and began to mouth the toe next to it. That, too... [Text ends]

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The text follows the traditional Japanese vertical layout (*tate-gaki*). The title is set in a large, bold, slightly stylized typeface to grab attention. The author's name is smaller, placed just below the title.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page uses a clear hierarchy: a large title, followed by an introductory essay, and then specific "anecdotes" or "case studies" separated by triple-asterisk dividers (*fuseji* style crosses).
*   **Illustration:** A hand-drawn illustration of a coiled snake occupies the top right corner. The style is somewhat realistic but slightly sinister, emphasizing the "demonic" theme.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is divided into three vertical blocks/columns. This is typical of magazine formatting to make long texts easier to read.
*   **Censorship/Symbols:** The use of "××" in the second paragraph is a common historical practice in Japanese publishing to omit words deemed too explicit (likely "股間" or "まんこ" in this context).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** This text likely dates from the **late 1940s to the 1950s**. This was a period in Japanese publishing where "Kasutori" magazines and similar pulp publications flourished, often focusing on "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense), folklore, and scandalous anecdotes.
*   **Literary References:** 
    *   **Konjaku Monogatari (Late Heian Period):** A collection of over 1,000 tales, many involving the supernatural and animals.
    *   **Ugetsu Monogatari (1776):** Specifically "Jasei no In" (Lust of the White Serpent) by Ueda Akinari. This is the definitive Japanese ghost story about a snake-woman who seduces a man, reinforcing the "lewd snake" trope.
*   **Folk Beliefs:** The text taps into deep-seated Japanese folk beliefs about snakes as *yōkai* or deities (*kami*) associated with water and fertility, but also with obsession and jealousy. The idea that a snake can take the form of a handsome man to seduce women is a recurring motif in Japanese legends (e.g., the *Miwa-yama* legend).
*   **Rural vs. Urban:** The stories contrast "Tokyo's Yamanote" (high class) with rural "Okayama" and "Shimane," suggesting that these "demonic" occurrences happen everywhere, regardless of modernization.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **魔性 (Mashō):** Demonic nature, devilishness, or a bewitching, irresistible charm.
*   **淫蕩 (Intō):** Lewdness, debauchery, or lasciviousness. A very strong word used throughout to link snakes with sexual deviance.
*   **後家 (Goke):** An old-fashioned term for a widow.
*   **蚊帳 (Kaya):** Mosquito net. A central prop in Japanese summer ghost stories and erotic literature, representing a private, semi-transparent space.
*   **青大将 (Aodaishō):** The Japanese Rat Snake. Common and non-venomous, but often associated with being the "guardian" of a house or, in this case, a supernatural intruder.
*   **馬力挽 (Bariki-hiki):** A horse-cart driver. This occupation suggests a lower-class, rugged character, contrasting with the refined widow in the previous story.
*   **秣刈り (Magusa-kari):** Cutting fodder (grass) for livestock.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eroticism and Fear:** The primary theme is the connection between the "disgusting" physical nature of the snake and a "forbidden" sexual attraction. The snake serves as a phallic symbol and a supernatural "lover."
*   **Loss of Vitality:** The young widow becoming "pale and thin" is a classic trope of supernatural seduction (succubus/vampire dynamics), where the spirit drains the life force of the victim.
*   **Animism:** The stories reflect a world where the boundary between the human and animal/supernatural realms is porous.
*   **Misogyny/Control:** There is an underlying subtext of controlling female sexuality. The widow's "deviancy" (being seduced by a snake) leads to her being divorced and cast out, framing her as the victim of her own "demonic" nature or susceptibility.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay, Folklore, Pulp Fiction/Anecdote.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Supernatural, Eroticism, Snakes, Japanese Folklore, Urban Legends, Shōwa Era, Ghost Stories (*Kaidan*).
*   **Classification:** Intermediate/Literary (due to older kanji and specific cultural references).
