## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Witty Oneiromancer**
By Yoshiki Yamamoto

*   **Dreaming of a Barren Peak:** Expect unrequited love—after all, the object of your affection has "no wood" (no interest) in you.
*   **Dreaming of a Fire:** Your lover will be thrilled—things are about to get "hot" between you.
*   **Dreaming of Finding Money:** You’ll make your girlfriend swoon—mostly because you’ll be clutching her as tight as a coin.
*   **Dreaming of Rain:** Prepare for a breakup—you’ve officially been "rained on" (dumped).
*   **Dreaming of a Great Serpent:** You’ll marry a formidable woman—mainly because she looks like she’s about to swallow you whole.

*   He is glaring at the dinner bill.
*   He is locked in a kiss.
*   He is losing at gambling.
*   He sees his lover chatting with another man.
*   He is pretending to understand classical music.
*   He is dead.

**Marital Matchups**
*   **Marry a Cobbler:** He’ll never let you run out of "soles" (or cash).
*   **Marry a Miller:** You’re guaranteed a "fair-skinned" child (or a bag of white flour).
*   **Marry a Lantern Maker:** Your home life will be "brilliant."
*   **Marry a Rice-Cake Maker:** Life will be a mix of "baking" (jealousy) and "puffing up" (sulking).
*   **Marry a Photographer:** You’ll suffer from his "fickleness" (focusing issues).
*   **Marry a Fishmonger:** He’ll love you "more and more" (trout and sweetfish).
*   **Marry a Pharmacist:** He might have a "bitter" expression, but his heart is the best medicine.

**The Massage Scam**
"Dad, you're home!"
"I am, son."
"Hey Dad, want me to tell you a secret about Mom?"
"What? Did she do something while I was out?"
"Maybe... but secrets cost ten yen."
"Fine, here. Spill it."
"Well, Mom called over that man who always walks past our house..."
"Go on..."
"That's another twenty yen."
"Fine! Here. Then what?"
"She brought him inside and took him upstairs..."
"And?! Here's thirty yen!"
"Then she took his hand and led him into the guest room."
"The guest room?! That's outrageous! Here's forty yen, tell me the rest!"
"They went in and laid out the futon..."
"The futon?! This is terrible! Here, fifty yen! What did he do!?"

*   **A Fading Memory of Flavor:** A high-class courtesan.
*   **Chewed and Spit Out:** Chewing gum (or a toxic fling).
*   **Overpriced Seasonal Fruit:** A virgin—expensive regardless of the actual taste.

*   **Strawberry Soda for a Hangover:** A cabaret dancer.
*   **A Plain Cup of Tea:** A loyal wife.

---

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into multiple small sections using thin dashed lines and decorative borders. It follows a vertical orientation, common in Japanese periodicals.
*   **Typography:** A mix of hand-drawn title fonts (like the stylized "洒落夢判断" with a bed icon) and standard lead type for the body text.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Titles are boxed or bolded to separate the jokes from the "dream interpretation" and riddles. The use of symbols like △ and ○ denotes different entries within a category.
*   **Illustrations:** Minimalist, slightly crude sketches—a bed for the dream section and a woman's legs/shoes for the marriage section—add to the "kasutori" (pulp) aesthetic.
*   **Column Structure:** The bottom half is split into three main columns: a dialogue-heavy joke, a "Marriage" pun list, and a metaphorical commentary on women.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War 1940s-50s):** The mention of "Pan-pan" (パンパン) is a significant chronological marker. These were street prostitutes who catered to occupation soldiers. The magazine reflects the "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense) trend that resurfaced after the war.
*   **Monetary Values:** The joke about 10 to 50 yen for a secret suggests the late 1940s or early 50s, when inflation was high but these amounts were still significant enough for a child's "extortion."
*   **Occupations:** Mentions of "Geisha," "O-joro" (courtesans), and "Dancers" reflect a society where the sex industry and entertainment districts (Akasen/Blue Line districts) were a major part of the urban landscape and social discourse.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The name "kasutori" refers to cheap shochu made from sake dregs. These magazines were intended to be "consumed and discarded," much like the cheap liquor. They were often scandalous, humorous, and slightly subversive.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **おあし (O-ashi):** Literally "feet," but also a traditional slang term for money (because it "runs away"). The pun here is that a shoemaker deals with feet.
*   **氣 (Ki):** Used in "秀山" (Shuzan/Bare mountain). The joke is "Ki ga nai," meaning both "no trees" (on the mountain) and "no interest/spirit" (in the person).
*   **パンパン (Pan-pan):** Post-WWII slang for prostitutes, particularly those who associated with GIs.
*   **御女郎 (O-joro):** A term for a prostitute/courtesan, sounding slightly archaic even for the 1950s, evoking the Edo/Meiji era.
*   **按摩 (Anma):** Traditional Japanese massage. The joke plays on the father's fear of infidelity (adultery) vs. the mundane reality of a professional service.
*   **妬（焼）いたり (Yaitari):** *Yaku* means to bake/grill (for rice cakes) but also means to be jealous.
*   **鮎 (Ayu / Ai):** A pun on the fish "Ayu" (sweetfish) and the word "Ai" (Love).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Cynicism and Misogyny:** Typical of the era's male-centric humor, women are categorized by their "utility" or compared to food. There is a clear distinction made between "wives" (plain tea/melting ice cream) and "professional women" (expensive fruit/fried tuna).
*   **Anxiety of Infidelity:** The "Massage" joke highlights a common social anxiety: the fear of a wife cheating while the husband is at work, reflecting changing domestic dynamics post-war.
*   **Escapism through Wordplay:** The heavy use of puns (kakekotoba) shows a playful engagement with the Japanese language, providing lighthearted entertainment during a period of national recovery.
*   **Class and Occupation:** The text categorizes people strictly by their jobs, reflecting a society still deeply rooted in occupational identities.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Humor Column, Riddles, Short Story (Joke), Satire.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Puns, Marriage, Gender Roles, Sexuality, Kasutori Culture, Adult Humor.
