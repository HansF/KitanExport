つくり藍（あざ）ができると思っておつたが、ガンテッ氏の来訪でオヂヤンだ。
「皮肉云（い）うなよ。ともかく、之（これ）を三木。之を下へ……」
「よしなッて事よ！総（すべ）ては無駄だ。笑い話……」
「笑い話だつて？……」
「オツサン！あの娘（むすめ）、三木の妹と見えるかい？」
「だつて……」

「大した妹だ。どこの世界に兄貴の糧（かて）を甞（な）む妹があるんだ。いけしやアしやアと娘面（むすめづら）していたが、奴（やつ）ア、五ヶ月なんだ。こうなつたら、何もかも白状するが、実（じつ）ア昨日、三木やおツ坊（ぼう）アの留守（るす）に、奴（やつ）にちょいと手を出したんだよ。奴（やつ）ア泣き喚（わめ）くし、そこへおツ母（かあ）アと、一足（いっそく）遅れてお鹿（しか）とが戻つてきたもんだから、大騒（おおさわ）ぎさ。暁（あかつき）になつて三木が帰ると、騒ぎは一層（いっそう）テンヤワンヤだ。九州人の一徹で、三木は口やかましく俺を非難しやがる。だが、元々、妹でもねえ者を、妹だなんて隠しておつたお前が悪いんだ。お前の罪だよ。と、云（い）つてやると、三木アしよげちまつた。
さア、出て行つてくれ！俺はもうお前に同情も何もじない。軒先（のきさき）貸して母屋（おもや）を取られた阿呆（あほう）は俺だ。さア、たった今どこへなりと行つて呉（く）れ！日頃のムカッ腹があつたもんだから、思う存分云（い）つてやつたんら。いや賑やかだつたぜ。三木の奴ア、守口（もりぐち）の知己（ちき）とかへ行くと云（い）つて、女房と婆（ばあ）さんを連れていつたが、それぎりなんだ。
あの、三木の野郎（やろう）が出て行く時の、泣きべそをかいたタカモリヅラは、思い出しただけでも可笑（おか）しかつたつヨ……。」
ハマノは近眼鏡（きんがんきょう）を光らしてふふゝと、笑つた。私には全てがあまりにもあ然とした事であつた。

五升（ごしょう）の米をハマノの分とし三升（さんしょう）の米をお鹿（しか）さんへと私はお鹿さんへ八升（はっしょう）の米を渡したのであるが、結局は、全部が彼女の貝貰（かいもら）いとなるのは判（わか）りきつていた。私とハマノは阪急（はんきゅう）へ遊び、それから地下街を暫（しばら）くウロゝしていたが、やがて阪急銀座へ出た。丁度（ちょうど）、梅田新道（うめだしんみち）の角で、ハマノは立どまると、
「ガンテッさん。実（じつ）ア僕、ちよつと用事を思い出したんだうん。遠くへ行かなくちやならないのだ。遅くとも戻るには戻るが。まあそこいらで昼飯でもたべよう。」
私達二人は、中華料理で店妙飯（チャアハン）と蟹玉子（ハイタア）をたべると、右と左に別れた。
ガラリと格子（こうし）を開けて入るとお鹿さんが台所の叩（たた）きの上に洗面器（せんめんき）を置いて髪を洗つていた。白い豊満（ほうまん）な上半身（じょうはんしん）で、脇の下に丸つこ大きな乳房（ちち）がくつついてる。私は、それを横目（よこめ）でチラリと見て階段をあがる。
私はハマノの部屋で、旅の疲れからグッスリ寝込んでしまった。マダムがお茶を持ってきてくれたつたのも、知らなかつた。
下（した）へ下りて行つて詫（わ）びを云（い）い、顔を洗つてやつと人心心地（ひとここち）ついた所で、失礼しようなと思つているとマダムが、
「何も御座（ござ）いませんけどお夕飯たべて頂けませんか？」
首を傾（かし）げて、媚（こ）びるような目付（めつき）をしたので、私はマダムの向い膳（ぜん）に、へたへたと腰を落着（おちつ）けてしまつた。
菜（さい）は、揚豆腐（あげどうふ）の刻み入りのきゅうり揉（も）みと、鰯（いわし）の塩焼（しおやき）。マダムは、ピーナツの小皿に入れにたのを、私の方へ押しやる、とコップへごぼゝゝとショウチュウをついだ。
「いや。之（これ）はやれません。私はごく弱いんでして……」
「でも、おまけすればお飲みしますわ。」
彼女は袋から砂糖（さとう）を幾匙（いくさじ）かコップの中へ入れ、よく掻き廻（まわ）した。
私は既に酩酊（めいてい）して、何もかもが、くるゝゝ廻つてるような感じがした。もう船に還（かえ）つたってかまわねえ。今夜はこの家へ泊るんだ。何て素晴らしい夜なんだ！
私は傍（かたわ）らのマダムを見た。マダムは白い胸を出して乳児に乳を飮（の）ませていた。私はその空いている方の乳房をつかもうとして、腰を浮（う）かした。マダムはホッホッホと笑いながらかるく身をよぢる。
途端（とたん）に、彼女は大きな満月のような白いお尻を見せて、寝返りをうつと、ブスッウ……と云（い）うにぶい生理的の音をさせた。そして、不運な私は、此の意外に強い異臭（いしゅう）の為（ため）に、マダムを征服する勇気を失つてしまったのである。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Thinking that a fake bruise could be made, but with Mr. Gantei's visit, it's a washout (ojyan).
"Don't be ironic. Anyway, this to Miki. This to downstairs..."
"Stop it! Everything is useless. A funny story..."
"A funny story, you say?..."
"Old man! That girl, does she look like Miki's younger sister to you?"
"But..."

"A great sister indeed. In what world is there a sister who eats her older brother's food rations? She was acting shamelessly like a young daughter, but she (yatsu) is five months [pregnant]. Since it's come to this, I'll confess everything: actually, yesterday, while Miki and Otsubo were out, I laid a hand on her. She wailed, and then Mother and Oshika returned a step late, so it was a big commotion. When Miki returned at dawn, the commotion became even more chaotic (tenya-wanya). With the stubbornness of a Kyushu person, Miki kept grumbling and blaming me. But, I said, you are the one at fault for hiding someone who wasn't your sister and calling her a sister. It's your sin. When I told him that, Miki became dejected.
Now, get out! I have no sympathy for you anymore. I am the fool who lent the eaves and had the main house taken. Now, go wherever right this moment! Since I had a long-standing resentment, I told him off to my heart's content. Man, it was lively. Miki's fellow said he was going to an acquaintance in Moriguchi and took his wife and the old woman, but that was the end of it.
That Takamori-face (Saigo Takamori-like face) he made when he left, crying like a baby—just remembering it was hilarious..."
Hamano laughed "fufu" with his near-sighted glasses glinting. To me, the whole thing was something to be utterly stunned by.

**IV**

Giving five sho of rice as Hamano’s share and three sho of rice for Oshika-san, I handed eight sho of rice to Oshika-san, but in the end, it was clear that all of it would end up as her "shell-gathering" (taking it all). Hamano and I played at Hankyu, then wandered the underground mall for a while, eventually coming out at Hankyu Ginza. Right at the corner of Umeda Shindo, Hamano stopped.
"Gantei-san. Actually, I just remembered an errand. I have to go far away. I'll return eventually, though. Well, let's have lunch around here."
The two of us ate fried rice (chahan) and crab-egg (haitaa) at a Chinese restaurant, then split left and right.
When I opened the lattice door with a clatter and entered, Oshika-san was washing her hair with a basin on the kitchen floor. With a white, voluptuous upper body, round large breasts were attached under her armpits. I caught a glimpse of them out of the corner of my eye and went up the stairs.
In Hamano’s room, I fell fast asleep due to the exhaustion of the journey. I didn't even know that the Madame had brought tea.
I went downstairs to apologize, washed my face, and just as I was feeling like myself again and thinking of leaving, the Madame said,
"We have nothing much, but won't you eat dinner?"
She tilted her head and gave a flirtatious look, so I slumped down at the table opposite her.
The side dishes were cucumber salad with chopped fried tofu and grilled salted sardines. The Madame pushed a small plate of peanuts toward me and poured shochu into a glass with a "gobo-gobo" sound.
"No, I can't drink this. I'm quite weak with alcohol..."
"But, if I make it sweet, you will drink it."
She put several spoonfuls of sugar from a bag into the glass and stirred it well.
I was already intoxicated, and it felt as if everything was spinning around. I don't care if I don't go back to the ship anymore. I'll stay at this house tonight. What a wonderful night!
I looked at the Madame beside me. The Madame had her white chest out and was nursing an infant. I tried to grab the other, free breast and lifted my hips. The Madame laughed "ho-ho-ho" and lightly twisted her body.
At that moment, she showed her white buttocks like a big full moon, turned over, and made a dull, physiological sound—"busu"... And I, the unlucky one, lost the courage to conquer the Madame because of this unexpectedly strong offensive odor.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

I had expected some physical altercation to break out, but Mr. Gantei’s sudden arrival brought everything to a grinding halt.
"Don't be so cynical," someone said. "Anyway, take this to Miki. Take it downstairs..."
"Forget it! It's all a waste. Just a joke..."
"A joke, you say?"
"Look, old man! Does that girl look like Miki’s sister to you?"
"Well..."

"Some sister she is! Where in the world does a sister gobble up her own brother's food rations? She went around with that innocent look on her face, but the truth is, the girl is five months pregnant. Since it’s come to this, I’ll come clean. Yesterday, while Miki and the boy were out, I made a move on her. She started wailing, and just then the mother and Oshika came back, creating a total scene. When Miki finally got back at dawn, things went completely haywire. With that stubborn Kyushu pride of his, Miki started barking at me. But I told him, 'It's your own fault for hiding a woman who isn't even your sister and lying about it! This is on you!' That took the wind out of his sails."
"Now, get out! I’m done being sympathetic. I’m the idiot who let you in only to have you try and take over. Get out of here right now, go wherever you like!" I let him have it, venting all the pent-up frustration I'd been harboring. It was quite a spectacle. Miki said he was going to see an acquaintance in Moriguchi and left with his wife and the old woman, and that was that.
"Man, you should have seen the look on Miki’s face when he left—blubbering like a baby with that big Saigo Takamori mug of his. I still laugh just thinking about it..."
Hamano’s glasses glinted as he chuckled. I just stood there, completely dumbfounded by the whole ordeal.

**IV**

I had handed over eight *sho* of rice to Oshika-san—five for Hamano and three for her—though I knew perfectly well she’d end up pocketing the whole lot. Hamano and I killed some time at the Hankyu department store and wandered through the underground shopping malls before emerging at the Hankyu Ginza. At the corner of Umeda Shindo, Hamano stopped short.
"Gantei-san, I just remembered something I have to take care of. It’s a bit of a trek. I’ll be back eventually, but why don’t you grab some lunch around here?"
We went into a Chinese joint, shared some fried rice and crab omelet, and then went our separate ways.
When I rattled open the lattice door of the house, I found Oshika-san in the kitchen, washing her hair over a basin. Her pale, voluptuous upper body was exposed, and I caught a glimpse of her large, rounded breasts tucked under her arms. I stole a quick look and headed upstairs.
Worn out from the trip, I collapsed in Hamano’s room and fell into a deep sleep. I didn't even notice when the Madame brought me tea.
When I finally went downstairs to apologize and wash my face, I was starting to feel human again. I was about to see myself out when the Madame spoke up.
"It’s not much, but would you care to stay for dinner?"
She tilted her head with a flirtatious glint in her eyes, and before I knew it, I had slumped down at the table across from her.
The meal consisted of cucumber salad with fried tofu and grilled sardines. She pushed a small dish of peanuts toward me and poured a generous glass of shochu.
"Oh, I really shouldn't. I’m a bit of a lightweight..."
"Oh, come now. I'll make it sweet for you; you'll like it then."
She spooned several heaps of sugar into the glass and stirred it vigorously.
Before long, I was properly tipsy. The room was starting to spin. *To hell with catching the ship,* I thought. *I’m staying here tonight. What a glorious night!*
I looked over at the Madame. She had her blouse open, nursing her baby at her white breast. I reached out, half-rising from my seat to cup the other, free breast. She let out a playful "ho-ho-ho" and twisted away slightly.
In that instant, she turned, exposing her pale backside—round and white as a full moon—and then let out a blunt, unceremonious "pfft." The sudden, pungent odor was enough to instantly dampen my spirits. My courage to "conquer" the Madame vanished into thin air.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Format:** This is a page from a literary or "kasutori" magazine. It features a narrative story divided into numbered sections (this page shows the transition into section IV).
*   **Typography:** Vertical text layout (tategaki) is used, which is standard for Japanese literature. The title "スープッ" (Soup) is integrated into the illustration in a stylized, bold katakana font.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration serves as the centerpiece, separating the dialogue-heavy top section from the narrative-heavy bottom section. The illustration depicts a man (presumably "Gantei" or the narrator) eating, and a woman (the Madame) in a state of partial undress, hinting at the story's erotic undertones.
*   **Columns:** The text is organized in columns that flow from right to left. Line breaks are used for dialogue, while prose is dense.
*   **Annotation:** Furigana (reading aids) are used for difficult kanji (e.g., 甞む for *namu*, 叩き for *tataki*) and names (三木 for *Miki*), typical of popular magazines intended for a general audience.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era:** Post-WWII Japan (late 1940s). This is evidenced by the mention of rice rations (*sho* measurements) and locations like "Hankyu Ginza" and "Umeda Shindo" in Osaka.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term "Kasutori" refers to cheap, pulpy magazines that flourished after the war. They were known for a mix of "ero-guro-nansen-su" (eroticism, grotesquery, and nonsense). This story, with its focus on food, drinking, and a failed sexual encounter ending in a fart, is a textbook example.
*   **Rice Rations:** The mention of "five sho" and "eight sho" (approximately 1.8 liters per sho) highlights the food scarcity of the era. Rice was a precious commodity, often traded on the black market or strictly managed.
*   **Western Influence:** The title "Soup" and the mention of "Madame" (common for the proprietress of a bar or boarding house) show the post-war influx of Western loanwords and social archetypes.
*   **Shochu with Sugar:** Drinking shochu sweetened with sugar was a common way to mask the harsh taste of low-quality, bootleg alcohol (also called *kasutori* shochu) prevalent at the time.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **オヂヤン (Ojyan):** Slang for something coming to naught or being "ruined/canceled." Still used occasionally today.
*   **いけしゃあしゃあと (Ikeshaashaato):** An adverb describing someone acting shamelessly or with "brazen impudence."
*   **テンヤワンヤ (Tenya-wanya):** Onomatopoeia for a chaotic, hectic, or bustling situation.
*   **タカモリヅラ (Takamori-zura):** "Saigo Takamori face." Referring to the famous 19th-century samurai known for his large, round, somewhat tragic face.
*   **貝貰い (Kaimorai):** Likely a regionalism or period slang for "taking everything" or "scooping it up," possibly related to "shell-gathering" where one takes what they find.
*   **人心地 (Hitokokochi):** The feeling of being oneself again, or feeling alive/relieved after a period of stress.
*   **向い膳 (Mukaizen):** Sitting directly opposite someone at a meal table.
*   **ブスッウ (Busuu):** An onomatopoeic representation of a flatulent sound, specifically a "muffled" or "wet" one.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **The Grittiness of Post-War Life:** The story captures the messy reality of shared housing, domestic disputes, and the constant preoccupation with food and alcohol.
*   **Sexual Frustration and Bathos:** The narrative builds toward a sexual conquest (the "conquering" of the Madame), only to be undercut by a crude biological reality (the fart). This "anti-climax" or *bathos* is a common comedic device in Japanese "low" literature.
*   **Deception:** A recurring theme in the first half is people pretending to be who they aren't (the "sister" who isn't a sister). This reflects the social upheaval where people took in strangers or lied about family to secure rations or housing.
*   **Masculinity in Crisis:** The narrator's attempt to exert dominance is easily thwarted by his own low alcohol tolerance and a bad smell, painting a picture of the "dandy" who is ultimately pathetic.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Kasutori Literature.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Eroticism (soft), Humour, Satire, Food/Rationing, Domestic Drama.
