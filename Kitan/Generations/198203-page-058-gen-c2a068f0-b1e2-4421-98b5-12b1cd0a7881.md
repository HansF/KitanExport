**Body Text:**
土方作業をやるようになって、僕の人相はすっかり変ってしまった。
鏡の前に立つと、眼だけがギョロリと白く光り、ひげだらけの顔は山男か船頭のように渋色に化し、胸も股も異様に骨ばってきた。

日が暮れるとへとへとになって戻った。みつ子はいいそいそと四つ辻のところにきて迎えてくれた。
いつも湯上がりだった。僕が垢と土でどろんこになって、腹がけにわずかな出づら（日給）をチャラつかせて帰ってくるまでに、みつ子は銭湯へ行って念入りにお化粧をし、眼がさめるような和服に、エプロンをかけて出迎えるのだった。

そして、僕の日にやけて、埃と泥で毛穴まで垢黒くなった手や、汗が乾いて白い粉がふいている腕を、ふっくらとした柔らかな指でおそるおそるさわりながら「お疲れでしたでしょう……とってもおいしいもの買ってある

**Header:**
SM Secret Literature Exploration
**Title:**
Tales of Bedchamber Pleasure (*Keibō Etsuraku Tan*)

**Introductory Note:**
This volume is a masterpiece from the secret library of Mr. R, who was active as a standard-bearer of the New Sensationalist School (*Shinkankaku-ha*) in the early Showa period. It is a work that digs down into the dark parts of human sentiment to complete an authentic erotic novel. The passion lurking behind the gorgeous literary style, and the obsession with repeatedly taking up the shameful parts of human nature, are transmitted to the reader's skin.

**Sub-header:**
The Innocent Coquetry of the New Wife

**Body Text:**
Since I started doing navvy work [earthworks/day labor], my physiognomy has completely changed.
When I stand before the mirror, only my eyes shine gogglingly white; my beard-covered face has transformed into an astringent color like a mountain man or a boatman, and both my chest and thighs have become strangely bony.

When the sun set, I returned exhausted. Mitsuko came excitedly to the crossroads to welcome me.
She was always fresh from the bath. By the time I returned, covered in grime and earth, jingling my meager day-wages (*dezura*) in my *haragake* apron, Mitsuko would have gone to the public bathhouse, carefully applied her makeup, and would come out to greet me wearing an eye-openingly beautiful kimono with an apron over it.

And then, while timidly touching my sunburnt hands—which had become grime-black down to the pores with dust and mud—and my arms, where dried sweat had bloomed into white powder, with her plump, soft fingers, [she would say], "You must be tired... I have bought something very delicious..."

Explorations in Secret SM Literature
**Title:**
Chronicles of Boudoir Ecstasy

**Introductory Note:**
This piece is a masterwork from the secret collection of "Mr. R," a celebrated figure of the New Sensationalist movement in the early Showa era. It delves into the darkest recesses of the human heart to forge a truly authentic erotic novel. The passion concealed beneath his ornate prose, and his obsession with exposing the shameful underbelly of human nature, are palpable enough to make the reader's skin crawl.

**Sub-header:**
The Innocent Allure of a New Wife

**Body Text:**
Ever since I began working as a navvy, my appearance has utterly transformed.
When I stand before a mirror, only my eyes gleam white and bulging; my bearded face has weathered to the astringent hue of a mountain hermit or a boatman, and my chest and thighs have grown grotesquely angular and bony.

I would return at sunset, exhausted. Mitsuko would rush eagerly to the crossroads to meet me.
She was always fresh from the bath. While I was out getting covered in grime and soil, only to come home jingling a pittance of day-wages in my workman's apron, Mitsuko would have visited the bathhouse, applied her makeup with great care, and come out to greet me in a dazzling kimono covered by a domestic apron.

Then, with her soft, plump fingers, she would timidly touch my sunburnt hands—blackened with dust and mud down to the pores—and my arms, dusted white with dried sweat. "You must be so tired," she would say. "I've bought something very delicious for you..."

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** "Secret Literature" Feature (SM秘密文学探求). This section serves to legitimize erotica by framing it as "lost literature" or "high art" from a previous era (Early Showa).
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person ("Boku"). The narrator occupies a masochistic socio-economic position (fallen intellectual turned laborer), contrasting with the idealized, pristine wife.
*   **Authorial Persona:** "Mr. R" (R-shi). This is a heavy-handed allusion. In the context of Japanese mystery and deviant literature (*ero-guro*), "R" usually signals **Ranpo Edogawa**. However, describing him as a flagbearer of the "New Sensationalist School" (*Shinkankaku-ha*)—which usually refers to Yokomitsu Riichi or Kawabata Yasunari—is a literary conflation typical of pulp magazines trying to sound academic. It implies a high-literary pedigree for the smut.
*   **Visual-Text Dissonance:** The text describes a tender, domestic scene (albeit with class anxiety). The accompanying illustration (a bound woman and a masked observer) suggests the "delicious thing" or the night's activities will involve sadomasochistic rituals, contextualizing the "innocent" text as a prelude to perversion.

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Navvy / Doyou (土方):** Day laborers involved in construction and earthmoving. In post-war Japan, this was often the resort of men who had lost their status or employment due to the war. The term carries a stigma of being rough, low-class, and physically exhausting.
*   **Haragake (腹掛け):** A traditional Japanese workman's apron/plastron, covering the chest and stomach, often with a pouch for money. It is a visual marker of the working class (shokunin/laborer).
*   **Sentō (銭湯 - Public Bath):** In the mid-20th century, few private homes had baths. The wife's trip to the bathhouse is a ritual of purification. Her being "fresh from the bath" while he is "covered in mud" creates a stark hygiene/class contrast central to the fetish.
*   **New Sensationalist School (Shinkankaku-ha):** A modernist literary movement of the 1920s that emphasized subjective perception and sensory immediacy. Citing this movement elevates the "smut" to "art."

---

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Keibō (閨房):** "Bedchamber." An archaic, slightly pedantic term often used in erotica to lend a sense of elegance or timelessness to sex.
*   **Dezura (出づら):** A colloquialism for daily wages (literally "appearance [pay]"). It emphasizes the precarious nature of his work—he is paid only when he shows up.
*   **Shibuiro (渋色):** "Astringent color." Usually refers to the color of persimmon tannin (brownish-red). Here it denotes a deep, weathered tan, associating the narrator with outdoor, primitive labor.
*   **Chibu (恥部):** "Shameful parts" or "Private parts." Used metaphorically in the intro for "human nature's dark side," but inevitably carries genital connotations in this genre.

## Themes & Subtext

*   **The Beauty and the Beast:** The core dynamic is the juxtaposition of the "grime-blackened," "bony," "animalistic" husband against the "soft," "plump," "powdered," and "fragrant" wife.
*   **Class Degradation as Fetish:** The narrator seems to revel in his transformation from a regular man into a "mountain man" or laborer. The text dwells on the dirt in his pores and the salt on his skin.
*   **Domestic Horror/Bliss:** The scene is outwardly idyllic (devoted wife greeting husband), but the editorial framing ("dark parts of human mind," "SM exploration") suggests this domesticity is a façade or a prelude to a ritualized sexual scenario (likely involving the bondage shown in the image).
*   **Tactile Eroticism:** The text focuses heavily on texture—mud, dry sweat, soft fingers, bone, white powder. This aligns with the "New Sensationalist" claim of focusing on sensory perception.

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Genre:** Erotic Fiction, Ero-Guro, Pulp Literature.
*   **Themes:** Blue-collar fetish, Hygiene contrast, Domestic roleplay, Hidden perversion.
*   **Sexual Content:** Implied (in text), Explicit (in adjacent illustration - Bondage/Kinbaku).
