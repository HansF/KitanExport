## 1️⃣ Original Japanese
けの道を、彼は時子に支えられて歩いていた。
「大丈夫？ 隨分酔つているのね」
「うん、一人で帰れるよ」
「そう、では、氣をつけてね。妾此所（ここ）で別れるわ」

**二**
「あなた、あなた」
どこか遠くで呼んでいる様だ。はれぼつたい瞼を無理に開けたが、意識がはつきりせず頭がづき〜と痛む。
「あなた、出勤の時間ですよ。お起きにならないの？」
朝の光線がまぶしく目を打つ。
「頭が痛いから、休むよ」
そのまゝ彼は再び深い眠りに陥つた。時計が十時を打つてから、やつと目が覚めた。そして、おぼろげながら昨夜の事を考えた。
そうだ彼女と今日、有楽町駅前の喫茶店で待合わせ約束があつたつけ。春雄はそう思い出してダルい身体を起した。
「あら、お起きになるの、昨日の晩はあんなに酔つぱらつてしまつて、お隣りの息子さんが、途中であなたを見つけて送つて下さつたのよ」
妻の良子から昨夜の醜態を聞きながら、朝食とも晝食ともつかぬチグハグな食事をすました。
「良子、用事を思い出したから、出かける。服を出してくれ」
良子は昨夜着ていた服をきちんと畳んだまゝで持つて来た。内ポケットを探つて、あつと顔を蒼くした。

「良子、内ポケットに入つていた金は仕舞つたか？」
彼は昨日の中に集金した約三万円の金をそこへ入れていたのだ。
「いゝえ、知りませんわ」
無い、無い、懐中時計もないのだ。誰が盗つたのか、落した筈はない。内ポケットはちゃんと鋲がかけてあつたし、時計には鎖がつていたのだ。
隣りの息子もわざ〜自分を送つてくれる位だから、まさか、──そんな事はある筈がない。
最も怪しいのは、自分は全然覚えのない時子とかいう、あの女だ。若しもあの女が盗んだものなら、約束の處には待つていまい、何處かで自分をあざ笑つているだろう。
春雄はいろゝそんな事を考えながら、道を急いだ。都電を下りるなり、駅前の喫茶店へと飛び込んだ。いない、彼女に似た影もない。
やりやがつた、やつぱり彼女なのだ。然し約束の時間には、まだ少し間がある。ので待つ事にしてコーヒーを頼んだ。いら〜する心を押えて待つていたが、遂に時子は姿を見せなかつた。
春雄は二日酔いに、かてゝ加えて憂鬱な重い氣持で駅へ引き返した。街の賑やかさも今日は腹立たしく、情なかつた。

一昨日、集金に赴いて、酒でゴマ化されて貰えなかつた店を訪ねて、残りの金を貰うともう二度と、あのような失敗はしないぞと、眞直ぐに家路へと

スリ取つた金品は、平場師の場合同様、素早くリレー式に次々と仲間に渡してしまい、カミソリの刃は床へとつそり捨てゝしまうから、ハッと氣がついて「スリだつ！」とさわいだ時にはもうおそい。たしかにこいつがスリだと思つても、何の証拠もないので、泣き寝入りになるのが落ちである。

**4 どんな人が狙いやすいか**
スリの喜ぶホシは、田舎から出てきた人、家庭のおかみさん、サラリーマンの順で、実に容易にスレるそうである。面白いことには制服の警官が同乗している場合の方が、乗客はスリに対して安心していゝからかえつてその油断に乗じて スリやすいと云う話である。

が、ぽつりと現金で膨れたような鞄を持っているホシ（ターゲット）を見つけると、手で軽く鞄をつついてその重みを試す。

（熟練したスリならその重みで、大体何万円くらいを持っているかすぐに見当がつくと云う）確かに金目の物が入っていると知ると、同乗している他の一人はもっぱら助手役となり、ホシの注意をそらす。（例えば新聞をホシの眼の前に広げて視界を遮ったり、わざと横腹や、背中をぐいぐい押したり、鞄から注意が去った間一髪、三人目のスリが、安全カミソリの刃で、鞄の底皮（または背皮）をスッと切る。そして、切れ目から顔を出す札束を瞬間抜き取ってしまう。

スリ取った金品は、平場師（ひらばし）の場合同様、素早くリレー式に次々と仲間に渡してしまい、カミソリの刃は床へこっそり捨ててしまうから、ハッと気がついて「スリだ！」と騒いだ時にはもう遅い。確かにこいつがスリだと思っても、何の証拠もないので、泣き寝入りになるのがオチである。

**4 どんな人が狙いやすいか**
スリの喜ぶホシは、田舎から出てきた人、家庭のおかみさん、サラリーマンの順で、実に容易にスレる（盗れる）そうである。面白いことには制服の警官が同乗している場合の方が、乗客はスリに対して安心していられるから、かえってその油断に乗じてスリやすいという話である。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
(Ending of a sentence)... road, he by Tokiko being supported was walking.
"Are you okay? Quite drunk you are, aren't you."
"Yeah, alone can go home."
"I see, then, care take please. I here at will part ways."

**2**
"Dear, dear."
Somewhere far away calling seems to be. Swollen eyelids forced open but, consciousness clear not and head throbbing aches.
"Dear, commute time it is. Getting up not?"
Morning light rays dazzlingly eyes hit.
"Head aches because, rest I will."
As it is he again deep sleep fell into. Clock ten struck after, finally eyes opened. And, vaguely last night's things thought about.
That's right, her and today, Yurakucho station-front coffee shop at meeting promise there was, I recall. Haruo that remembered and sluggish body raised.
"Oh, getting up are you. Last night's evening so drunk became, neighbor's son, on the way you found and sent (brought) home for us."
Wife Ryoko from last night's shameful sight hearing while, breakfast nor lunch neither-nor inconsistent meal finished.
"Ryoko, business remembered because, going out. Clothes bring out please."
Ryoko last night wearing was clothes neatly folded as were brought. Inside pocket searched, "ah" and face turned pale.

"Ryoko, inside pocket in was money put away did you?"
He yesterday during collected approximately 30,000 yen money there put had.
"No, know not I."
None, none, pocket watch also none is. Who stole, dropped chance none. Inside pocket properly stud (fastener) set was, and watch to chain attached was.
Neighbor's son even purposely self brought home degree because, no way, -- such a thing happen chance none is.
Most suspicious is, self at all memory none Tokiko called, that woman is. If that woman stole thing if, promised place at wait will not, somewhere self mocking will be.
Haruo various such things thinking while, road hurried. Toden (streetcar) getting off immediately, station-front coffee shop into dove. Not there, her resembling shadow even none.
Did it (stole it), as expected her it is. However promised time to, still a little time is. So wait thing decided and coffee ordered. Irritated heart suppressing was waiting but, finally Tokiko appearance showed not.
Haruo hangover to, added to that gloomy heavy feeling with station to returned. City's liveliness also today irritating, pathetic was.

**3**
The day before yesterday, collection went to, alcohol by deceived not received shop visited, remaining money receive then already second time, such mistake do not will, straight home road to...

*(Bottom text explanation)*
But, plop with cash bulging-like bag holding "hoshi" (target) finds when, hand with lightly bag poking its weight tests.

(Skilled pickpocket if that weight by, roughly how many ten-thousand yen holding immediately estimate attached says) Certainly valuable thing entered know when, riding along other one person exclusively assistant role becomes, hoshi's attention diverts. (For example newspaper hoshi's eyes in front of spreading visibility blocks, or purposely side or, back push-push, bag from attention left hair's breadth, third person pickpocket, safety razor blade with, bag's bottom leather (or back leather) "swish" cuts. And, from slit head showing bill roll instant pull out away.

Pickpocketed goods, "hirabashi" (street thief) case same, quickly relay-style one after another to accomplices hands over, razor blade floor to stealthily discards because, "Ha!" noticed "Pickpocket!" shouted time at already late. Certainly this guy pickpocket is think even, what evidence none because, crying-sleeping (giving up) becomes end is.

**4 What kind of person easy to aim?**
Pickpocket's liking "hoshi" are, countryside from come people, household wives, salarymen in order, indeed easily "rubbed" (picked) seems. Interesting thing to is uniformed police riding along case way, passengers pickpocket toward relieved can be because instead that negligence taking advantage of easy to pick says story is.

Pickpocket by not done in order to special bag holding way is because teach will. One hand with dangling carrying is most dangerous.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
He walked along the path, leaning on Tokiko for support.
"Are you all right? You're quite drunk, aren't you?"
"Yeah... I can make it home on my own."
"I see. Well, take care then. I’ll leave you here."

**II**
"Honey, honey!"
A voice seemed to be calling from far away. He forced his swollen eyelids open, but his mind was foggy and his head throbbed with a dull ache.
"Honey, it's time for work. Aren't you going to get up?"
The morning light struck his eyes with a dazzling glare.
"My head hurts... I’m staying home."
With that, he drifted back into a deep sleep. It wasn't until the clock struck ten that he finally woke up. Vaguely, he began to piece together the events of the previous night.
That’s right—he had a promise to meet that woman today at the coffee shop in front of Yurakucho Station. Haruo remembered and dragged his sluggish body out of bed.
"Oh, you’re finally up? You were so drunk last night; the neighbor's son found you on his way and brought you home."
While listening to his wife, Ryoko, recount his shameful behavior, he finished a haphazard meal that was neither breakfast nor lunch.
"Ryoko, I just remembered I have an errand. I’m going out. Get my clothes ready."
Ryoko brought the clothes he had worn the night before, still neatly folded. But as he searched the inner pocket, his face suddenly went pale.

"Ryoko, did you put away the money that was in the inner pocket?"
He had put about 30,000 yen—money he had collected just yesterday—into that very pocket.
"No, I haven't seen it."
It was gone. Gone, and his pocket watch was missing too. Someone must have stolen them; there was no way he had simply dropped them. The inner pocket had been securely fastened with a snap, and the watch had been on a chain.
The neighbor’s son had gone out of his way to bring him home, so surely it couldn't be him... no, that was impossible.
The most suspicious one was that woman, Tokiko—someone he barely knew. If she had stolen it, she wouldn't be waiting at the meeting spot; she was probably somewhere laughing at him right now.
Haruo hurried along, his mind racing with these thoughts. As soon as he got off the streetcar, he dashed into the coffee shop in front of the station. She wasn't there. There wasn't even a shadow of anyone who looked like her.
"She did it. It was her after all." Yet, there was still a little time before their scheduled meeting. He decided to wait and ordered a coffee. He sat there, suppressing his growing irritation, but in the end, Tokiko never showed her face.
Coupled with his hangover, Haruo headed back to the station with a heavy, gloomy heart. The bustling crowds of the city only served to irritate him today; he felt utterly pathetic.

**III**
The day before yesterday, he had gone to make collections. He visited the shops that had tried to dodge payment by getting him drunk, and as he collected the remaining cash, he vowed to himself that he would never make such a mistake again. He headed straight home...

*(Educational Segment)*
...But when a pickpocket finds a "hoshi" (target) carrying a bag that looks plump with cash, they lightly tap the bag to test its weight.

(It is said that a veteran pickpocket can tell almost exactly how many tens of thousands of yen someone is carrying just by that weight.) Once they are certain there is something valuable inside, one of the accomplices focuses solely on distracting the target. For instance, they might spread a newspaper in front of the target's face to block their vision, or repeatedly jostle them from the side or back. In the split second the target's attention is diverted from their bag, a third pickpocket uses a safety razor to swiftly slice through the bottom or side leather. They then instantly snatch the roll of bills as it slides out of the slit.

Stolen goods are quickly passed from one accomplice to another in a relay fashion—much like the "hirabashi" (street thieves) do. Since the razor blade is surreptitiously dropped to the floor, by the time the victim realizes and shouts "Pickpocket!", it’s already too late. Even if you are certain who did it, there is no evidence, and you are usually forced to just give up and accept the loss.

**4. Who is an easy target?**
The targets pickpockets love most are, in order: people from the countryside, housewives, and salarymen. It is said they are very easy to "rub" (pick). Interestingly, when a uniformed police officer is on board, passengers tend to feel safer and let their guard down, which actually makes it easier for pickpockets to take advantage of that negligence.

To avoid being victimized, there are specific ways to hold your bag that I will teach you. Carrying it dangling from one hand is the most dangerous way.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout & Structure:** The page is divided into two distinct parts: a narrative fiction (top and middle) and an instructional/editorial column (bottom). This "infotainment" style was common in mid-century Japanese magazines.
*   **Typography:** The text is set in traditional vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). Headings use Roman numerals (II, III) and Arabic numerals (4) to denote sections.
*   **Visual Elements:** A central illustration depicts a hand using a razor to cut into a bag—a visual "how-to" of the crime being described.
*   **Columns:** The narrative flows across several columns. The instructional text at the bottom is separated by a decorative border, indicating a change in tone from story to factual reportage.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "48" is visible at the bottom right.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era:** This text likely dates to the **1950s**. The mention of **30,000 yen** is a key indicator; in the early-to-mid 1950s, this was a substantial sum (roughly equivalent to 1-2 months' salary for a regular worker).
*   **Urban Life:** References to **Yurakucho Station** and the **Toden** (Tokyo Metropolitan Streetcar) place the setting in the heart of Tokyo's post-war recovery era.
*   **Social Morality:** The story warns against the dangers of "collection culture" (door-to-door payment collection) and the social pitfalls of excessive drinking (*nomi-nication*), which often led to being targeted by criminals.
*   **Gender Roles:** The wife (Ryoko) is depicted in a traditional supportive role, waking her husband, preparing meals, and maintaining his clothes, while the "temptress" (Tokiko) represents the perceived dangers of the urban underworld.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **妾 (Watashi/Atashi):** In pre-war and early post-war literature, this kanji was often used for the female first-person pronoun. While it can mean "concubine," here it is a stylistic choice for a feminine "I."
*   **ホシ (Hoshi):** Police and criminal slang for a target or a suspect. Derived from *hoshi* (star/mark).
*   **平場師 (Hirabashi):** A specific term for pickpockets who operate in open spaces like markets or festivals, as opposed to those on trains.
*   **安全カミソリ (Anzen Kamisori):** Safety razor. In this era, these were common tools for pickpockets to slit leather bags.
*   **泣き寝入り (Naki-ne-iri):** An idiom meaning to "cry oneself to sleep" or, more accurately, to be forced to accept a grievance or loss without redress.
*   **スレる (Sureru):** Usually means "to become sophisticated/jaded," but here it is used as a pun or technical term for being "rubbed" or "picked" (from *suru* - to pick a pocket).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **The Danger of Negligence:** The central theme is *yudan* (negligence/carelessness). Haruo's drunkenness and his false sense of security (thinking the neighbor's son or the presence of police would keep him safe) are presented as moral failings that lead to his loss.
*   **Urban Cynicism:** The city is portrayed as a place of deception. Even a casual meeting at a coffee shop is a setup for a crime.
*   **Education as Protection:** The shift from a cautionary tale to a technical explanation suggests a "survival guide" mentality for the post-war citizen.
*   **Class & Vulnerability:** The hierarchy of targets (Country folk > Housewives > Salarymen) reflects social perceptions of who was "naive" enough to be robbed in the big city.
