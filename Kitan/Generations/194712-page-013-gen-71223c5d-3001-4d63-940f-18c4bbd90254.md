**26**

私は此の女体の美しさに陶酔し、飽くことを知らぬ快感の中に身を

委ねる。彼女は夫を戦地に送つた後、寂しさのあまり私と関係し

たのだ。その関係は二年前の夏の夜、彼女の寝室で始まりました。

彼女は初め、私の求愛を拒んだ。それも厳しく。私は彼女の貞操観

念が如何に強いものかを知つた。が、私はそれを打ち破ることに、

無上の興奮を覚えたのだ。

やがて彼女は身も心も私に捧げた。その夜、私は彼女の白い肌に

刻まれた、無数の紅い鞭痕を見た。私は驚いて尋ねると、彼女は顔

を赤らめて、「これは、前の晩の、夫の愛の証です」と囁き、泣い

た。私はその涙の意味を理解出来た。彼女は所謂る従順なる妻だ。

その後の私たちの行為は、更に異常な情熱を帯びた。私は彼女を、

夫以上の方法で愛し、そして罰した。

（東京市　宮本誠一 氏・会社員・三六才）

## Literal English Translation

**26**

I was intoxicated by the beauty of this female body, and surrendered

myself to a pleasure that knew no satiety. She, after sending her husband

off to the battlefield, related with me out of loneliness. That relationship

began two years ago on a summer night, in her bedroom.

At first, she refused my courtship. And strictly so. I came to know

how strong her concept of chastity was. But, I felt a supreme

excitement in breaking it down.

Eventually, she devoted both her body and soul to me. That night,

I saw countless red whip marks engraved upon her white skin. When I

asked, surprised, she blushed and whispered, "These are proof of

my husband's love, from the night before," and cried. I was able to

understand the meaning of those tears. She is a so-called obedient wife.

Our subsequent acts took on an even more abnormal passion. I loved

and punished her using methods exceeding those of her husband.

(Tokyo City, Mr. Miyamoto Seiichi, Company Employee, Age 36)

## Literary English Translation

**26**

I became utterly intoxicated by the beauty of this woman's flesh, surrendering

myself completely to an insatiable pleasure. She sought a relationship with me

out of sheer loneliness, her husband having been sent away to the front. Our affair

began two years ago, one summer night, in her own bedroom.

She initially resisted my advances, and fiercely so. I learned firsthand how rigid

her notions of fidelity were. But I found a supreme excitement in shattering that

resistance.

Before long, she devoted both her body and her soul to me. That night, I discovered

innumerable crimson whip marks etched onto her white skin. When I asked her about

them, startled, she flushed and whispered, "These are the proof of my husband's

love, from the night before," and began to weep. I understood the meaning of those

tears perfectly. She was, in the common parlance, a submissive wife.

Our subsequent interactions became charged with an even stranger passion. I

loved her—and punished her—in ways that went far beyond anything her husband had done.

(Miyamoto Seiichi, Tokyo City Resident, Company Man, 36)

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Extraction / Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Reader Confession / Personal Reportage (「読者の告白」 or 「奇譚愛好者手記」). This format grants the content an air of authenticity/veracity, even if fictionalized. |
| **Author Attribution** | Explicitly attributed: 宮本誠一 氏 (Mr. Miyamoto Seiichi), 会社員 (Company Employee), 三六才 (Age 36), 東京市 (Tokyo City). |
| **Editorial Voice** | Absent in the text block itself. The inclusion of precise metadata (occupation, location, age) strengthens the narrative's claim to be a genuine, documented report. |
| **Narrator Voice** | First-person (私), highly emotive, self-justifying, and sensational. Clinical language (陶酔, 快感, 貞操観念) mixes with fetishistic detail (白い肌, 紅い鞭痕). The narrator explicitly positions himself as the superior, more intense lover and punisher. |
| **Target Audience Signals** | Readers interested in sexual transgression, wartime infidelity, S&M/BDSM dynamics (鞭痕), and the psychological narrative of seducing a "virtuous" woman. Appeals to the male fantasy of dominance and breaking female moral boundaries. |
| **Positioning** | Likely placed in the main body of the magazine, perhaps early in a long-running reader confession column known for documenting unusual sexual practices. Page number 26 suggests it is not introductory material. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Term / Concept | Annotation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **夫を戦地に送つた** | **Wartime Context (Post-1937 or Early Postwar):** This detail is crucial. It immediately establishes the woman (the "War Wife" / 銃後の妻) as socially protected but emotionally vulnerable. Her infidelity (often called *tsumabashiri* in pulp literature) is implicitly excused by the narrator as stemming from *sabishisa* (loneliness), a common narrative device used to justify sexual transgression in wartime Japan when men were absent. |
| **東京市** | **Pre-1943 or Formal Usage:** Tokyo City existed until 1943, when it merged with Tokyo Prefecture to become Tokyo Metropolis (東京都). Its usage here helps date the text to the early to mid-Showa period, or simply reflects the common way people referred to central Tokyo. |
| **貞操観念 (Teiso Kannen)** | **Concept of Chastity/Fidelity:** Refers to the rigid, state-supported ideology of female moral purity and sexual loyalty, especially during the war years, where the wife's virtue was seen as directly tied to the nation's morale. The narrator's desire to "break" this concept is a form of transgressive rebellion against established social order. |
| **紅い鞭痕 (Akai Benkon)** | **S&M/BDSM Practice:** The "red whip marks" are not treated as evidence of domestic abuse but as "proof of love" (愛の証). This normalizes sadomasochistic practices within the marriage bed, indicating that S&M was already an established (though secretive) part of Japanese sexual culture, now being brought into the ero-guro public sphere. This narrative device justifies the narrator's subsequent violence by showing the wife is predisposed to "punishment." |
| **従順なる妻 (Jūjun naru Tsuma)** | **The Obedient Wife:** A domestic ideal, but here twisted to imply a wife who is sexually and physically submissive, not just domestically obedient. The tears suggest internal conflict or pain, but the narrator overrides this by labeling her *jūjun* (submissive/obedient). |
| **会社員 (Kaishain)** | **Office Worker/Salaryman:** The narrator's occupation signals he is an ordinary, urban middle-class man, making his illicit, violent affair more sensational by juxtaposing normality with extreme deviance. |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term | Meaning / Nuance | Euphemistic/Contextual Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **此の女体** (Kono Nyotai) | This female body | Highly objectifying term ("female body/flesh"), emphasizing physical form over personhood. |
| **陶酔** (Tōzui) | Intoxication; ecstasy; rapture | Used here to describe intense, sensual absorption, framing the experience artistically or psychotically, not merely lustfully. |
| **関係した** (Kankei shita) | Related with; connected with | The standard euphemism for "had sexual intercourse with." |
| **求愛** (Kyūai) | Courtship; wooing | Formal term for sexual pursuit; implies the narrator was seeking a lasting, emotional relationship, making her strict refusal more significant. |
| **鞭痕** (Benkon / Muchikizu) | Whip marks | Clinical or literary term for marks left by a whip or lash. Crucial S&M signifier. |
| **愛の証** (Ai no Akashi) | Proof of love; token of affection | Euphemism used by the wife for physical evidence of violent/painful sexual acts inflicted by her husband. |
| **罰した** (Basshita) | Punished | Explicit reference to sadism/discipline. Juxtaposed immediately with "loved" (愛し), linking sexual pleasure directly to physical control and pain. |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

| Theme | Interpretation / Subtext |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infidelity and Wartime Anxiety** | The affair is presented as a consequence of the husband's absence, fulfilling the wife's need for intimacy (寂しさ). Subtext: The home front's moral fabric is fraying under the strain of war, and traditional fidelity is failing. |
| **Domination and Ownership** | The central conflict is the narrator's breaking of her *teiso kannen*. Once broken, the narrator asserts ownership ("身も心も私に捧げた"). He replaces the husband completely, even exceeding him in severity. |
| **BDSM and Pain-Pleasure Cycle** | The discovery of the whip marks is not a deterrent but an *invitation*. It signals to the narrator that the wife is a masochist (従順なる妻), confirming his ability to escalate the violence/control ("夫以上の方法で愛し、そして罰した"). |
| **Voyeurism and Confessional Mode** | The entire narrative is structured to offer the reader prurient access to extreme intimacy and sexual violence behind closed doors, validated by the inclusion of exact names and occupations. The trauma (crying over the scars) is quickly co-opted into the sexual fantasy. |
| **The "Abnormal Passion"** | The relationship moves from standard illicit sex to "abnormal passion" (異常な情熱) immediately following the revelation of the wife's masochism, suggesting the abnormality is rooted in the sadomasochistic dynamic itself. |
