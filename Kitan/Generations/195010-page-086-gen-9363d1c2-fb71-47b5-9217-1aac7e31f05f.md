**男湯**
**番台娘の男湯のぞき**
**西原津夜子**
**沖 研 二**

流れの淀んだ下水のドブの臭いが強く鼻をつく。市内も郊外に近いあんまり生活力も香ばしくないサラリーマン階級の住宅街に建つ、草津温泉長命湯の一人娘、番茶も出花の娘ざかりの民子さんの告白ばなし。
ふゝゝ、変に気を廻しちゃあ厭よ。
何も男湯と限つたからと言つて不思議がなくなつたつていふぢやないの。
女湯の噂話が聞きたいなんて言う男の人の樂屋が覗きたいの。あら、あんたに当てつけた積りぢやあないの。御免なさい。
で、男湯の話…………。
入口を背負つて四尺高い番台から見下したお話よ。おかしな言分ですけれど、人目につく程の器量で年頃のあたしでしょ（笑わないでよ）隨分氣のあるらしい方だつて、簡單に言えない位、大有りよ。
そろゝゝあたしの存在を特異な眼差で見詰めめる様な大きなお子さんを持つお父さんが、帰りがけに番台の下へのつそり近寄つて、
「家内のが、来ていないかい？」ですつて。
御冗談でしょう。今頃はあなたのお内儀さんが北海道産の、べたがれいの加工に忙しいことは先刻御承知ぢやありませんか。でも真面目に返事をしてやらなきやならないの。
お母さんが番台に立つている時なんか決して聞かないんですつて。
あなたのお仲間とは言いませんが、番台に煙草の火をせがむ人がるのよ。
「机にありますわ」とマッチの大箱を指差すと、
「あそこ迄行くのは面倒くせえや」
これでよく家庭運を減らさずに帰れること。結局マッチをすつてやつると、青蛙の様な猪首を延ばして、あたしの膝にのびあがつて、煙草の話が出たから、ついでに、一つつ二つ喫煙家の話をしましょうか。
ねえ、煙草を吸う人はおつとり落着いた人でしょうか、それとも、そゝつかしい人が多いでしょうか。
机の上にあるマッチの大箱から軸木をとつて煙草に火をつけて、きつと灰皿と間違えたんでしょう。燃え

大丸の女店員と称する女、郵便局の女事務員保険会社のタイピスト、病院の看護婦等とそれぞれ稱せられる女達、書は洋裁に通つていますというのが、彼女の常道である。
世はまさにアルバイト時代である。夜の商賣が本業であつても、副業であつても、お客にとつては、そんなことは大した事ではない。
彼女たちは、それを職業として生活しているのに、素人と稱するところに、「誇りと慰め」を持ち、「素人はいいこ」と喜んでいるのだ。
嘘をついても、それが方便なら坊主が嘘をついても許されるものであるらしいが女が男をだますとゆうのは、狐が人間をだますよりあたりまえであるらしい。
――弟が半身不隨で、小説家になろうとして一生懸命勉強している。毎日家に引込んでは、原稿用紙に小説を書いて暮している。
元よりその小説なるものは賣れる譯がないから姉弟二人の收入の道がない、しかも弟は毎日バットを十個位空けないと芸術的衝動が起きない。煙草がないと憂鬱な顔をして頭の毛を掻きむしつてばかりいる。

**Men's Bath: The Bandai Girl's Peeping at the Men's Bath**
**Nishihara Yakoyuko, Oki Kenji**

Stagnant flowing sewer ditch's smell strongly hits the nose. In a residential area for the salaryman class whose vitality is not so fragrant, near the suburbs of the city, stands the Kusatsu Onsen Chomeiyu. This is the confession story of the only daughter, Tamiko-san, who is in the bloom of youth (like tea at its first pouring).
"Heh heh heh, it's unpleasant if you overthink things in a strange way. Just because it's limited to the men's bath doesn't mean the mystery has disappeared, does it? I want to peek into the 'backstage' of men who say they want to hear rumors from the female bath. Oh, I didn't mean that as a jab at you. Forgive me.
So, the story of the men's bath....
It is a story looked down upon from the four-foot-high bandai (attendant booth) with my back to the entrance. It's a strange thing to say, but for a girl of age with looks that catch the eye (don't laugh!), there are so many men who seem quite interested that I can't simply count them.
Slowly, a father with a large son, who stares at my existence with a peculiar gaze, wanders near the bottom of the bandai on his way out and says, 'Is my wife here?'
You must be joking. By now, don't you already know that your wife is busy processing Hokkaido-produced flatfish? But I have to give a serious answer. I hear they never ask when my mother is standing at the bandai.
I won't say it's your friends, but there are people who beg for a light for their cigarette at the bandai. When I point to the large box of matches and say 'It's on the desk,' they say 'It's a pain to go over there.' How they can go home without decreasing their family luck like that. In the end, when I strike a match for them, they extend their thick bull-neck like a tree frog and stretch up to my knees... Speaking of cigarettes, shall I tell one or two stories about smokers?
Say, do you think people who smoke are calm and composed, or are there many who are restless? Taking a matchstick from the large box on the desk and lighting a cigarette, he surely must have mistaken it for an ashtray. Burning..."

**Inchi Kitan (Licentious/Fake Tales) — The Prostitute Who Sells a Straight Line (Sincerity) —**
**Yumi Sakue**

When men get tired of professional women, their appetite eventually turns toward amateur women. The reason "Pan-pan girls" prospered immediately after the end of the war was likely because their amateurishness, not looking like professionals, appealed to men's tastes.
Consequently, the "Pan-suke" who have now become completely professionalized have lost their former freshness and have become "corporatized" to the point of being no different from the prostitutes of the old red-light districts.
Women who claim to be department store clerks at Daimaru, female clerks at the post office, typists at insurance companies, nurses at hospitals, and so on; saying they "go to dressmaking school" during the day is their standard line.
The world is truly in an era of "Arubaito" (side jobs). Whether night business is a main job or a side job does not matter much to the customer. Even though they live by it as a profession, by claiming to be amateurs, they find "pride and consolation" and rejoice that "amateurs are good."
If telling a lie is a "convenient means" (hōben), it seems even a priest is allowed to lie, so a woman deceiving a man seems more natural than a fox deceiving a human.
"—My younger brother is hemiplegic and is studying hard to become a novelist. Every day he shuts himself in the house and lives by writing novels on manuscript paper. Of course, such novels cannot sell, so there is no source of income for the two siblings. Furthermore, my brother cannot get an artistic impulse unless he empties about ten packs of 'Bat' (cigarettes) every day. If there are no cigarettes, he makes a gloomy face and just scratches his head. For my brother's art, I, the older sister, endure shame and sell my body like this. If my brother knew about this, he would surely break his fountain pen and commit suicide—"
She sighs with tears in her eyes, looking serious.
Even to a guest accustomed to play, there is no way this doesn't "ping" (ring as a lie). However...

**The Men's Bath: A View from the Attendant's Perch**
**By Nishihara Yakoyuko & Oki Kenji**

The pungent stench of stagnant sewage hangs heavy in the air of this neighborhood. Here, in a residential district inhabited by the struggling salaryman class on the city's outskirts, stands the "Kusatsu Onsen Chomeiyu." This is the confession of Tamiko, the bathhouse's only daughter, a young woman in the very bloom of her youth.
"Hehe, now don't go getting the wrong idea. Just because I’m talking about the men’s bath doesn’t mean the mystery is gone. I simply want to peer into the private lives of those men who are always so eager to hear gossip from the women’s side. Oh, I didn’t mean you specifically! Forgive me.
So, about the men’s side...
I see it all from my perch on the *bandai*, four feet above the floor, with my back to the entrance. It sounds a bit vain, but being a girl of my age with—dare I say—noticeable looks (don’t laugh!), the number of men who seem interested is more than I can count.
Take, for instance, the fathers who come in with their grown sons. They’ll stare at me with a peculiar look, then linger by the booth as they leave, casually asking, 'Is my wife in there?' 
What a joke! You know perfectly well your wife is at home right now, busy processing dried flatfish from Hokkaido. Yet, I have to give them a straight answer. Apparently, they never dare ask such things when my mother is the one sitting on the *bandai*.
Then there are those—I won't say they’re friends of yours—who beg for a light for their cigarettes. When I point to the matchbox on my desk, they grumble, 'Ugh, walking all the way over there is too much work.' I wonder how they manage to keep their households together with that attitude. When I finally strike a match for them, they stretch their thick necks like bullfrogs, leaning right up to my knees..."

**Curious Tales of Folly: The Prostitute and Her "Sincerity"**
**By Yumi Sakue**

Once a man grows weary of professional sex workers, his interest inevitably drifts toward the "amateur." The "Pan-pan girls" flourished after the war precisely because their lack of professional polish appealed to masculine tastes. Today, however, these women have become so professionalized that they are indistinguishable from the common prostitutes of old.
They claim to be clerks at Daimaru, postal workers, typists, or nurses. Their standard excuse is that they spend their days at dressmaking school. We live in an age of the "side hustle." To the customer, it matters little if the "night business" is her primary or secondary job. Yet, by clinging to the label of "amateur," these women find a sense of pride and consolation.
They say that if a lie serves a purpose, even a priest is forgiven for it; if so, a woman deceiving a man is surely more natural than a fox bewitching a human.
One woman tearfully sighs, spinning a tragic tale: "My brother is paralyzed and spends his days struggling to become a novelist. His work doesn't sell, so we have no income. He needs ten packs of cigarettes a day just to find his muse. If he runs out, he falls into a dark despair. I endure this shame and sell my body for his art. If he ever found out, he would surely break his pen and end his life."
To a seasoned regular, the lie is transparent. And yet...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is split into two distinct horizontal zones. The top half is dedicated to a "light" reportage piece (*shinsetsu* style), while the bottom half is a "darker" piece of fiction or social commentary.
*   **Typography:** The title "男湯" (Men's Bath) uses a very large, bold, hand-drawn font style. The bottom title "淫痴奇譚" (Inchi Kitan) uses a stylized, slightly "shady" font typical of *Kasutori* magazines.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The use of an illustration (a man at the bathhouse) provides a visual anchor for the top story. The author's names are placed prominently in both sections.
*   **Column Structure:** Standard vertical Japanese text (tategaki). The top section is denser, while the bottom section uses more paragraph breaks for dramatic effect.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Use of parenthesis for "asides" (e.g., "(Don't laugh!)"). Use of emphasis dots (bou-ten) next to certain characters in the bottom section to highlight keywords like "pride and consolation."

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** Late 1940s to early 1950s. This was the era of the *Kasutori* magazine—cheap, sensationalist publications printed on low-quality paper that usually folded after three issues (hence the name, referring to a cheap sake that leaves one hungover after three cups).
*   **Pan-pan Girls:** Post-war streetwalkers who primarily catered to the Allied occupation forces. As the article notes, they were initially seen as "amateurs" compared to the traditional *yūjo* (licensed prostitutes) of the pre-war era.
*   **Bandai (番台):** The high station in a Japanese public bath (*sento*) where the attendant sits. Historically, the attendant (often a woman) could see into both the men's and women's sides to prevent theft and monitor the boiler/water levels.
*   **"Arubaito" (アルバイト):** A loanword from German *Arbeit*. In the post-war era, it became a buzzword for the many desperate "side jobs" people took to survive the hyperinflation and food shortages.
*   **Golden Bat (ゴールデンバット):** Often referred to simply as "Bat." It was a popular, cheap cigarette brand mentioned in the bottom story as the "necessity" for the starving artist brother.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **番茶も出花 (Bancha mo dehana):** A proverb meaning "even coarse tea is fragrant when first poured." It refers to the idea that every girl is beautiful at the height of her youth.
*   **淫痴 (Inchi):** A pun on *inchiki* (fake/cheating), but written with the kanji for "lewd/obscene" (淫) and "foolish" (痴).
*   **パン助 (Pan-suke):** A derogatory slang term for *Pan-pan* girls.
*   **猪首 (Ikubi):** Literally "boar neck"—a short, thick, powerful neck.
*   **方便 (Hōben):** From the Buddhist term *upaya*. A "white lie" or "expedient means" used to lead someone to the truth or a better outcome.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and the "Male Gaze":** The top article flips the typical male voyeurism by having a young girl describe the men she sees from the *bandai*. It plays with the erotic tension of the public bathhouse while maintaining a "humorous reportage" tone.
*   **The "Amateur" vs. "Professional":** The bottom article explores the fetishization of "amateurs" in the post-war sex trade. It suggests that the "amateur" status is often a marketing lie or a psychological shield for the women involved.
*   **Post-War Desperation:** The tragic story of the sister selling her body for her paralyzed brother's "art" and cigarette habit reflects the extreme social dislocation and poverty of the era. The narrator's cynicism ("to a seasoned regular, the lie is transparent") highlights the erosion of trust in post-war society.
