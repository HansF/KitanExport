## Output

```
This text is a classic example of **Kasutori (dregs) literature** from the late 1940s/early 1950s Japan. These magazines were known for their mix of pulp fiction, sensational journalism, and eroticism, often focusing on the gritty reality of post-war life, specifically the "red-light" districts and the "pan-pan" girls (streetwalkers).

## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

すし詰めの満員の中で、彼女達に押されたり突かれたり足を踏まれたりして、君はニヤニヤしておればよいのである。
此れで京都の端から乗り換えをするとしても往復八圓也。気に入ったら二三回往復するのもよかろう。
取締りのきつい昨今でも、勇敢なお嬢さんは入口にぶら下つていると言う有様であるから、君のやり方一つでは結構面白く娯しめると言うものである。

**四、煙草と私娼**

女学生では色気がないと言われるなら、そんな方には特別濃厚な方面を御案内するとしよう。
清らかな加茂川の流れとは又此れはかけ離れた、汚濁に淀んだ高瀬川に沿つてゆくと、闇市場の近くに鹽小路――柳原から東九条にかけての私娼窟が、三ヶ所ばかりある。
工場の煤煙の底に沈んだゴタゴタした裏通りに面した方である。
京都駅からだと、ブラブラ散歩がてら行けるが、遠くの人であれば往復四圓の電車賃を払わねばならない世はインフレの最中である。いくら金がなくて遊べると言つたつて、三十圓で遊べると言う所は、そうざらに有るわけではない。
しかも四圓電車賃に使えばあと二十六圓也である。ここで二十六圓を最も有効に使うために、先づ君は配給ののぞみを念入りに巻いて十本ばかり、ケースがなければ、ピースの空箱へでも入れて持つてゆかねばならない。
お粗末なトタン屋根の長屋が軒を接している細い露路を歩いてゆくと両側の家の窓から、白首の女が呼ぶ「ちよッ――ちよいとにいさん」「寄つておいきやすなア――」
「ネ、ねワーばん」
（ワーばんとは和服の事、洋服を着ているとヨーばんと言われる）
「どこへ行きはりますねん。だんなはん此處で遊んでおいきやす」
と言つた調子に呼び方にも色々ある。その中でも殊更、君に気を持たせる様な声があつたらちょっと立ち止まつて見返すすがよい。
女は小さな窓から媚を含んだ流し目を送つてくる。此方からもニタッと笑つてみせる。
女が手まねき藁の様に顔を寄せて小刻みに招ねくのに、つられた様に窓の傍へよつてやれば小声で囁く
「遊んでくれはる？」
「近頃、どうだい、暇かね？」
「さっぱり、暇で……ね、おうちよろ入おすやろ」
女はどこ迄もビジネスだ。ビジネスである限り早く片付けねばならない。早く片付けるためには媚態を示す必要がある。此の媚態に参つてナマコの様になつては、三十圓では済まなくなる。
「よう、よぉ……」
女は身体をくねらせて攻撃は激しさを加えてくる、然しそれには係らないで、用意の煙草をとり出して火をつける、これが此方の手だ。そこで女は必ず言う。
「ね、妾にも一本、くれへん？」
若し言わなければ、そんなことは十中八九ないが、もしあつたらその女に構わずさつさと次

これで京都の端から乗り換えをするとしても往復八円なり。気に入ったら二、三回往復するのもよかろう。
取り締まりのきつい昨今でも、勇敢なお嬢さんは入り口にぶら下がっているという有様であるから、君のやり方一つでは結構面白く楽しめるというものである。

**四、煙草と私娼**

「女学生では色気がない」と言われるなら、そんな方には特別濃厚な方面をご案内するとしよう。
清らかな鴨川の流れとはまたこれはかけ離れた、汚濁に淀んだ高瀬川に沿ってゆくと、闇市場の近くに塩小路――柳原から東九条にかけての私娼窟（ししょうくつ）が、三ヶ所ばかりある。
工場の煤煙の底に沈んだゴタゴタした裏通りに面した方である。
京都駅からだと、ブラブラ散歩がてら行けるが、遠くの人であれば往復四円の電車賃を払わねばならない。世はインフレの最中である。いくら金がなくて遊べるといったって、三十円で遊べると言う所は、そうざらに有るわけではない。
しかも四円を電車賃に使えば、あとは二十六円なりである。ここで二十六円を最も有効に使うために、まず君は配給の「のぞみ」を念入りに巻いて十本ばかり、ケースがなければ「ピース」の空き箱にでも入れて持って行かねばならない。
お粗末なトタン屋根の長屋が軒を接している細い路地を歩いてゆくと、両側の家の窓から、白首（しろくび）の女が呼ぶ。「ちょっと――ちょっとお兄さん」「寄っていきなさいな――」
「ねえ、ねえ、和（ワー）ばん」
（和ばんとは和服のこと、洋服を着ていると洋（ヨー）ばんと言われる）
「どこへ行きはるんですか。旦那さん、ここで遊んでいってください」
といった調子に、呼び方にも色々ある。その中でもことさら、君に気を持たせるような声があったら、ちょっと立ち止まって見返すとよい。
女は小さな窓から媚を含んだ流し目を送ってくる。こちらからもニタッと笑ってみせる。
女が手招きし、藁（わら）のように顔を寄せて小刻みに招くのに、つられたように窓のそばへ寄ってやれば、小声で囁く。
「遊んでくれる？」
「近頃、どうだい、暇かね？」
「さっぱり、暇で……ねえ、お家（うち）へ入っておくれやす」
女はどこまでもビジネスだ。ビジネスである限り早く片付けねばならない。早く片付けるためには媚態（びたい）を示す必要がある。この媚態に参ってナマコのようになっては、三十円では済まなくなる。
「よう、よぉ……」
女は身体をくねらせて攻撃は激しさを加えてくる。しかし、それには乗らないで、用意の煙草を取り出して火をつける。これがこちらの術だ。そこで女は必ず言う。
「ねえ、私にも一本、くれない？」
もし言わなければ（そんなことは十中八九ないが）、もしあったらその女には構わずさっさと次へ……

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

In the sushi-packed fullness, by them being pushed, poked, or feet stepped on, you [should] just be grinning.
With this, even if transferring from the edge of Kyoto, round trip [is] 8 yen. If you like it, doing 2-3 round trips might be good.
Even these days when crackdowns are strict, the state is that brave young ladies are hanging at the entrances, so depending on your method, it is something you can enjoy quite interestingly.

**4. Tobacco and Private Prostitution**

If it is said that "female students lack sex appeal," for such a person, I shall guide you to a particularly rich/thick direction.
Separated far from the pure flow of the Kamo River, going along the Takase River stagnating with filth, near the black market in Shiokoji—from Yanagihara to Higashikujo—there are about three private prostitution dens.
It is toward the messy backstreets sunk at the bottom of factory soot.
From Kyoto Station, one can go while wandering/strolling, but for a person from far away, one must pay a 4 yen round-trip train fare. The world is in the midst of inflation. No matter how much it is said one can play without money, places where one can play for 30 yen are not so commonly existing.
Moreover, if 4 yen is used for train fare, the remainder is 26 yen. Here, to use 26 yen most effectively, first you must carefully roll about ten of the rationed "Nozomi" [cigarettes], and if there is no case, put them in an empty box of "Peace" and take them.
Walking through a narrow alley where shabby tin-roofed row houses touch eaves, from the windows of houses on both sides, white-necked women call. "Hey—just a moment, older brother." "Stop by and come in—"
"Hey, hey, Wa-ban."
(Wa-ban refers to Japanese clothes; if wearing Western clothes, it is called Yo-ban.)
"Where are you going? Master, please play here."
In such a tone, there are various ways of calling. Among them, especially if there is a voice that seems to make you feel interested, it is good to stop a little and look back.
The woman sends an amorous sidelong glance from the small window. From this side, try to show a smirk.
When the woman beckons, bringing her face close like straw and beckoning in small movements, if you are lured and approach the window, she whispers in a small voice:
"Will you play [with me]?"
"How is it lately? Are you free?"
"Completely free... hey, please enter the house."
The woman is business to the end. As long as it is business, it must be finished quickly. To finish quickly, it is necessary to show coquetry. If you are defeated by this coquetry and become like a sea cucumber, it will not end at 30 yen.
"Yo, yoo..."
The woman twists her body and the attack adds intensity. However, without being involved in that, take out the prepared tobacco and light it. This is the move from this side. Then, the woman will surely say:
"Hey, won't you give me one, too?"
If she doesn't say it—though that is ten to one not the case—if that happens, without minding that woman, quickly to the next...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

In the middle of a train packed as tight as a sushi box, getting jostled, poked, and having your toes crushed by the girls, you can’t help but stand there with a leering grin. A round trip from the outskirts of Kyoto, even with transfers, only sets you back eight yen. If you find the ride to your liking, you might as well go back and forth two or three times. Even with the police cracking down lately, you'll still see "brave young ladies" loitering at the entrances. With the right approach, there’s plenty of fun to be had.

**IV. Tobacco and the Streetwalker**

If you find schoolgirls lack "flavor," let me guide you to a far more pungent district. Far removed from the pristine waters of the Kamo River, if you follow the filth-choked Takase River toward the black markets of Shiokoji—stretching from Yanagihara to Higashikujo—you’ll find about three clusters of brothels. These are tucked away in the chaotic back-alleys, drowned under a layer of industrial soot.

From Kyoto Station, it’s a leisurely stroll, but those coming from afar must contend with a four-yen round-trip tram fare. We are, after all, in the middle of runaway inflation. No matter how much people claim you can have a night on the town for pennies, finding a place where thirty yen actually buys you something is rare. If you spend four yen on the tram, you’re left with exactly twenty-six yen. To make that twenty-six yen go as far as possible, you must first take your rationed "Nozomi" tobacco, roll about ten cigarettes with care, and—if you lack a proper case—tuck them into an empty "Peace" box before heading out.

As you navigate the narrow alleys where wretched tin-roofed shacks huddle together, women with powdered white necks call out from the windows: "Hey there, handsome!" "Stop in for a bit!" "Hey, 'Wa-ban'!" ("Wa-ban" means you're wearing Japanese clothes; if you’re in a Western suit, they call you "Yo-ban.") "Where are you heading, sir? Come play with us here."

There are many ways they try to hook you. If you hear a voice that specifically seems to target your ego, stop for a second and look back. The woman will shoot you a suggestive, sidelong glance from her tiny window. Grin back at her. As she beckons you closer, her face pressed against the frame like a bundle of straw, go to the window as if lured by a spell. She’ll whisper:

"Want to play?"
"How's business lately? Looking for a customer?"
"Totally dead... Come on, won't you step inside?"

Make no mistake: for her, this is strictly business. And in business, time is money. To get the job done quickly, she has to pour on the charm. But be careful—if you succumb to her coquetry and turn into a spineless jelly, thirty yen won't be nearly enough to cover the bill.

"Hey, hey now..."
She writhes her body, intensifying the "attack." Your best defense? Ignore the performance, pull out your pre-rolled cigarette, and light it. That’s the winning move. Without fail, she’ll say:
"Hey, won't you give me one, too?"

If she doesn't—and that’s a one-in-ten chance—just move on to the next window...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a traditional vertical (tategaki) layout. It is divided into two main text blocks (top and bottom) with a large, central illustration.
*   **Typography:** The body text is a standard Mincho typeface typical of mid-century printing. The section header "四、煙草と私娼" (4. Tobacco and Private Prostitution) is slightly larger and bolder.
*   **Illustration:** The centerpiece is a "bijin-ga" (beautiful woman) style illustration, but with a post-war, slightly erotic edge. It depicts two women; one is partially disrobed (exposing a shoulder/back) and appears to be applying makeup or fixing her hair, while the other looks on. The style is reminiscent of "pulp" magazine art—alluring but slightly coarse.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is positioned in the upper-middle left, leading the eye into the lower half of the text. The illustration acts as a "honey trap" to draw the reader into the narrative.
*   **Era Indicators:** The use of "圓" (old kanji for Yen) and references to "Peace" cigarettes and "Nozomi" rations firmly place this in the immediate post-WWII era.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Magazines:** Named after a cheap, dregs-based shochu, these magazines flourished during the US Occupation (1945–1952). They were often printed on low-quality paper and focused on the "3S" (Screen, Sex, Sports), providing an escape from the harsh reality of starvation and poverty.
*   **Post-War Inflation:** The text mentions a 30-yen price for "playing" (prostitution). In the late 40s, inflation was rampant. For context, in 1946, a "Peace" cigarette pack (10 sticks) cost 7 yen, but by 1948, prices had skyrocketed. The "30 yen" figure suggests a very cheap, low-end brothel.
*   **Tobacco Rations:** "Nozomi" was a low-grade, rationed cigarette brand. "Peace," launched in 1946, was a premium brand. Carrying "Nozomi" in a "Peace" box was a common way for men to feign higher status—a "fake it 'til you make it" strategy for the post-war slums.
*   **Geography of Kyoto:** The text mentions **Shiokoji**, **Yanagihara**, and **Higashikujo**. Historically, these areas near Kyoto Station were associated with marginalized communities (Burakumin) and became hubs for black markets and "illegal" (private) prostitution after the war.
*   **Pan-pan Girls:** While the term "private prostitute" (私娼) is used, these women were colloquially known as *pan-pan-gaaru*. They often operated out of tiny shacks or windows in designated "red-line" or "blue-line" districts.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **白首 (Shirokubi):** Literally "white neck." An archaic or slang term for a low-ranking prostitute, referring to the heavy white face powder (o-shiroi) they wore.
*   **和ばん / 洋ばん (Wa-ban / Yo-ban):** Post-war slang. "Wa" (Japanese) and "Yo" (Western) combined with "Number" (ban). It was a way for streetwalkers to categorize customers based on their attire.
*   **媚態 (Bitai):** Coquetry, flirtatious behavior, or "sex appeal" used as a sales tactic.
*   **ナマコ (Namako):** Sea cucumber. Used here metaphorically to describe a man who has lost his resolve or become "soft" and easily manipulated by a woman's charms.
*   **おうちよろ入おすやろ (O-uchi yoro o-yasu yaro):** A heavily stylized Kyoto-ben (dialect) invitation to enter the house.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Business" of Survival:** The author repeatedly emphasizes that the encounter is "business" (ビジネス). There is no romance here; it is a transactional struggle between a man trying to save money and a woman trying to extract it.
*   **Cynicism and Voyeurism:** The tone is that of a "street-smart" guide. It encourages a cynical, almost predatory detachment. The reader is advised to use tobacco as a "tactical tool" to regain the upper hand in negotiations.
*   **The Contrast of Kyoto:** The text purposefully contrasts the "pure" Kamo River (the tourist version of Kyoto) with the "filthy" Takase River (the reality of the poor). It celebrates the "pulp" side of the ancient capital.
*   **Masculinity in Defeat:** Post-war men had lost their status along with the war. The "battle" described here isn't one of military might, but a petty economic skirmish in a brothel window.
