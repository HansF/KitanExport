「えつ、家賃がたまつてますか、ぼくはあれに渡しておいたのに、」
「人にはいろんな事情もあるもんやし催促するのも悪いと思つてましたんやけどな、」

（五）

　日が経つにつれて、あちらから五千円、こちらから二千円、と借金の催促に来た。
　皆彼の知らない借財である、卅二三位の男と歩いているのを、よく見掛けた、という人の噂もよく聞いた。
　卯一郎は、子供もその男の子だろうと思つた。時鳥が自分の卵を鶯に抱かす様に、おれはまんまと欺されていたのだ。
　あんなにまで可愛がつて、抱いたり手を引いてやつた子供の守が嫌わしくなつて、艶子の親に預けつ放しにした。流石に彼女の親は恐縮して、無条件で子供の世話を引き受けた。子供は気散じで一人でよく遊んだ。
　二年間も我が子と信じていたのは、外の男の子であり、妻が生んだ実の子は可愛い盛りに死んでしまつた。
　一遍に二人の父親になつた晴々しい気持だつたあの時から、僅か二年、二人の子供を失つてしまつた。やつぱりおれは子無しの孤独な男になる因縁を持つているのだと思う。
　卯一郎は貧乏に育つたので、芸者の様な金のかかる女を持つ事を、一種の見栄だと思つていた。細心に頭が働くので、女を欺した事はあつても、欺された事はない。
　あの女はおれより遙かに役者が上だつた。嫌でも認めざるを得ない。
　借財のある二階をいつまでも借りているわけにも行かず、借りている店先の一帖程のゆとりのある所で寝起きしました。
　一度に妻子を失つた一人寝の味気なさ彼は菊代を思い出して、後悔のほぞをかんだ。
　夫を失い子を失つた彼女も、きつと今の自分と同じ心境だつたに違いない。
　そうだ。もう一度菊代の許に帰つて、いい子を産ませよう彼女は喜んで俺を迎えてくれるだろう。
　健康な女の笑顔が目にちらついて、一日も早く菊代の廣い、暖かな胸に抱かれてみたい慾望に、彼は久し振りに石切の家へ帰つていつた。
　ところが石切の家には知らない人が入つていた。隣の人に聞いてみると、
「まあ、隨分お久し振りですこと、あんた奥さんのこと御存じやおまへんのか、」
「何ぞ変つたことでもおましたのか」
「十年振りに出来た、可愛い子供に死なれて、菊代さんは淋しそうにしてはりましたが、そんな苦労した女なら、よくしてくれるに違いないと、この町の有力者の多田さんの後妻に見込まれていきはりました。多田さんは先妻との間に子供がなかつたので、菊代さんも後妻いうたかつて新婚みたいなもので、えらい仲ようて、いつて直ぐ妊娠して今三月だす。ほんまにええ奥さんになりました。ここにいてはる時は、毎日一生懸命ミシン踏んでるような働きではありましたが心掛けのよい人には、えゝむくいがあるものですわ、」
　子供がないからと、籍に入れてやらなかつた妻、十年目に子供が出来た時は、艶子に気兼ねして、子供の籍すら入れてやらなかつたのだから、自分が寄りつかねば事実上離婚であり、菊代が自分に断らず再婚しても、文句の持つていき処もない。
　石切の町はずれの、芒がかすかにゆらいでいる土堤のあたりを、彼は放心した様に歩きつづけていた。――了。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Eh, the rent is accumulated? I had handed [it] to her..."
"People have various circumstances and I thought it was bad to urge [you], but..."

(5)

As days passed, from there 5,000 yen, from here 2,000 yen, demands for debt payment came.
All were debts he did not know. Rumors of people saying they often saw [her] walking with a man of about 32 or 33 years were also often heard.
Uichirō thought, the child must be that man's boy too. Like a cuckoo making a bush warbler hatch its own egg, I was completely deceived.
The child he had loved so much, hugged, and led by the hand—looking after him became hateful, and he left the child with Tsuyako's parents. As expected, her parents were apologetic and took over the care of the child unconditionally. The child was carefree and played well alone.
The one he believed for two years was his own child was another man's boy, and the biological child his wife gave birth to had died at his cutest age.
From that time when he had the cheerful feeling of becoming a father to two at once, in just two years, he had lost two children. After all, I think I have the fate to be a childless, lonely man.
Because Uichirō grew up poor, having a woman who costs money like a geisha, he thought of as a kind of vanity. Because his head worked meticulously, though he had deceived women, he had never been deceived.
That woman was a far better actor than I. Whether I like it or not, I must admit it.
Unable to keep renting the second floor where debts remained, he slept and woke in a space of about one tatami mat at the front of the shop he was renting.
The tastelesness of sleeping alone having lost wife and child at once. He remembered Kikuyo and bit his navel in regret.
She, who lost a husband and lost a child, must have surely been in the same state of mind as his current self.
That's right. Return to Kikuyo's place once more, and have her bear a good child. She will gladly welcome me.
A healthy woman's smile flickering in his eyes, with the desire to be held in Kikuyo's wide, warm breast as soon as possible, he went back to the house in Ishikiri for the first time in a long while.
However, in the Ishikiri house, a person he didn't know had entered. When he asked the neighbor,
"Oh, it has been quite a long time. Do you not know about your wife?"
"Has something changed?"
"Having her cute child, who was born after ten years, die, Kikuyo-san was acting lonely, but [someone thought] if she is a woman who suffered such hardships, she will surely treat [him] well, and she was scouted to be the second wife of the town's influential person, Tada-san. Since Tada-san had no children with his previous wife, even though Kikuyo-san is a second wife, it's like a honeymoon; they are very close, and she got pregnant immediately after going and is now three months [along]. She really became a good wife. When she was here, she worked hard like she was treading a sewing machine every day, but for a person with a good heart, there are good rewards."
The wife he did not put in the family register because there were no children. When a child was born in the tenth year, out of consideration for Tsuyako, he didn't even put the child in the register, so if he didn't come around, it was a de facto divorce, and even if Kikuyo remarried without asking him, there was no place to bring a complaint.
Near the embankment where the silver grass was faintly swaying at the edge of the town of Ishikiri, he continued to walk as if in a daze. -- End.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"What? The rent is past due? But I gave her the money for it..."
"Well, everyone has their struggles, and I felt bad about pressing you, but the situation is what it is..."

(5)

As the days crawled by, collectors began appearing from every direction—five thousand yen from one, two thousand from another—all demanding repayment for debts he knew nothing about. He also began to hear whispers from neighbors: "We often saw her out walking with a man, thirty-two or thirty-three years old."

Uichirō realized then that the boy must be that man’s child as well. Like a cuckoo dropping its egg in a bush warbler’s nest to be raised by another, he had been utterly and completely played for a fool.
The child he had once doted upon, held in his arms, and guided by the hand suddenly became an object of loathing. He abandoned the boy with Tsuyako’s parents. To their credit, the parents were mortified and took the child back without a word. The boy, seemingly untroubled, continued to play happily by himself.

For two years, he had believed he was a father, yet the child he raised belonged to another man, while the biological son his wife had actually borne had died in the prime of his childhood. Only two years had passed since that jubilant moment when he thought he had become a father to two at once, and now both were gone. He was forced to conclude that it was simply his destiny to be a man alone, forever childless.

Having grown up in poverty, Uichirō had always viewed keeping an expensive, geisha-like woman as a mark of status. He prided himself on his sharp, calculating mind; he was a man who deceived women, never one to be deceived by them. But that woman had been a far better performer than he. Bitter as it was, he had to admit defeat.

Unable to keep the second-story apartment burdened by debt, he took to sleeping in a tiny, one-mat corner of the shop he rented. In the hollow misery of sleeping alone, having lost both wife and child in one fell swoop, his thoughts turned to Kikuyo. He was overcome with a gnawing, agonizing regret.

Kikuyo, who had lost both husband and child—surely she had felt exactly as he did now. 
*That’s it,* he thought. *I’ll go back to Kikuyo. We’ll have another child together. She’ll be happy to have me back.* 
Haunted by the memory of her healthy, vibrant smile and yearning for the solace of her warm embrace, he set out for his old home in Ishikiri for the first time in ages.

But when he arrived, he found strangers living in the house. He questioned a neighbor.
"Goodness, it’s been ages! Don't you know what happened to your wife?" the neighbor asked.
"Has something happened?"
"Well, after she lost that sweet child she finally had after ten years, she was so terribly lonely. But Mr. Tada, a powerful man in town, decided that a woman who had endured such hardship would surely make a fine companion. He took her as his second wife. Since he had no children from his first marriage, it’s like a second youth for them. They’re inseparable. She got pregnant almost immediately; she’s three months along now. She’s become a wonderful lady of the house. When she lived here, she worked herself to the bone at that sewing machine every day, but I suppose a good heart always finds its reward in the end."

Because they had no children, he had never officially registered her as his wife. And when a child finally arrived in their tenth year, he hadn't even registered the boy, out of some misplaced sense of obligation to Tsuyako. Since he had simply stopped coming around, it was a divorce in all but name. Kikuyo had every right to remarry without his consent; he didn't have a leg to stand on.

Uichirō wandered aimlessly toward the outskirts of Ishikiri, where the autumn silver grass swayed faintly along the embankment, walking like a man who had lost his soul. 

-- End.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese magazine format from the mid-20th century. It utilizes a three-column vertical layout (*tategaki*).
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface. Note the use of "small" kana (though in this era, *sokuon* like 「つ」 were often written the same size as regular characters, as seen in 「たまつて」). It uses the iteration mark (々) in words like 「晴々しい」.
*   **Illustration:** A hand-drawn illustration occupies the center-right of the page. It depicts a woman (presumably Kikuyo) working at a manual treadle sewing machine, while a man (Uichirō) is shown in profile at the top right, looking downcast. The art style is reminiscent of "Gekiga" or early post-war magazine illustrations—expressive but somewhat stark.
*   **Paging:** The number (61) is at the bottom center, and the section marker （五） (Part 5) indicates this is part of a series. The final mark 「――了。」 (End) signifies the conclusion of this particular story or chapter.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s to 1950s. The mention of "5,000 yen" as a significant debt and the use of manual sewing machines suggest the early post-war period.
*   **Ishikiri (石切):** A real location in Higashiosaka, famous for the Ishikiri Tsurugiya Shrine. The dialogue uses subtle Kansai-ben (Osaka dialect) markers like 「～はります」(honorific verb ending) and 「～だす」(polite copula), which fits the setting.
*   **The Family Register (Koseki):** The plot hinges on the *Koseki* system. In pre-modern and early modern Japan, "marriage" was often social rather than legal until the wife was entered into the husband's family register. Uichirō’s failure to register Kikuyo or their child meant they had no legal protection, reflecting the patriarchal and often precarious nature of domestic life for women at the time.
*   **The "Cuckoo" Metaphor:** The text mentions 「時鳥が自分の卵を鶯に抱かす」 (A cuckoo making a bush warbler hatch its egg). This is a classic literary metaphor for brood parasitism, used here to describe Uichirō being tricked into raising another man's child.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **後悔のほぞをかむ (Kōkai no hozo o kamu):** Literally "to bite one's navel in regret." It is a common Japanese idiom meaning to feel deep, bitter, and futile regret.
*   **役者が上 (Yakusha ga ue):** Literally "a better actor." Used idiomatically to mean someone is more cunning or skilled at deception than oneself.
*   **気散じ (Kisanji):** Carefree, distracted, or seeking diversion. It describes the child’s innocent detachment from the adult drama.
*   **因縁 (Innen):** Fate, karma, or a predestined connection. Uichirō uses it to justify his loneliness as something inescapable.
*   **見栄 (Mie):** Vanity, show, or appearance. Uichirō admits his relationship with a "geisha-like" woman was purely for status.
*   **芒 (Suski):** Japanese silver grass. In literature, it often symbolizes autumn, loneliness, and the transience of life.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Karmic Retribution (Inus and Outs):** The story is a moral tale about "sowing and reaping." Uichirō treated Kikuyo as a disposable "common-law" wife, prioritizing his pride and a more "expensive" woman (Tsuyako). In the end, the woman he thought he was deceiving (Tsuyako) was the one deceiving him, while the woman he abandoned (Kikuyo) found happiness and stability.
*   **The Illusion of Control:** Uichirō prides himself on being "meticulous" and "clever," yet he is the most blind character in the story. He realizes too late that his "vanity" cost him everything.
*   **Post-War Masculinity in Crisis:** The protagonist is a man who has lost his "patriarchal" standing—he has no heir, no wife, and no home. His "defeat" by a woman (who was a "better actor") highlights a shift in power dynamics and the fragility of male ego.
*   **Irony of Domesticity:** The sewing machine represents Kikuyo's diligence and virtue. While Uichirō was chasing "geisha-like" vanity, Kikuyo was working hard, which eventually earned her the "reward" of a stable marriage with an influential man.
