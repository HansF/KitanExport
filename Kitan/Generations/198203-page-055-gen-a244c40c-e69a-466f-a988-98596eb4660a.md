この間、約一カ月ほどかかったが、週一、二回のセックスから考えれば、清美の順応性はそう悪いほうではないと思う。
私は清美に対して他の女よりも慎重になっていた。というのも、彼女が感受性の強い女だったからで、へたにＳＭプレイを始めて拒絶反応を起されては困ると考えたのである。
そこで、最初の縛りは例によってホテルの浴衣の紐を使い、両手を捻じあげるかわりに縛られることに慣れさせていった。
清美は、まるで強盗に犯されるみたいね、といったが、彼女の心境としてはその通りであったろう。その段階では、清美はまだＳＭプレイというものを知らなかったのである。私もまた〝強姦ごっこ〟と称して、なかば冗談めかしていた。
本格的な緊縛プレイを始めたの

は、やはりロープを使うようになってからで、清美は最初は驚いたようであったが、別に抵抗はしなかった。多分〝強姦ごっこ〟の延長ぐらいにしか考えていなかったのだろう。そういえば、私は清美に対して、ＳＭという言葉を一度も口にしたことがなかった。

    **人妻の味**

清美との緊縛プレイをするかたわら、私は別の女ともＳＭプレイに耽っていた。
その女は靖江といい三十三歳になる人妻で清美を知る一年前からのつきあいであった。

### 3️⃣ Literal English Translation

## Literal English Translation

During this time, it took about one month, but thinking about the once or twice a week sex, I think Kiyomi's adaptability is not that bad.
I was more cautious with Kiyomi than with other women. The reason being, because she was a woman of strong sensitivity, I thought it would be trouble if I started SM play poorly and caused a rejection reaction.
Therefore, for the first binding, I used—as per example—the sash of a hotel yukata, and instead of twisting up both hands, I got her accustomed to being bound.
Kiyomi said, "It's just like being violated by a robber," and as for her state of mind, that was probably exactly it. At that stage, Kiyomi did not yet know the thing called SM play. I also called it "Rape Pretend," making it half into a joke.
Starting authentic tight-binding [kinbaku] play...

[Image Gap]

...was, as expected, from when I started using rope; Kiyomi seemed surprised at first, but she did not particularly resist. She likely thought of it as nothing more than an extension of the "Rape Pretend." Come to think of it, I had never once uttered the word "SM" to Kiyomi.

**The Taste of a Married Woman**

While doing tight-binding play with Kiyomi, I was indulging in SM play with another woman as well.
That woman is called Yasue, a married woman turning thirty-three years old, and it was a relationship from one year before I knew Kiyomi.
Yasue [was] a department store...

## Literary English Translation

It took about a month, but considering we only had sex once or twice a week, I don't think Kiyomi's ability to adapt was poor at all.
I was far more cautious with Kiyomi than I had been with other women. She was highly sensitive, and I knew it would be problematic if I clumsily introduced SM play only to trigger a rejection reflex.
So, for our first session, I used the sash of a hotel yukata—as is customary—and rather than wrenching her arms up immediately, I simply got her used to the sensation of being tied.
"It feels just like being raped by a robber," Kiyomi remarked. In her mind, that is likely exactly what it was. At that stage, she had no concept of what "SM play" actually was. For my part, I framed it as a game—"Play-acting Rape"—keeping the tone half-joking.
The transition to authentic bondage...

[Image Gap]

...began when I switched to using actual rope. Kiyomi seemed surprised at first, but she offered no resistance. She likely viewed it merely as an escalation of our "rape games." Come to think of it, I never once mentioned the term "SM" to her.

**The Taste of a Married Woman**

While I was engaging in bondage play with Kiyomi, I was simultaneously indulging in SM with another woman.
Her name was Yasue, a thirty-three-year-old married woman whom I had been seeing for a year before I even met Kiyomi.
Yasue [was]... a department store...

### 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

```markdown
## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Genre:** *Jitsura* (True/Actual Record) or *Kannou Shosetsu* (Erotic Novel). It presents itself as a confessional memoir of a dominant male narrator.
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person, clinical, detached, and instructional. The narrator analyzes the psychology of his partners with a sense of expertise and manipulation.
*   **Layout:** Standard vertical columns (tategaki). The central placement of the photograph breaks the text flow, serving as a visual anchor for the "authentic bondage" mentioned in the text.
*   **Sectioning:**
    *   **Upper half:** Conclusion of the segment regarding the conditioning of "Kiyomi."
    *   **Lower left:** Start of a new segment titled "The Taste of a Married Woman" (人妻の味), introducing a new character, "Yasue."
*   **Target Audience:** Men interested in BDSM, specifically the psychology of domination and the "taming" of "ordinary" women.

### 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

```markdown
## Cultural & Historical Annotations

*   **Hotel Yukata Cords (ホテルの浴衣の紐):** A specific cultural trope in Japanese erotica and casual BDSM. In "Love Hotels" or hot spring inns (onsen), the thin sash (obi/himo) provided with the sleeping robe is often the most accessible tool for spontaneous bondage. It represents the entry-level or amateur stage before progressing to hemp rope.
*   **Gokan Gokko (強姦ごっこ - "Rape Game"):** A prevalent fantasy scenario in mid-20th-century Japanese erotica. In a socially conservative era where female sexual agency was often repressed, framing sex as "forced" (even playfully) allowed women in these narratives to abdicate responsibility for their pleasure, bypassing shame.
*   **"SM" (Esu-Emu):** In the 1950s/60s Japan, this term was becoming a loanword subculture signifier. The narrator's explicit refusal to use the word with Kiyomi highlights a distinction between the *act* (which she accepts under the guise of roleplay) and the *identity/label* (which carries stigma).
*   **Hitozuma (人妻 - Married Woman):** A major fetish category in Japanese pornography. It implies taboo, infidelity, and the corruption of a "respectable" domestic figure.

### 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes

```markdown
## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **順応性 (Jun'ousei):** "Adaptability." Used clinically here to describe how quickly the woman accepts the narrator's sexual preferences.
*   **拒絶反応 (Kyozetsu hannou):** "Rejection reaction" / "Immune rejection." A medical term borrowed here to describe psychological revulsion to kinks. It emphasizes the narrator's view of the woman as a subject to be managed.
*   **耽っていた (Fukette-ita):** "Indulged in" or "was absorbed in." Often used for vices or obsessions.
*   **緊縛 (Kinbaku):** "Tight binding." Specifically refers to the Japanese style of erotic rope bondage, distinguished here from mere "tying" (shibari).
*   **捻じあげる (Neji-ageru):** "To twist up." Implies a painful or forceful articulation of the limbs, common in police restraint or torture contexts, adopted into SM.

### 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

```markdown
## Themes & Subtext

*   **Grooming & Conditioning:** The text is a manual on how to ease a partner into BDSM without their full awareness. The narrator prides himself on his patience ("cautious," "took about a month") to avoid "rejection."
*   **Deception & Consent:** The narrator deliberately hides the nature of the act ("never once uttered the word SM"), framing it instead as a "robber" roleplay to make it palatable. This reflects a specific era's dynamic where male guidance/manipulation of female sexuality was romanticized.
*   **Clinical Detachment:** The narrator discusses the women's emotions ("surprise," "sensitivity") not with empathy, but as data points to calibrate his technique.
*   **The "Amateur" vs. The "Pro":** Kiyomi represents the innocent being corrupted; Yasue (the married woman) represents the experienced, illicit partner.
