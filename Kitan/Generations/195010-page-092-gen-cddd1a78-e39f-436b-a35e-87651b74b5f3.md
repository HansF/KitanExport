さんの無念はこの私がきつととつてやるから……。私一人で充分、皆騒くんぢやないよ。おとなしくまつてゐるの、判つたね――」
　じろりとしなめてから、小萬は如何なる成算あるのかきつぱりと言い切ると素早く身支度を整え始めた。いつの頃からか由井正雪の生き方に心酔して真似る様になつた薄物の黒羽二重に、菊水の紋散らしをさらりと身につけ、細身の刀をしんまり腰に打込むと、びんのほつれを撫で上げて、きおい立つ乾分を制して、すつと敷居を潜ぐ。カチ／＼ときよめ石の火花を背にして、行く先は、云わずと知れた不知火半左の許――。
　すらりとした容姿は黒二羽重の雪駄履きとマッチして、夕闇に惚れ／＼とする後姿のあでやかさ――。素足もなまめかしく道行く人を振返らせて、半刻の後、小萬は不知火と対座して、恐るゝ色もなく膝を揃えて血相かえた男共に取り囲まれていた。
「ホホ、女一匹を大の男が仰山に取り囲んで、逃げも隠れも致しませんよだれに何だい今の御挨拶は――。罪もない娘一人を散々手籠、蹴りものにしておいて、子分のやつたことはわしや知らぬと、それでも親分さんと奉られて乾分共の頭に納まつていられるのかね、それとも飽くまで知らぬ存ぜぬで押し通す気かね？」
「俺の知らぬ事だあな。だいい一女だてらにシャキ／＼とのさばり返つて惹向さげてくる料簡が、気に喰わないよ。足許の明るいうちに、トツトと歸りな――」
　不知火半左はせゝら笑つて、悠々妻に酌ませながら小鉢をつゝいてそつくり返つている。
「可哀相に嬲られた小さんは、それを苦にして佛になつたよ。半左さん、それでも当り前なんかね――。」
「小娘だてらに道頓堀で、男に櫂つくのを、チヨイト料理したのが何故悪い――。」
「女と男とどう違うんだね。――女だつて人間だよ。女なら死のうを、どうしようと勝手次第と云う掟はこの世間では通用するつてんのかい。この恥知らず、外道奴ッ！」
「フフ、女と男じやチット造作が違うんだだ。口惜しければホイこうして裸になつて見ろい――」
　不知火は憎々しげにパラリと單衣を脱ぎ捨てると、体一面不知火の刺青の肉をビチャ／＼平手で叩いてあざ笑つて見せた。
「………………」
「ハハどうだい。仲間交際いしたけりや、こうして裸になつて見ろい。裸一貫の賣り物、買い物。応と云や体を張る仁侠渡世なら裸が元金だ。口惜しけりゃ裸になつて見やがれッ。その上で一人と一人の挨拶もしようと云うもんさ。え――どうしたい……」
　暫し小萬はポッど頬を染めてじつと唇をかんでいた。出來ぬと知つての不知火の悪意地――。今更おめ／＼とも

「……さんの無念はこの私がきっととってやるから……。私一人で十分、皆騒ぐんじゃないよ。おとなしく待っているの、分かったね――」
　じろりとなめてから、小萬はいかなる成算があるのかきっぱりと言い切ると、素早く身支度を整え始めた。いつの頃からか由井正雪の生き方に心酔して真似るようになった薄物の黒羽二重に、菊水の紋散らしをさらりと身につけ、細身の刀をきゅっと腰に打ち込むと、びんのほつれを撫で上げて、いきおい立つ乾分（こぶん）を制して、すっと敷居を潜る。カチカチときよめ石の火花を背にして、行く先は、言わずと知れた不知火半左（しらぬい はんざ）の許（もと）――。
　すらりとした容姿は黒二羽重の雪駄（せった）履きとマッチして、夕闇に惚れ惚れとする後姿のあでやかさ――。素足もなまめかしく道行く人を振り返らせて、半刻の後、小萬は不知火と対座して、恐れる色もなく膝を揃えて、血相変えた男どもに取り囲まれていた。
「ホホ、女一匹を大の男が大層に取り囲んで、逃げも隠れもいたしませんよ。一体何だい、今の御挨拶は――。罪もない娘一人を散々手籠め、蹴りものにしておいて、子分のやったことはわしは知らぬと、それでも親分さんと奉られて乾分どもの頭に収まっていられるのかね。それともあくまで知らぬ存ぜぬで押し通す気かね？」
「俺の知らぬ事だ。第一、女だてらにシャキシャキとのさばり返って、喧嘩（いさか）を売ってくる料簡が、気に食わないよ。足元の明るいうちに、とっとと帰りな――」
　不知火半左はせせら笑って、悠々と妻に酌（しゃく）をさせながら小鉢をつついて反り返っている。
「可哀想に嬲（なぶ）られた小さんは、それを苦にして仏になったよ。半左さん、それでも当たり前なのかね――。」
「小娘だてらに道頓堀で、男に楯（たて）つくのを、ちょいと料理したのがなぜ悪い――。」
「女と男とどう違うんだね。――女だって人間だよ。女なら死のうが、どうしようが勝手次第という掟がこの世間では通用するっていうのかい。この恥知らず、外道奴（げどうめ）ッ！」
「フフ、女と男じゃちっと造作（ぞうさ）が違うんだ。悔しければ、ほい、こうして裸になってみろ――」
　不知火は憎々しげにパラリと単衣（ひとえ）を脱ぎ捨てると、体一面、不知火の刺青（いれずみ）の肉をビチャビチャ平手で叩いて嘲笑って見せた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"...[Someone]'s regret, this I certainly will take [revenge] for... Me alone is enough, everyone don't make a noise. Quietly be waiting, understood?"
After giving a sharp glance, Koman—whatever her plan—firmly spoke out and quickly began preparing her appearance. Having at some point become fascinated by and started imitating the lifestyle of Yui Shōsetsu, she lightly put on a thin black *habutae* silk garment with a scattered *kikusui* (chrysanthemum on water) crest, thrust a slender sword firmly into her waist, smoothed her stray hair, restrained her worked-up followers, and stepped through the threshold. With the "clack-clack" sparks of the purifying stone at her back, her destination was, needless to say, the place of Shiranui Hansa.
Her slender figure matched her black *settā* sandals; her back view in the dusk was captivatingly beautiful. Her bare feet were charming enough to make passersby turn around. Half an hour later, Koman sat facing Shiranui, showing no color of fear, knees together, surrounded by men whose faces had changed color [with rage].
"Ho ho, a crowd of big men surrounding a single woman—I won't run or hide. What on earth was that greeting just now? After dragging a guiltless girl through the dirt and kicking her around, can you still be worshipped as a 'Boss' and sit at the head of your followers saying 'I don't know what my subordinates did'? Or do you intend to push through to the end with 'I don't know, I didn't see'?"
"It's a matter I don't know. Firstly, for a woman, acting all sharp and bossy, coming here with such an attitude—I don't like it. While your feet are still bright [before it gets dark], hurry up and go home."
Shiranui Hansa sneered, leisurely having his wife pour him drinks while picking at a small bowl, leaning back arrogantly.
"Poor little O-san, who was trifled with, died from the pain of it. Hansa-san, is that still considered 'normal'?"
"A little girl at Dotonbori acting defiant toward men—what's wrong with 'cooking' her a little?"
"How are women and men different? Women are humans too! Is there a rule in this world that says if it's a woman, whether she dies or whatever happens is just as [one] pleases? You shameless brute!"
"Heh, the construction of women and men is a bit different. If you're frustrated, hey, try becoming naked like this—"
Shiranui hatefully cast off his single-layer robe, and slapped the flesh of his body, covered entirely in Shiranui tattoos, with a "splat-splat" sound, showing a mocking laugh.
"............"
"Haha, how about it? If you want to associate with us, try getting naked like this. Selling and buying with nothing but one's bare body. In the world of chivalry where you put your life on the line if you say 'Yes,' a naked body is the starting capital. If you're frustrated, try getting naked! After that, we'll have a man-to-man greeting. Well—what do you want to do...?"
For a moment, Koman's cheeks flushed red, and she bit her lip silently. It was Hansa's malice, knowing she couldn't do it. To now, shamefully...

"I will personally avenge the bitterness of his death," Koman declared. "I can handle this alone, so don't make a scene. Just wait here quietly. Do you understand?"
With a sharp, sweeping glance at her followers, Koman spoke with a conviction that suggested a hidden plan. She moved swiftly to dress. She had long admired the defiant spirit of the rebel Yui Shōsetsu and had taken to mimicking his style; she donned a sheer, black silk robe adorned with a scattered chrysanthemum-on-water motif. She thrust a slender blade into her sash, smoothed a few stray hairs at her temples, and, after checking her hot-headed men, stepped over the threshold. As she departed, the sparks from a flint-stone struck for luck flickered behind her. Her destination was certain: the lair of the notorious Shiranui Hansa.
Her lithe figure, paired with her black-strap sandals, cut an enchanting silhouette against the deepening twilight. The sight of her bare feet was enough to make any passerby stop and stare. An hour later, Koman sat composed before Shiranui, her knees tucked neatly beneath her. She showed not a flicker of fear, even as a gang of surly, red-faced thugs hemmed her in.
"My, my," she mocked. "A pack of grown men surrounding one lone woman. I'm not going to run or hide, so what's with the hostile welcome? You let your men kidnap and brutalize an innocent girl, and then you have the gall to claim you knew nothing about it? How can you call yourself a 'Boss' and lead these men? Or do you plan to play the 'see no evil, hear no evil' card until the very end?"
"I don't know what you're talking about," Hansa spat. "More to the point, I don't like your attitude—strutting in here like a man, acting all high and mighty. You'd better get lost while there's still enough light to see the road."
Hansa sneered, leaning back with arrogant ease as his wife poured him more sake.
"Poor O-san died of shame after what you did to her," Koman countered. "Hansa, do you really think that's acceptable?"
"A bratty girl at Dotonbori talking back to men? She needed to be taught a lesson. Why should I care?"
"How is a woman any different from a man? We are human beings! Does the law of this world say that a woman's life is yours to do with as you please? You shameless animal!"
"Heh. The 'plumbing' is a bit different, isn't it?" Hansa laughed. "If it burns you that much, then fine—show me what you've got. Strip down!"
With a sneer, Hansa shrugged off his robe, revealing a torso completely covered in intricate Shiranui-style tattoos. He slapped his tattooed flesh with a wet thud and laughed in her face.
"..."
"Well? If you want to play in our world, you have to show your skin. We trade on our bodies alone. In the world of the *yakuza*, your bare skin is your only currency. If you're so resentful, then let's see you strip. Only then will I treat you as an equal. Well? What's it going to be?"
Koman's cheeks flushed crimson. She bit her lip, trembling. She knew this was a calculated insult; he knew she couldn't possibly undress in front of them. To leave now would be a humiliation she couldn't endure...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a traditional Japanese vertical layout (*tate-gaki*), reading from top to bottom and right to left. 
*   **Typography:** The main text is set in a standard Mincho typeface. *Furigana* (small phonetic characters) are used extensively next to kanji to ensure the reader knows the correct pronunciation, which was common in popular "pulp" magazines of the era to increase accessibility.
*   **Illustration:** The center-bottom features a dynamic line drawing in the *ukiyo-e* or *moku-hanga* style. It depicts Shiranui Hansa (identifiable by his tattoos and arrogant posture) and Koman (the woman in the foreground). The style is reminiscent of pre-war and early post-war magazine illustrations for historical fiction.
*   **Structure:** The page number "( 92 )" is centered at the bottom. The text includes dialogue markers (brackets 「 」) and punctuation typical of mid-20th-century Japanese publishing.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** This text likely dates from the 1940s to the 1960s, a golden age for *Jidaigeki* (period drama) fiction in magazines. 
*   **Yui Shōsetsu (由井正雪):** Mentioned in the text, he was a real historical figure—a military strategist who led a failed coup against the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1651. In fiction, he is often portrayed as a symbol of rebellion and chivalry. Koman "imitating his lifestyle" suggests she is a "gender-bending" or "masculine" female lead (a *男勝り - otokomasari*).
*   **Irezumi (Tattoos):** Shiranui Hansa baring his tattoos is a classic trope in *yakuza* and *ninkyo* (chivalrous outlaw) literature. Tattoos represented one's resolve and status within the underworld.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The dialogue "Women are humans too!" (女だって人間だよ) reflects a more modern (post-Edo) sensibility regarding women's rights, even though the story is set in the Edo period. This tension between historical setting and modern social themes was common in mid-century fiction.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Kuro-mabane (黒羽二重):** A high-quality, plain-weave black silk, often used for formal or high-status garments.
*   **Kikusui (菊水):** A crest depicting a chrysanthemum floating on water. Historically associated with the loyalist hero Kusunoki Masashige.
*   **Settā (雪駄):** Traditional Japanese sandals with leather soles, often worn by stylish or "tough" characters.
*   **Dotonbori (道頓堀):** A famous theater and entertainment district in Osaka, often the setting for stories involving outlaws and performers.
*   **Ninkyo Tosei (仁侠渡世):** The "chivalrous world" or the life of an outlaw/yakuza. It implies a code of honor, however twisted.
*   **Gedō (外道):** Literally "outside the path" (a Buddhist term), used as a harsh insult meaning "brute," "fiend," or "heretic."

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Defiance and Chivalry:** Koman represents the *on-mago* or the chivalrous woman who stands up to male bullies. Her confrontation with Hansa is a clash of "honor" vs. "brute force."
*   **The "Body" as Currency:** Hansa’s challenge for Koman to strip highlights the sexualized power dynamics of the era's fiction. He uses nudity as a barrier to entry for the "male" world of the *yakuza*, betting on her "shame" as a woman to defeat her.
*   **Justice for the Weak:** The motivation for the scene is the death of "O-san," a victim of Hansa's gang. This sets up a classic revenge narrative (*katakiuchi* style).

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serialized Novel (Jidaigeki).
*   **Genre:** Period Drama, Action, Ninkyo (Chivalry).
*   **Tags:** Edo Period, Samurai/Outlaw culture, Gender Roles, Revenge, Tattoos, Pulp Fiction.
