## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

で美代はふり向いた。薄みどりのコートを着た中年の婦人が、金齒を光らせながら笑つていた。美代は、耳たぶまでまつ赤にして、おじぎした
「いつぞやは、有難うございました お茶でも飲みましよう。」
それは一週間ばかり前のことだつた。ちようど阪急の化粧品部で、咲きほこる西洋花のような化粧品に、うつとりとしていた美代が、ふとガラスの陳列台の上に、置き忘れられた黒皮のピカピカ光るハンドバツクを發見して、階段を降りかけていた、持主の婦人に手渡したことがあつたその婦人だつた。

さそわれるまゝに、美代は、婦人について行つた。ココアの甘い阪急前の或る喫茶店に入つた。
婦人は、ハンド、バツクから一枚の名刺と赤いペンシルを出した。
「小さな店ですが『ミト』とゆう喫茶店をやつているんです。ぜひ一度遊びに來て下さいね。學生さんたちが澤山きてくれますわ。」
そう言いながら、婦人は名刺を裏返しなから、地圖を書き出した。
「ここが淀屋橋、右へ約半丁、さらに右へやゝ小さい路ですが、二十米ばかり行つて、この路次を入るのです……。」
と説明しながら〇印をつけて『ミト』と書いた。すきとおるように白い細い指だつた。
「ぜひ、いらつしやいね。」
美代は、渡された名刺の表をかえして見た。喫茶『ミト』前川美穂子とあつた。
「わたしは美代と申します。美しい美に、年代の代。」
そういつて、白い齒を出して笑つた。
「一つ同じ字を持ちあつているんですね、何かの御縁でせう。」
美穂子も笑つた。憂愁をふくんだ長いまつげ、細く高い鼻、薄い上唇に特長的な美しさがあつたが、笑うと金齒に凄みがあつて、何かはげしい過去の生活をたたよわせていた。
「わたしは、上海でダンサーをしていたこともあるのよ。敗戰二年前、上海を引揚げてまいりました。上海

で、美代は振り向いた。薄緑のコートを着た中年の婦人が、金歯を光らせながら笑っていた。美代は、耳たぶまで真っ赤にして、お辞儀した。
「いつぞやは、ありがとうございました。お茶でも飲みましょう。」
それは一週間ばかり前のことだった。ちょうど阪急の化粧品部で、咲き誇る西洋花のような化粧品に、うっとりとしていた美代が、ふとガラスの陳列台の上に、置き忘れられた黒革のピカピカ光るハンドバッグを発見して、階段を降りかけていた、持ち主の婦人に手渡したことがあった、その婦人だった。

誘われるままに、美代は、婦人について行った。ココアの甘い阪急前の、ある喫茶店に入った。
婦人は、ハンドバッグから一枚の名刺と赤いペンシルを出した。
「小さな店ですが『ミト』という喫茶店をやっているんです。ぜひ一度遊びに来てくださいね。学生さんたちがたくさん来てくれますわ。」
そう言いながら、婦人は名刺を裏返しながら、地図を書き出した。
「ここが淀屋橋、右へ約半丁、さらに右へやや小さい路地ですが、二十メートルばかり行って、この路次を入るのです……。」

「わたしは美代と申します。美しいの『美』に、年代の『代』。」
そう言って、白い歯を出して笑った。
「一つ同じ字を持ち合っているんですね、何かのご縁でしょう。」
美穂子も笑った。憂愁を含んだ長いまつ毛、細く高い鼻、薄い上唇に特徴的な美しさがあったが、笑うと金歯に凄みがあって、何か激しい過去の生活を漂わせていた。
「わたしは、上海でダンサーをしていたこともあるのよ。敗戦二年前、上海を引揚げてまいりました。上海……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Then Miyo turned around. A middle-aged woman wearing a light green coat was smiling while making a gold tooth shine. Miyo, making [her face] bright red even to the earlobes, bowed.
"Some time ago, thank you very much. Let us drink tea or something."
That was a matter of about one week ago. Exactly at the Hankyu [Department Store] cosmetics department, Miyo, who was being enchanted by cosmetics like blooming Western flowers, suddenly discovered on a glass display stand a forgotten black leather shiny handbag, and to the owner woman who was about to go down the stairs, handed it over—it was that woman.

As if being invited, Miyo followed the woman. They entered a certain cafe in front of Hankyu where the cocoa was sweet.
The woman, from her handbag, took out one business card and a red pencil.
"It is a small shop, but I am running a cafe called 'Mito.' Please by all means come to visit once. Students come in large numbers."
While saying so, the woman, while turning the card over, began to write a map.
"Here is Yodoyabashi, to the right about half a block, further to the right it is a somewhat small road, but go about twenty meters, and enter this alley..."
Explaining thus, she put an 'O' mark and wrote 'Mito.' They were white, slender fingers as if transparent.
"Please, do come."
Miyo turned over the front of the handed card and looked. It said Cafe 'Mito,' Miho Maekawa.
"I am called Miyo. The 'Mi' of beautiful, and the 'Yo' of era."
Saying so, showing white teeth, she laughed.
"We share one same character, don't we? It must be some fate."
Miho also laughed. In the long eyelashes containing melancholy, the thin high nose, and the thin upper lip, there was a characteristic beauty, but when she laughed, there was an intensity in the gold tooth, and it drifted with the air of some intense past life.
"I have also done things like being a dancer in Shanghai. Two years before the defeat, I withdrew from Shanghai. Shanghai..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Miyo spun around. There stood a middle-aged woman in a pale green coat, her smile punctuated by the glint of a gold tooth. Blushing to the tips of her ears, Miyo offered a polite bow.
"Thank you again for the other day," the woman said. "Why don't we go for some tea?"
It had happened just a week ago. Miyo had been at the cosmetics counter of the Hankyu Department Store, daydreaming amidst the displays of makeup that looked like flowers in full bloom, when she spotted a shiny black leather handbag left on a glass showcase. She had hurried to catch the owner as she was heading down the stairs and returned it. This was that woman.

Following her lead, Miyo accompanied the woman to a cafe near the station, where the air smelled of sweet cocoa. 
The woman produced a business card and a red pencil from her bag.
"It’s just a little place, but I run a cafe called 'Mito.' You must come by sometime. We get a lot of students visiting."
As she spoke, she flipped the card over and began sketching a map.
"This is Yodoyabashi. Turn right for about half a block, then right again into a small street. Walk about twenty meters, and then you turn into this alleyway..."
She marked the spot with a circle and wrote the name 'Mito.' Her fingers were slender and so white they seemed almost translucent.
"Do come see us."
Miyo turned the card over. It read: *Cafe Mito – Miho Maekawa.*
"My name is Miyo," she said. "The 'Mi' for beauty and 'Yo' for generations." She smiled, her white teeth showing.
"We share a character in our names. It must be fate," Miho replied with a smile. There was a striking beauty in her melancholy lashes, her high, narrow nose, and her thin upper lip. Yet, when she laughed, that gold tooth lent her an air of fierce intensity, hinting at a turbulent past.
"I used to be a dancer in Shanghai," she added. "I fled the city and returned to Japan two years before the end of the war. Shanghai was..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page features a traditional vertical Japanese layout (*tate-gaki*), reading from top-to-bottom and right-to-left. 
*   **Illustration:** A line-drawing illustration occupies the center-top. It depicts three figures: a younger woman (Miyo) in profile looking at a display, an older man in a hat, and an older woman (presumably Miho). The style is characteristic of mid-century "story-telling" illustrations (*sashie*), focusing on fashion and expressive gestures.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of Kanji and Hiragana. It utilizes *kyū-kanjitai* (traditional Chinese characters used before the 1946 reforms) and *kyū-kanazukai* (historical kana usage, though some modernization is evident). Notable is the use of small punctuation marks and the repetition mark "ゝ".
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text flows around the illustration, suggesting a magazine format where text and art are integrated to evoke a specific mood (likely *shōjo* or *fujin* magazine style).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Hankyu Department Store (阪急):** A major landmark in Umeda, Osaka. It was (and is) a symbol of urban sophistication and "modern life" in the Kansai region.
*   **Shanghai and "Hikiage" (引揚げ):** The woman mentions being a dancer in Shanghai and "withdrawing" (*hikiage*) before the end of the war. Shanghai was a cosmopolitan hub where many Japanese lived during the colonial/war era. "Two years before the defeat" refers to 1943. Many Japanese who returned from these colonies (known as *hikiagesha*) brought with them a sense of "exotic" or "harrowing" pasts that were common themes in postwar literature.
*   **Gold Teeth (金歯):** In the early-to-mid 20th century, gold teeth were often a sign of some wealth but also associated with a certain "toughness" or a flashy, urban aesthetic, often linked to the nightlife or entertainment industry (like dancers).
*   **Yodoyabashi (淀屋橋):** A central business and transit district in Osaka, indicating the story's specific urban geography.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **いつぞや (Itsuzoya):** A somewhat formal or slightly dated way to say "the other day" or "some time ago."
*   **うっとり (Uttori):** To be spellbound, enchanted, or lost in a daydream. 
*   **凄み (Sugomi):** An intimidating air, intensity, or a "frightening" kind of beauty. Here, it contrasts with her "melancholy" (*yūshū*) features.
*   **引揚げ (Hikiage):** Specifically refers to the repatriation/evacuation of Japanese nationals from overseas territories after or during WWII.
*   **路次 (Roji):** An alley or narrow street.
*   **半丁 (Han-chō):** An old unit of distance/length. One *chō* is about 109 meters, so *han-chō* is roughly 50 meters.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Class and Aesthetics:** The contrast between the young, innocent student Miyo (admiring Western-style cosmetics) and the older, experienced Miho (with her gold tooth and Shanghai past) represents a transition between generations and worldviews.
*   **Post-war Identity:** The mention of Shanghai and the "defeat" (敗戦) grounds the story in the immediate postwar period. There is a subtext of trauma and survival—the "intense past life" written on Miho's face.
*   **Chance Encounters:** The "fate" (*en*) of having similar names is a common literary device in Japanese fiction to link two disparate characters.
*   **Modernization vs. Nostalgia:** The "Western flowers" (cosmetics) symbolize the desire for a new, glamorous life, while the gold tooth and Shanghai memories represent the gritty reality of the recent past.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
