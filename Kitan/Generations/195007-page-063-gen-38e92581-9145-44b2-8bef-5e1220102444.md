童貞を弄ぶ貴婦人
北川春男
明石三平 絵

一

「夕刊一部頂戴な」
黒つぽいコートに狐の襟巻、アツプヘアーのその女はどう見ても上流家庭の奥様だ。
女は、小脇に抱えた黒革のハンドバツクの留金をパチンと開けると、手の切れるような百円札を一枚取出して、「今こまかいのがないんだけど、これでとつて頂戴な」と言つて差し出した指に、ダイヤがきらりと光つた。
「お釣りがないんですけど」
芳太郎は当惑した。
その横で、妹の美津子が銭箱の小銭をかき集めていたが、まだそれだけも集つていなかつた。
「いいのよ、いいのよ。心配しなくたつて、お釣りはあんた達の御小使いになさいな」
「いえ、それはついけません」
だが、その時にはもう女は、人ごみの中へまじつて階段をのぼつていた。
此処は、地下鐵梅田構内。電車が、ブラツトホームに滑り込んで来る度に、どつと出札口からあふれ出てくる通勤帰りの人波で雑踏を極めている。
芳太郎は、見も知りもしないその客から、夕刊一部の代金に渡された百円札を手に持つたまま、狐にでもつままれたように、ぽんやり突っ立つていたが何思つたか、
「美津子、このお金返してくるよ」
「ウン、それがいいわ」
芳太郎は、ばたばたと馳け出した。
これが、そもそも芳太郎の運命を左右する発端であつたとは誰が知ろう。
階段を馳け昇つて、外へ出た
あたりには、すでに夕闇が垂れ込めめていた。女は、阪急百貨店の横を曲がる所だつた。
芳太郎は、人の波をかき分けて走つた。

二

「おばさん！」
芳太郎は、ふうふう息を切らしながら、女を呼びとめた。
「あら？」
女は、つと立ちどまると、くるつと振り返つた。
「おばさん、このお金返すよ。夕刊一部のお金位、今度ついで時何時でもいいんだよ」
「いいのよ、これはあんたに上げたのよ。」
「そんなことしてもらつたら、僕困るよ。折角こうして持つて来たんだから」
「そう、じや仕方がないわ。戴いとくわ。」
女は、そう言つて芳太郎から百円札を受取つてハンドバツクにしまうと、
「あんた、あたしが思つた通り感心な子ね。フフ……。そのかわり今から、何か御馳走してあげようかしら」
「いいよ、いそがしいから。」
「そんなこと言うもんじやないわ。さあ行きましょう」
女は、芳太郎の腕をとつて歩き出した。
芳太郎は、譯のわからないままに、女に引っ張られるようにして従つた。
大通りをそれて、裏通りに入つた。軒を競うようにぎつしり並んだ家々のあちこちから、耳をつんざくような男女のざわめきが聞え、すり切れたレコードが、かなり立てるジャズや流行歌が流れていた。
道路は、ネオンに反射して、青や赤とりどりの色彩に染まり、行き交う人々の影がゆらゆらとゆれている。
「さあ来ましたよ」
女は、芳太郎の手をとつて、青白いネオンの光で、〝ホテル・レインボ〟と形造られた家の玄関へ導き入れた。

「おかえりなさい」
いそいそと出て来た女中が、うす汚い芳太郎の方をちらつと見て丁寧に挨拶した
階段をのぼつて、突きあたりの右側の部屋へ入るとむつとするような暖かさだつた。
「おばさん、この部屋でずつと泊つてるの？、隨分立派な部屋だなぁ」
「そうよ。こゝに泊つてるのよ。でも、おばさんなんて言つちゃ駄目よ。あたしだつてまだ若いんだから。これからは、豊子おねえさんつて言うのよ。よくつて？」
「うん」
「所で坊やあいくつ？」
豊子は、じりじりと芳太郎にからだをすり寄せ、芳太郎のぷうつとふくれたつた頬を可愛いくてならないと云つて風に、いたずらつぽく人差指の先で突きつき、くすりと笑いながら言つた。
「十八だよ。坊やじやないよ。もう青年さ。芳太郎つて呼んでくれよ。」
「あら、怒るかつたわねえ、じや芳太郎

女は、小脇に抱えた黒革のハンドバッグの留金をパチンと開けると、手の切れるような百円札を一枚取り出して、「今細かいのがないんだけど、これでとって頂戴な」と言って差し出した指に、ダイヤがきらりと光った。

The Noblewoman Who Plays with Virginity
Haruo Kitagawa
Sanpei Akashi (Illustration)

1

"One copy of the evening paper, please."
Wearing a blackish coat with a fox stole and an up-style hairdo, that woman, no matter how one looked at her, was a lady from a high-class household.
The woman, when she clicked open the clasp of the black leather handbag held under her arm, took out one crisp-as-if-to-cut-the-hand 100-yen bill and said, "Right now I don't have small change, so take this, please," and on the finger she extended, a diamond sparkled brightly.
"I don't have change [for this large bill],"
Yoshitaro was perplexed.
Beside him, his younger sister Mitsuko was scraping together small coins from the money box, but they hadn't even gathered that much yet.
"It’s fine, it’s fine. Don't worry about it; take the change as pocket money for you all."
"No, that is not acceptable."
But, at that time already, the woman, mixing into the crowd, was climbing the stairs.
This is inside Umeda Subway Station. Every time a train slides into the platform, with a crowd of people returning from work overflowing from the ticket gate, it is reaching the height of congestion.
Yoshitaro, with the 100-yen bill given as payment for one copy of the evening paper by that customer he did not even know still held in his hand, stood there blankly as if bewitched by a fox, but thinking of something,
"Mitsuko, I’m going to go return this money."
"Yeah, that would be good."
Yoshitaro ran off with a pattering of feet.
Who would have known that this was, to begin with, the start that would sway Yoshitaro's fate?
Running up the stairs, he went outside.
In the vicinity, the evening darkness had already descended. The woman was just at the point of turning the corner by the Hankyu Department Store.
Yoshitaro ran, pushing through the wave of people.

2

"Ma'am!"
Yoshitaro, while huffing and puffing out of breath, called the woman to a stop.
"Oh?"
The woman, coming to a sudden stop, spun around.
"Ma'am, I'm returning this money. For the price of just one evening paper, any time when you're passing by would be fine."
"It's fine, I gave this to you."
"If you do that kind of thing, I'll be troubled. Since I've come all this way to bring it..."
"I see, then it can't be helped. I'll take it back."
The woman, saying so, received the 100-yen bill from Yoshitaro, put it in her handbag, and,
"You are, just as I thought, a commendable boy. Heh-heh... In exchange for that, from now, I wonder if I should treat you to something?"
"No thanks, because I'm busy."
"You shouldn't say such things. Now, let’s go."
The woman took Yoshitaro's arm and started walking.
Yoshitaro, without understanding why, followed as if being pulled by the woman.
Leaving the main street, they entered a back alley. From here and there among the houses packed together as if competing for eaves, the deafening clamor of men and women could be heard, and worn-out records were playing jazz and popular songs quite loudly.
The road, reflecting the neon, was dyed in various colors of blue and red, and the shadows of passing people were swaying tremulously.
"Now, we have arrived."
The woman took Yoshitaro’s hand and, by the light of a pale blue neon sign, led him into the entrance of a house shaped into the words "Hotel Rainbow."

"Welcome back."
A maid who came out briskly gave a quick glance at the grimy Yoshitaro and greeted politely.
Climbing the stairs and entering the room at the far end on the right side, there was a stuffy kind of warmth.
"Ma'am, are you staying in this room the whole time? It’s a very grand room, isn't it?"
"Yes. I’m staying here. But, you mustn't say things like 'Ma'am.' I’m still young, after all. From now on, call me Big Sister Toyoko. Is that okay?"
"Yeah."
"By the way, Sonny, how old are you?"
Toyoko, slowly sliding her body against Yoshitaro, as if his pouting, puffed-out cheeks were irresistibly cute, playfully poked him with the tip of her index finger and said while giggling,
"I'm eighteen. I'm not a 'sonny.' I'm already a young man. Call me Yoshitaro."
"Oh, you got angry, didn't you? Well then, Yoshitaro..."

**The Noblewoman Who Toyed with a Virgin**
By Haruo Kitagawa
Illustrated by Sanpei Akashi

I

"A copy of the evening edition, if you please."
With her dark coat, fox-fur stole, and elegant updo, the woman was the very picture of a lady from a high-class family. Opening her black leather handbag with a sharp *snap*, she produced a crisp, brand-new hundred-yen note. 
"I'm afraid I don't have anything smaller. Do take this," she said. As she extended her hand, a diamond on her finger caught the light and sparkled brilliantly.
"I—I don't have change for this," Yoshitaro stammered, bewildered. 
Beside him, his younger sister Mitsuko was frantically scrabbling through their coin box, but they didn't have anywhere near enough change.
"It’s quite all right. Don’t worry about it—keep the change as a little tip for the two of you."
"No, ma'am, I couldn't possibly..."
But the woman had already turned and disappeared into the crowd, ascending the stairs. 
This was the Umeda Subway Station. Every time a train pulled into the platform, a tidal wave of commuters flooded out of the ticket gates, turning the station into a swirling mass of humanity. Yoshitaro stood there dazed, as if bewitched, still clutching the hundred-yen note he'd been given for a single newspaper. Suddenly, he made up his mind.
"Mitsuko, I'm going to give this back to her."
"Yeah, you should," she agreed.
Yoshitaro took off running. Little did he know that this was the very moment his destiny would be forever altered.
He dashed up the stairs and out into the street. Twilight had already begun to fall. He spotted the woman just as she was turning the corner by the Hankyu Department Store and sprinted after her, weaving through the evening crowds.

II

"Ma'am!" Yoshitaro called out, panting for breath as he caught up to her.
"Oh?" The woman stopped abruptly and spun around.
"Ma'am, I have to return this. For just one paper... you can pay me whenever you’re passing by next."
"Nonsense, I gave it to you as a gift."
"I can't accept it, it wouldn't be right. Please, I ran all this way to give it back."
"I see. Well, if you insist, I suppose I'll take it," she said with a faint smile. She took the bill and tucked it back into her handbag. "You're a remarkably honest boy, aren't you? Heh... Tell me, would you like me to buy you a little treat in return?"
"No, thank you. I have to get back to work."
"Now, don't be like that. Come along."
She took him by the arm and began to walk. Before he knew what was happening, Yoshitaro found himself following her, led along as if by some invisible force. 
They turned off the main thoroughfare and into a back alley. The buildings here were huddled together, and from within came the raucous din of men and women's voices, mingling with the scratchy sounds of jazz and popular songs blaring from worn-out records. The street was bathed in the red and blue glow of neon signs, casting flickering shadows on the passersby.
"Here we are," the woman said.
Taking his hand, she led him through the entrance of a building adorned with a pale blue neon sign that read "Hotel Rainbow."

"Welcome back, Madam," a maid chirped as she hurried out. She gave the scruffy Yoshitaro a quick, curious glance before bowing politely. 
They climbed the stairs to a room at the very end of the hall. As they stepped inside, Yoshitaro was hit by a wave of stifling warmth.
"Ma'am, do you live here? It’s... it’s such a grand room."
"I do. I'm staying here for a while. But you mustn't call me 'Ma'am.' I'm not *that* old, you know. From now on, you must call me Big Sister Toyoko. Understood?"
"Yes... okay."
"So, little boy, how old are you?"
Toyoko slid closer to him, her body pressing against his. She reached out and playfully poked his puffed-out cheek with a finger, giggling softly.
"I'm eighteen!" Yoshitaro protested. "I'm not a 'little boy.' I'm a grown man. Call me Yoshitaro."
"Oh, did I hurt your pride? Well then, Yoshitaro..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure**: The text is arranged in a traditional vertical format (*tate-gaki*), read from right to left. It is divided into three main columns of text, with a large, stylized title running vertically on the far right.
*   **Typography**: 
    *   The **title** is written in a bold, calligraphic brush style to grab attention.
    *   **Section breaks** are indicated by Roman numerals ("一" and "二") centered at the top of the columns.
    *   **Punctuation**: The text uses traditional Japanese punctuation (commas, periods, quotation marks). Some older typographic conventions are present, such as small "tsu" (っ) and small "yo" (ょ) being used but occasionally rendered in ways that reflect mid-century printing technology.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The title "童貞を弄ぶ貴婦人" (The Noblewoman Who Plays with Virginity) is the most prominent element, followed by the author and illustrator names. This hierarchy is designed for a pulp/popular fiction magazine where the provocative title is the primary selling point.
*   **Pagination**: The number "-64-" at the bottom indicates the page number.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War 1950s)**: The story is set in the mid-1950s, a period of rapid recovery and social transition in Japan. The mention of the 100-yen note (a significant amount for a newsboy at the time) and the "Hotel Rainbow" suggests the "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine culture that flourished after the war.
*   **Setting (Umeda, Osaka)**: The Umeda Subway Station and Hankyu Department Store are major landmarks in Osaka. Even today, Umeda is a bustling hub, but in the 50s, it was the epicenter of urban modernization and contrasting social classes.
*   **Class Disparity**: The contrast between the "Kifujin" (noblewoman/rich lady) with her fox stole and diamonds and the "usuyogoreta" (grimy) newsboy highlights the sharp class divisions of the era.
*   **Hotel Culture**: "Hotel Rainbow" likely refers to a "Tsurekomi Yado" (short-stay hotel), the precursor to the modern Japanese love hotel. Taking a young newsboy to such a place was a scandalous and provocative trope in fiction of this time.
*   **Fox Stole (Kitsune no erimaki)**: A classic symbol of wealth and status for women in the Showa era. It often carried connotations of "fox-like" slyness or seduction in literary contexts.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **童貞 (Dōtei)**: Virgin (specifically male). In this context, it carries a heavy subtext of innocence and vulnerability being preyed upon.
*   **弄ぶ (Moteasobu)**: To play with, to toy with, or to trifle with. It implies a lack of sincerity and a power imbalance.
*   **貴婦人 (Kifujin)**: Noblewoman or high-class lady. A term often used ironically or to emphasize the "forbidden" nature of the cross-class encounter.
*   **銭箱 (Zenibako)**: A small wooden box used by street vendors to hold change.
*   **出札口 (Shussatsuguchi)**: Ticket gate/wicket. An older term for where tickets were checked.
*   **狐にでもつままれたよう (Kitsune ni demo tsumamareta yō)**: An idiom meaning "as if bewitched by a fox," used when someone is dazed or confused by something unbelievable.
*   **手の切れるような (Te no kireru yō na)**: Literally "so sharp it could cut the hand." Used to describe brand-new, crisp banknotes.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Seduction & Corruption**: The central theme is the seduction of an innocent, working-class youth by an older, wealthy woman. It plays on the "femme fatale" trope but adds a layer of class commentary.
*   **Urban Anonymity**: The Umeda station scene emphasizes the anonymity of the city, where two people from vastly different worlds can collide and disappear into the back alleys.
*   **Modernity vs. Poverty**: The bright neon lights, jazz music, and luxury hotels contrast with the boy's struggle to sell newspapers for a few yen.
*   **Masculinity & Age**: Yoshitaro’s insistence that he is eighteen and a "young man" (*seinen*) rather than a "boy" (*bōya*) reflects his desire for adult agency, which the woman manipulates by treating him with infantilizing affection.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type**: Fiction / Short Story (Pulp/Kasutori genre)
*   **Era**: 1950s (Showa Era)
*   **Setting**: Osaka (Umeda)
*   **Themes**: Seduction, Class Disparity, Urban Life, Coming of Age, Eroticism (Subtle/Period-specific)
*   **Characters**: Yoshitaro (Newsboy), Toyoko (Noblewoman), Mitsuko (Sister)
