## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

と訊ねると、老尼は悲痛な顔をして言つた。
「妾は、永年此處にこうしていた者ですが、恐らく愛慾の念の起つたことは、只の一度もありませんでした。それが、さつき、あなたか來られたのを見て、美しい男だなアとふと考えたのです。すると忽ちのうちに、元の姿に戾つてしまいました。
人の身はなんと、はかないものでしよう。これからは、今迄よりはもつと、永い修業をしなければ、もとの岩になれますまい」
と泣きながら言い終ると、そのまま山の奥さして入つて行つてしまつた。

**〔第五話〕**
**人妻に化けた狐**

今は昔、京に一人の卑賤な男があつた。晝頃用事が出来て大路へ出かけた妻は中々戾つて來なかつた。
日が暮れてもう暗くなりかけたので亭主はそろ〜心配になつてきた。
「一体どうしたのだろう、大分遅いが何か変つた事があつたのじやないかしら？」
と考えている所へ妻が戾つて來た。
「余り晩いのでどうしたのかと心配していた」
と聲をかけていると、今度は、姿と言い、聲と言い。顔形といい、少しも違わぬもう一人の女が入つて來たではないか。一時に二人の妻が出来たのだから、彼はすつかりびつくりしてしまつた。
併し、これは勿論考えるまでもなくどちらか一人が魔性のものに相違ないのである。
だがさて、どちらが本物の妻であるかということになると、迷わざるを得なかつた、横から見ても縦から見ても寸分違わないのである。彼は心を静めて二人の女を仔細に觀察した。
「そうだ」と彼は言つた。
「後から入つた奴こそ狐に違いない」
彼は直ちに刀を抜いて、後から入つてきた妻に走り寄つて斬ろうとすると、
「あなたは、何をなさいますのです。現在の妻を殺そうとなさるのですか」
と泣き聲をあげて責め立てるのて、次には前に入つてきた妻に走りかゝると、この方の女は又、手を合せて泣きわめくので、亭主はほと〜困り果てゝしまつた。
あちらかこちらかと迷いぬいた擧句、どうしても前に入つて来た女の方が怪しい気がしたので、その女を引つ捕えていると、不意に怪しいまでに、臭い屁をひりかけた。
鼻もまがるようなその臭さに思わず捕えていた手を離した隙に、忽ち狐の正体を現わして、開けたたまゝになつていた戸口から表通りへ飛び出して、こん〜と鳴きながら逃げて行つてしまつた。
男は地團駄ふんで口惜しがつたが、もうどうする事も出来なかつた。
考えてみると、これは正しくこの男の失敗であつた。何故、彼は最初から二人を縛つておかなかつたか。縛つておきさえすれば、むざ〜逃げられはしなかつたろうに、さても運のよい狐であつた。

**第六話**
**蛇と婚した女**

今は昔。河内國讃良の郡、馬の甘郷に住む者があつた。別に身分の尊いものでもなく下賤の姓ではあつたが、金をどつさり持つていた。
その家に一人の女の子があつた。四月の頃、養蠶の桑葉を採るために、大きな桑の木にのぼつていると、大きな蛇が出て來て、その女の登つている桑の木のもとに巻きついてしまつた。
その木は丁度道傍にあつたので、通りの人がそれを見付けて、その女に知らせた。驚いて見下すと、成程大きな蛇である。すつかり仰天して、あわてゝ木から飛び下りると蛇は忽ちからまりついて、これと嫁いでしまつたので、女は失神して木の下に臥してしまつた。
父母はこれを見て悲しみ直ちに醫師を招いた。それは名手の譽高い人であつたが、先づ女を家に連れ帰つて庭におくように命じ、更に稲藁三束を燒かせた。
次には湯に合せて汁三斗をとり、これを二升に煎じつめ猪の毛十把を汁に合せ、女の頭を下にして足を釣つてさげ、の汁を入れた。やがて一斗ばかり入れると、蛇はようやく離れて這つて逃げようとするのを、人々に打ち殺して棄てゝしまつた。
其の時、蛇の子がとつて蝦蟆の子の如く、猪の毛がそれに突きさゝつて、五升ばかり出たが、出終ると女は物心ついて物を言つたので父母が、
「どうだつた？」と訊ねると
「まるで夢を見ているようでした」と女は答えた。

と尋ねると、老尼は悲痛な顔をして言った。
「私は、永年ここにこうしていた者ですが、おそらく愛欲の念の起きたことは、ただの一度もありませんでした。それが、さっき、あなたが来られたのを見て、美しい男だなあとふと考えたのです。すると忽ちのうちに、元の姿に戻ってしまいました。
人の身はなんと、はかないものでしょう。これからは、今までよりはもっと、長い修行をしなければ、もとの岩になれますまい」

**〔第五話〕**
**人妻に化けた狐**

今は昔、京に一人の卑賤な男があった。昼頃用事ができて大路へ出かけた妻はなかなか戻って来なかった。
日が暮れてもう暗くなりかけたので、亭主はそろそろ心配になってきた。
「一体どうしたのだろう、だいぶ遅いが何か変わったことがあったのではないかしら？」
と考えているところへ妻が戻って来た。
「あまり遅いのでどうしたのかと心配していた」
と声をかけていると、今度は、姿と言い、声と言い、顔形と言い、少しも違わぬもう一人の女が入って来たではないか。一時に二人の妻ができたのだから、彼はすっかりびっくりしてしまった。
しかし、これはもちろん考えるまでもなくどちらか一人が魔性のものに相違ないのである。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(Ending of a previous story)... when asked, the old nun with a sorrowful face said:
"I am a person who was here for many years, but probably a thought of sexual desire occurring, not even once was there. That, just now, seeing you had come, 'a beautiful man,' I suddenly thought. Then, in an instant, I returned to my original form. How fleeting a human's body is. From now on, more than until now, unless I do long ascetic training, I will not be able to become the original rock."
While crying, finishing saying this, she went as is into the deep mountains and went away.

**[Fifth Story]**
**The Fox that Transformed into a Married Wife**

Now it is the past. In Kyoto, there was one lowly man. Around noon, a wife who went out to the main road for an errand did not easily return.
The sun set and it began to get dark, so the husband gradually became worried.
"What on earth happened, it is quite late, I wonder if something strange occurred?"
While he was thinking, the wife returned.
"Because it was very late, I was worried about what happened,"
while calling out, this time—in appearance, in voice, in facial features, not even a bit different—another woman entered, did she not? Since at one time two wives were created, he was completely surprised.
However, this, of course without even thinking, one of them without a doubt is a supernatural thing.
But well, regarding which is the real wife, he could not help but be lost. Whether looking from the side or looking from the length, there was not a hair's breadth of difference. He calmed his heart and observed the two women in detail.
"That's it," he said.
"The one who entered later must be the fox."
He immediately drew his sword, and when he ran toward the wife who came in later to slash her,
"You, what are you doing? Are you trying to kill your current wife?"
she raised a crying voice and reproached him, so next when he ran toward the wife who entered first, this woman again pressed her hands together and wailed, so the husband became utterly troubled.
As a result of agonizing over 'this one or that one,' because he felt the woman who came in first was suspicious after all, while he was seizing that woman, suddenly to a suspicious degree, she let out a stinking fart.
At that stench where even the nose would bend, in the gap of unintentionally letting go of the hand that was seizing her, she immediately revealed the fox's true form, jumped out to the main street from the doorway that remained open, and while crying "kon-kon," fled away.
The man stomped his feet and was vexed, but he could no longer do anything.
Thinking about it, this was truly this man's failure. Why did he not tie up the two from the beginning? If he had only tied them up, she would not have been able to flee so easily; indeed, it was a lucky fox.

**Sixth Story**
**The Woman Who Married a Snake**

Now it is the past. In Kawachi Province, Sanra District, Umagō, there was a person living. Not particularly of noble status, and of a lowly surname, but he had plenty of money.
In that house, there was one girl. Around April, to pick mulberry leaves for silkworm rearing, when she was climbing a large mulberry tree, a large snake came out and coiled itself around the base of the mulberry tree the woman was climbing.
Because that tree was exactly by the roadside, a passing person found it and informed the woman. Surprised and looking down, indeed it was a large snake. Completely terrified, when she hurriedly jumped down from the tree, the snake immediately coiled around her and mated with her, so the woman lost consciousness and lay down under the tree.
The parents saw this, grieved, and immediately invited a doctor. He was a person highly praised as a master, but first he ordered to take the girl back home and place her in the garden, and further had three bundles of rice straw burned.
Next, he took thirty liters of juice mixed with hot water, boiled it down to two liters, mixed ten bundles of wild boar hair into the juice, hung the woman upside down by the feet, and put the juice in [presumably into her body/orally]. Soon, when he put in about ten liters, the snake finally separated and tried to crawl away; the people beat it to death and threw it away.
At that time, snake children came out like toad children, and boar hair was stuck in them; about five liters came out, but when they finished coming out, the woman regained consciousness and spoke, so the parents asked,
"How was it?"
"It was just like I was having a dream," the woman replied.
(The End)

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

...the old nun replied with a look of profound grief. "I have lived here for many years, and in all that time, not once did I harbor a single carnal desire. Yet just now, when I saw you arrive, the thought crossed my mind: 'What a handsome man.' In that instant, I reverted to this human form. How fragile and fleeting is the human condition! I must now undergo even longer and more rigorous ascetic training than before if I am ever to return to my original state as a rock." With these words, she vanished into the depths of the mountains, weeping all the while.

**[Fifth Story]**
**The Fox that Mimicked a Wife**

Long ago, there lived a man of humble means in Kyoto. One day around noon, his wife went out to the main thoroughfare on an errand and failed to return. As the sun dipped below the horizon and the world grew dark, the husband became increasingly anxious.
"What could have happened to her? She is so late; I hope nothing has gone wrong," he fretted. Just then, his wife walked through the door. 
"I was so worried because you were gone so long!" he exclaimed. But as he spoke, another woman entered the house—identical in appearance, voice, and features. He was struck dumb with shock at the sight of two identical wives.
Naturally, he knew that one of them had to be a supernatural creature in disguise. Yet, he was at a total loss as to which was his true wife. From every angle, they were indistinguishable. Calming his nerves, he observed them closely.
"I have it!" he shouted. "The one who came in second must be the fox!"
He drew his sword and lunged at the second wife. But she wailed, "What are you doing? Are you trying to murder your own wife?" 
Confused, he turned his blade toward the first wife, but she too fell to her knees, weeping and pleading for mercy. The husband was utterly paralyzed by indecision.
After agonizing between the two, he finally decided that the first woman seemed more suspicious. But as he grabbed her, she suddenly released a foul, overpowering fart. The stench was so revolting it made his head spin, and in the moment he reflexively let go, the creature revealed its true form—a fox. It bolted through the open door, yelping "kon-kon" as it disappeared down the street.
The man stamped his feet in frustration, but there was nothing to be done. Looking back, he realized his mistake: he should have tied both of them up from the start. Had he done so, the creature wouldn't have escaped so easily. It was, indeed, a very lucky fox.

**Sixth Story**
**The Woman Who Wed a Snake**

Long ago, in the village of Umagō in the Sanra District of Kawachi Province, there lived a man. Though he was of low birth, he had amassed a great fortune. 
He had a daughter. One April, while she was high up in a large mulberry tree gathering leaves for their silkworms, a massive snake appeared and coiled itself around the base of the trunk. 
As the tree stood right by the road, a passerby noticed the snake and shouted a warning to the girl. Looking down in terror, she saw the enormous serpent. Panicked, she leaped from the tree, only for the snake to instantly entwine itself around her and "wed" her. The girl collapsed and lost consciousness.
Her grieving parents summoned a renowned physician. The master doctor ordered the girl to be brought to the garden and instructed the parents to burn three bundles of rice straw. He then prepared a medicinal concoction of thirty liters of liquid boiled down to two, mixed with bundles of wild boar hair. He hung the girl upside down by her feet and administered the liquid. After about ten liters, the snake finally detached itself and tried to slither away, but the villagers beat it to death.
Small snake-offspring, looking like tiny toads and bristling with boar hair, were purged from her body—nearly nine liters in total. Once the ordeal was over, the girl regained her senses. When her parents asked how she felt, she simply replied, "It was as if I were trapped in a dream."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The text is arranged in traditional vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). It uses a standard Mincho typeface common in mid-century printing. 
*   **Structure:** The page contains the conclusion of a story, followed by two numbered stories (Fifth and Sixth). Titles are set in bold with decorative brackets for the fifth story.
*   **Visual Elements:** A central illustration divides the stories. It is an ink-style drawing depicting the climax of the "Fox" story, showing the husband threatening the two identical wives. The style is reminiscent of pre-war *e-hon* (illustrated books) but adapted for a magazine format.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses modern punctuation (periods, commas, quotation marks) but retains some older orthographic markers like the repetition mark (*odoriji* ゝ and ゞ).
*   **Hierarchy:** The story titles are prominent, and the use of "今は昔" (Ima wa mukashi) serves as a stylistic marker for the start of folk tales.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** The orthography (a mix of *kyū-kanji* like 處, 廣 and modern *kana* usage) suggests the late 1940s to early 1960s. This was a period when classical tales were frequently repackaged for children and general entertainment in magazines.
*   **"Ima wa Mukashi" (Now it is the past):** This is the iconic opening phrase of the *Konjaku Monogatarishū* (late Heian period). Using it immediately signals to the reader that these are "classic" or "ancient" stories.
*   **Fox Lore (Kitsune):** Japanese folklore is rich with stories of foxes transforming into beautiful women to trick humans. The ending of the fifth story, where the fox farts to escape, is a common "low comedy" element in *setsuwa* literature, serving to humiliate the supernatural creature even as it escapes.
*   **Snake Lore:** Snakes (*hebi*) in Japanese folklore often represent deities (*kami*) or lustful spirits. Marriage between a human and a snake usually ends in tragedy or a miraculous medical cure, as seen here.
*   **Medicine & Ritual:** The cure in the sixth story—hanging the woman upside down and using "wild boar hair"—reflects folk medicine beliefs where certain animal parts or extreme physical positions were thought to expel possessing spirits or parasites.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **卑賤 (Hisen):** Lowly, humble, of low social rank. 
*   **亭主 (Teishu):** Husband; also refers to the master of a house.
*   **魔性のもの (Mashō no mono):** A diabolical or supernatural being; something with the power to bewitch.
*   **地團駄 (Jidanda):** Stamping one's feet in frustration (usually as *jidanda wo fumu*).
*   **むざむざ (Muza-muza):** Helplessly, easily, without resistance.
*   **仰天 (Gyōten):** To be utterly amazed or horrified (astounded).
*   **物心つく (Monogokoro-tsuku):** To regain consciousness or come to one's senses.
*   **斗 (To) / 升 (Shō):** Traditional units of volume. 1 *shō* is approx. 1.8 liters; 1 *to* is 10 *shō* (approx. 18 liters).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Identity and Illusion:** The fox story deals with the fragility of identity and the difficulty of discerning truth from a perfect imitation.
*   **Supernatural Intrusion:** Both stories portray the domestic space being invaded by the "outside" or the "wild" (fox and snake), which must be expelled to restore order.
*   **Gender and Vulnerability:** Women are depicted as the primary targets of supernatural transformation or possession. In the fox story, the wife's identity is stolen; in the snake story, the girl is physically violated by a serpent.
*   **The Power of Observation vs. Instinct:** The husband in the fox story fails because he relies on logic/observation rather than immediate action (tying them both up), whereas the fox relies on a base instinct (the fart) to escape.
*   **Purification:** The snake story is essentially a "cleansing" narrative, where a foreign, impure presence (the snake and its offspring) is purged from the human body through a pseudo-medical ritual.
