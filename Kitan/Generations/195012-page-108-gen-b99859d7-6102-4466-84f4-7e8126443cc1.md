## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

のである。短い毛をひきつめて後でくくり、おまんじゅうをちょんととのせているが、いまにも落ちそうにぶら〜としている。
「ヒヒヒヒ、はづかしい」
そういつて、シナをつくって椅子にかけた。どっさり口紅を塗った厚ぼったい唇から出歯がのぞいているのが可愛いらしい。
「奥さん、どうして、こんなところへきたんですい？」
「あたし、決心したのよ、夫に会いたくって——きっと地下室にいると思うわ、あなた方もそのためにきて下さったんでしょう？」
「そうですよ、ぢゃ、ちょうどいいやバンドが始まったら一緒に行きやしゃ。カマキリの奴、もう切符手に入れやしたが、ひとり三十圓、たまげたね、」
「ぢゃー、あたしもお願いできるかしら」
「いいです、いくらでも売ってくれますから」
やがてノーナマニス（可愛い娘さん）の軽快な旋律が流れ出した。
客達は雑談をやめて立上り、浮々した様子でステップを踏み始めた。
三人はそ〜とバンドの後を通り抜けて奥の方のドアの前に立っているボーイの傍までゆくと先頭のカマキリが切符を示した。ボーイは丁寧に腰を曲げて一礼しながらドアを開けた。三人は足も地につかぬ恰好で中へ飛びこんだ。バタンとドアが閉った。薄暗いランプの下で互いに顔を見交して、にやりとした。

狭い廊下を曲って十米ほどゆくと石段が地下に伸びていた。そろ〜降りてゆくと石油ランプがちらちらしている所に荒けずりのドアがボンヤリみえた。至極頑丈に出来ている。ギギイと押し開けて、そおっと中を覗いてみると、驚いた。
百坪ぐらいの部屋に小さな舞台が設けてあり、その天井の明るいガス燈の下で、いま、二人の男女が特殊な舞踊をやっている。全裸ではない。が出すべきところはチャンと出しているのがみものである。
薄暗い客席には、性の異なる人間共が一組づつ密室の若夫婦の恰好でみている。
たしかに三十円のネウチはある。と思ってカンボテは、あんぐり開いた口の端っこからだら〜とよだれを垂らした。
ひと目みるなりシャツキコラになってしまったカマキリは、微妙に膝を振動させて、カンボテのお尻にすがりついて躰の平衡を保つのに苦労している。
マリアームは、ソピ（椰子酒）を一杯がぶとのみほしてきたみたいな顔をして、シッカリ手を握りしめて呼吸困難に陥入りつつあった。
「ねえ——ニョオニャー（奥さん）」
暗がりから、くねくね腰を振りながら、いやらしい男が現れて、女装のカンボテに、蜘蛛の巣みたいにからみついた。
「ぶる〜ツ」
カンボテは顎を上下に躍動させて飛び除いた。次に水瓜の化物みたいな大きな唇をしたオナゴがゆうと現れてカマキリにしなだれかかった。
「エヘヘヘ」
カマキリは、トタンに糸ゴンニャクになってボーとしてしまった。
「これッ」
カンボテが、ギョロリと眼を剥いてカマキリの横っ腹をプリッと抓った。カマキリは足の裏にヤイトをすえられたみたいに跳ね上った。
「馬鹿奴、奥さんを守れ」
「アレレッ」
今度は、マリアームが男にからみつかれて、ストリップショウみたいに尻を振って暴れている。カマキリが男の脇の下をこそぐって追いやり、マリアームと手に手をとって客席へしけこんだ。
追いやられたいやらしい男は、舌打ちして、また、カンボテにしなだれかかった。が、カンボテは、既に女の手を掴んで胸に抱きしめて踊っていた。
舞台はいまや最高潮で、客席のあちこちで溜息（ためいき）やら鼻息が手にとるように聞こえる。
カマキリは、マリアームにしがみついて脇の下からタラ〜油汗を流し、眼を閉じたり、汗を拭いたりしてこらえている。
カンボテは、女を膝に抱きあげ、舞台の方を向いて鼻の穴から蒸気ポンプのような勢いで息を吐きながら、思わず女のお乳を、ぎゅっと握りしめてしまった。が、女はケロリとしている。カンボテはおや？と思った。職業意識に湧然と頭をかけめぐった。舞台も一時目に入らなかった。
やがて、ハッと何かに思い当ったらしく、眼玉をくるりと一廻転させると女を椅子の上へおっぽり出し、あわてふためいてカマキリの方へ飛んでいつた。
「引揚げろッ！」
低く喘いだ。ふら〜になっていたカマキリの細腕をぐい〜引っ張って外に出た。マリアームもョロ〜しながら出てきた。
「ど、どうしたんだよ、せっかくいいところなのに——」
カマキリはぶる〜いっている。
「馬鹿野郎ツ、目星がついたんだッ、さゝ奥さんも大急ぎだッ」
はやカンボテは、くるつとサロンをまくって十三文の足で石段を勢いよく駆け上っていた。

カンボテが凄い見幕でどこへ行くかと思ったら警察署へ逆戻りしてしまった。
「ポリシー、留置場を開けろッ」
女の気狂いが駆けこんだと思った当直のポリシーは、ひゃあと椅子から机の上まで飛び上つて
「コラッ、出ていけ〜ッ」
「な、なにッ？早くしろッ！俺はボリシーカンボテだぞッ」
「うへえツ、そ、そりゃ」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

...it is. Short hair pulled tight and tied in back, a bun "chon" placed there, but even now as if to fall, it is "bura-bura" dangling.
"Hee-hee-hee-hee, embarrassing."
Saying so, making a "shina" (flirtatious pose), [she] sat on the chair. From the thick lips painted with a lot of lipstick, the buckteeth peeping out are cute.
"Madam, why, did [you] come to such a place?"
"I, decided. To meet my husband—surely I think he is in the basement. You all came for that too, didn't you?"
"That's right. Well, just right. When the band starts, let's go together. That Kamakiri fellow, already got the tickets, but 30 yen per person, it was a surprise."
"Then, can I ask [you] too?"
"It's fine, they sell as many as you want."
Before long, the light melody of "Nona Manis" (Sweet Girl) began to flow.
The guests stopped chatting and stood up, in a floating manner started to step.
The three "so-tto" (quietly) passed behind the band, went to the side of the boy standing in front of the back door, and Kamakiri at the head showed the ticket. The boy politely bent his waist, bowed, and opened the door. The three jumped inside in a manner as if their feet didn't touch the ground. "Batan" the door closed. Under the dim lamp, they looked at each other's faces and grinned.

Turning a narrow corridor and going about ten meters, stone steps stretched into the basement. Descending "soro-soro" (slowly), at a place where oil lamps flickered, a rough-hewn door could be vaguely seen. It was made extremely sturdy. "Gigi-i" pushing it open, and peeking inside "soo-tto" (quietly), [they] were surprised.
In a room of about 100 tsubo, a small stage was set up, and under the bright gas light of that ceiling, now, two people, male and female, were doing a special dance. Not completely naked. But the parts that should be out are "chan-to" (properly) out, which is the sight to see.
In the dim audience seats, humans of different sexes, one pair each, are watching in the manner of a young couple in a secret room.
"Certainly it is worth 30 yen," thinking so, Cambote, from the corner of his mouth opened "anguri" (wide), "dara-a" (drool) dripped.
Kamakiri, who became "shakkiri" (excited/tense) the moment he saw it, delicately vibrating his knees, clung to Cambote's buttocks and struggled to keep the body's balance.
Mariam, looking like she had gulped down a glass of Sopi (palm wine), was falling into difficulty breathing while firmly clutching hands.
"Hey—Nyonya (Madam)."
From the darkness, while "kune-kune" (wriggling) hips, a disgusting man appeared, and to the cross-dressing Cambote, entangled like a spiderweb.
"Buru-tsu" (Shudder).
Cambote jumped away, making his jaw leap up and down. Next, a woman with large lips like a watermelon monster "yuu-to" (slowly) appeared and leaned against Kamakiri.
"Ehehehe."
Kamakiri, instantly became like "ito-konnyaku" (thread konjac/limp) and became "bo-tto" (dazed).
"This!"
Cambote, rolling his eyes wide, "puri-tto" (sharply) pinched Kamakiri's side. Kamakiri leaped up as if "yaito" (moxibustion burn) was placed on the sole of his foot.
"You fool, protect the Madam."
"Arere-tsu."
This time, Mariam was entangled by a man, and like a strip show, shaking her buttocks, was acting wildly. Kamakiri tickled the man's armpit and sent him away, and taking Mariam hand-in-hand, sneaked into the audience seats.
The disgusting man who was sent away clicked his tongue and again leaned against Cambote. But Cambote was already grabbing a woman's hand and dancing, holding her to his chest.
The stage was now at its peak, and in various parts of the audience, sighs and snorting could be heard as if to be grasped by hand.
Kamakiri, clinging to Mariam, from his armpits "tara-a" (dripping) oil-sweat flowed, closing his eyes, wiping sweat, enduring.
Cambote, lifting the woman onto his lap, facing the stage, while breathing out from his nostrils with the force of a steam pump, unintentionally, the woman's breast, "gyu-tto" (tightly) grabbed. But, the woman was "kerori" (nonchalant). Cambote thought "Oh?" Professional consciousness surged through his head. For a moment, even the stage did not enter his eyes.
Before long, "Ha-tto" (Suddenly) as if hitting upon something, rotating his eyeballs once, he threw the woman onto a chair, and in a fluster flew toward Kamakiri.
"Withdraw!"
He panted lowly. He pulled the thin arm of Kamakiri, who had become "fura-a" (dizzy), and went outside. Mariam also came out while "yoro-yoro" (staggering).
"Wh-what happened, even though it was a good part—"
Kamakiri is saying "buru-a" (shivering).
"You idiot, I've got a lead. Come, Madam, in a great hurry!"
Already Cambote, wrapping his sarong "kuru-tto" (around), with his 13-mon feet, was vigorously running up the stone steps.

V

When [one] thought where Cambote was going with such a fierce countenance, he went back to the police station.
"Polisi (Police), open the detention cell!"
The duty Polisi, thinking a female madman had rushed in, "hya-a" jumped from the chair onto the desk.
"Hey, get out!"
"Wh-what? Hurry up! I am Polisi Cambote!"
"Uhee, th-that is..."
The duty Polisi like a Shamo (gamecock) "bata-a" (flapping) jumped down from the desk, and in a great hurry opened the detention cell. Inside, the woman of Cafe "Bintang Malam" (Night Star) suspected of murder, alone, "dero-tto" (limply) was crouching.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

...she wore her short hair pulled tight into a bun at the back, though it wobbled precariously as if it might tumble off at any moment.
"Tee-hee, how embarrassing," she said, striking a flirtatious pose as she took a seat. Her thick, heavily rouged lips parted to reveal a set of buckteeth—a sight that was oddly charming.
"Madam, what brings you to a place like this?"
"I’ve made up my mind. I want to see my husband—I’m certain he’s being held in the basement. I assume that’s why you’re here as well?"
"Precisely. Well, the timing is perfect; we'll head down together once the band starts. That fellow Kamakiri already managed to score some tickets, though thirty yen a head is a bit of a shock, isn't it?"
"In that case, could I trouble you to take me along?"
"Of course, they'll sell to anyone with the coin."
Presently, the jaunty strains of "Nona Manis" began to drift through the air. The patrons ceased their chatter and rose, beginning to step to the music with an air of buoyant excitement. The three companions slipped quietly behind the band toward a door at the rear. When they reached the waiter standing guard, Kamakiri, leading the way, flashed the tickets. The waiter offered a polite bow and held the door open. The three practically flew inside, their feet hardly touching the floor. The door shut with a dull thud. In the amber glow of a dim lamp, they caught each other’s eyes and grinned.

They rounded a narrow corridor and walked about ten meters to find a flight of stone steps descending into the earth. Creeping down, they spotted a crudely fashioned, heavy door flickering in the light of an oil lamp. It looked incredibly sturdy. They pried it open with a low creak and peered inside—it was a sight to behold.
In a room roughly three hundred square meters, a small stage had been erected. Beneath the brilliant gaslights of the ceiling, a man and a woman were engaged in a... "special" sort of dance. They weren't entirely nude, but they certainly left little to the imagination. In the darkened stalls, pairs of men and women watched on, huddled together like newlyweds in a private chamber.
"Definitely worth the thirty yen," Cambote thought, a string of drool leaking from the corner of his wide-open mouth.
Kamakiri had gone stiff as a board the moment he laid eyes on the scene. His knees were knocking so violently he had to cling to Cambote’s backside just to keep his balance. Mariam looked as though she’d just downed a whole bottle of sopi; she was clutching her hands tight, practically gasping for air.
"Hello there—Nyonya," a voice called out.
A repulsive-looking man emerged from the shadows, swaying his hips as he entangled himself around the cross-dressed Cambote like a spider's web. Cambote shuddered, his jaw working up and down as he recoiled. Next, a woman with lips as huge as watermelons loomed over Kamakiri, leaning into him.
"Heh-heh-heh..."
Kamakiri instantly turned to jelly, his mind going blank.
"Snap out of it!" Cambote barked, rolling his eyes and giving Kamakiri’s ribs a sharp pinch. Kamakiri leapt as if he’d been branded with a hot iron. "You idiot, protect the Madam!"
"Whoa!"
Now it was Mariam’s turn to be accosted. A man grabbed her, and she started thrashing about, shaking her hips like a burlesque dancer. Kamakiri drove the man off by tickling his armpits, then grabbed Mariam’s hand and ducked into the audience.
The rebuffed man spat a curse and tried his luck with Cambote again, but Cambote had already seized another woman’s hand and was dancing with her pressed to his chest. The performance on stage reached its fever pitch; the air in the room was thick with the sound of heavy breathing and stifled sighs.
Kamakiri clung to Mariam, grease-sweat pouring from his pits. He squeezed his eyes shut and wiped his brow, trying to endure the spectacle. Cambote, meanwhile, had hoisted the woman he was dancing with onto his lap. Breathing like a steam engine, he instinctively gave her breast a firm squeeze. To his surprise, she didn't even flinch. *That's odd,* he thought. His investigator’s intuition suddenly flared to life. The stage show vanished from his mind.
A realization struck him like a bolt of lightning. His eyes darted around; he shoved the woman off his lap and scrambled over to Kamakiri.
"We’re leaving!" he hissed.
He grabbed the dazed Kamakiri by his spindly arm and hauled him out. Mariam followed, stumbling in their wake.
"Wh-what’s the big idea? It was just getting to the good part..." Kamakiri stammered, still shivering.
"Shut it! I found what I was looking for. Come on, Madam, we have to move!"
Cambote had already hiked up his sarong and was charging up the stone steps with surprising speed.

V

One might have wondered where Cambote was heading with such a ferocious look on his face, but he made a beeline straight back to the police station.
"Officer! Open the cells!"
The officer on duty, convinced a madwoman had just stormed the building, yelped and leapt from his chair onto his desk. "Hey! Get out of here!"
"What was that? Move it! It's me, Officer Cambote!"
"Gah! I—Is it really you?"
The duty officer hopped down from the desk like a startled rooster and hurried to unlock the cells. Inside, there was only one person: the woman from the Cafe Bintang Malam, a murder suspect, huddled in a heap on the floor.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** This is a standard single-page layout from a Japanese literary magazine or pocketbook. The text is arranged in vertical columns (tategaki), read from top to bottom and right to left.
*   **Typography:** The typeface is a traditional Mincho style typical of mid-century Japanese printing. The kanji are a mix of modern forms and some older variants (Kyujitai), though it leans toward the post-war simplified standard.
*   **Visual Markers:**
    *   **Section Break:** A large numeral "五" (5) indicates a chapter or scene break.
    *   **Punctuation:** Frequent use of the wave dash (`〜`) and small `ッ` to indicate prolonged or clipped speech, emphasizing a colloquial, dramatic, or excited tone.
    *   **Furigana:** Small phonetic guides (rubi) are used for difficult kanji or foreign loanwords (e.g., 溜息/ためいき, 椰子酒/ソピ).
    *   **Pagination:** The number `(109)` is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is part of a longer work.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The linguistic style and the setting suggest the era of "Nan'yō" (South Seas) adventure fiction. This genre was popular in Japan both during the imperial expansion and in the immediate post-war period, often featuring Japanese characters in Southeast Asian colonial settings.
*   **Southeast Asian Influence:**
    *   **Nona Manis:** Refers to the Indonesian/Malay folk song "Nona Manis Siapa Yang Punya."
    *   **Nyonya:** A term for a married woman, often used in the Peranakan (Straits Chinese) context or generally in the Malay Archipelago.
    *   **Sopi:** A traditional Indonesian palm liquor.
    *   **Sarong:** Mentioned as a "salon" (サロン), the traditional wrap-around garment.
    *   **Bintang Malam:** "Night Star" in Indonesian/Malay, a common name for cafes or clubs.
*   **Gender and Cross-dressing:** The character Cambote is referred to as "女装のカンボテ" (Cambote in women's clothing). This suggests a plot point involving disguise or a comedic/subversive character archetype common in pulp fiction.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Kamakiri (カマキリ):** Literally "Praying Mantis." In this context, it is a nickname for a thin, spindly character.
*   **Cambote (カンボテ):** A name likely derived from "Kamboja" (Cambodian) or simply an exotic-sounding pseudonym for the protagonist.
*   **Polisi (ポリシー/ボリシー):** The Japanese phonetic rendering of "Police" as used in the Malay/Indonesian region (*Polisi*).
*   **Yait (ヤイト):** An older term for *okyu* (moxibustion). To "have yaito set" means to be burned/punished or startled by a sharp pain.
*   **13-mon (十三文):** An old measurement for foot size (approx. 31cm), implying Cambote has very large feet, often used as a comedic trope.
*   **Shana (シナ/嬌態):** Flirtatious behavior or "coquettishness."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Exotic and the Grotesque:** The text blends "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense) elements common in pre-and-post-war Japanese pulp. The description of the "watermelon-lipped monster" and the "special dance" emphasizes a fascination with the seedy underbelly of exotic locales.
*   **Identity and Disguise:** The protagonist, a police officer, is undercover in women's clothing. This highlights themes of infiltration and the blurring of social boundaries.
*   **Hard-boiled Detective Tropes:** Despite the comedic elements, the sudden "professional intuition" and the rush back to the station follow the beats of a detective thriller. The contrast between the "low" entertainment of the club and the "high" stakes of a murder investigation is a classic noir technique.
