く上ると、女が敷いた煎餅布団に黙つて横たはつた。感情をおき忘れた平たい顔の女が、今ふりかけた許りの百圓香水のどぎつい匂いを辺りに撒き散してコロリと傍らに轉がると、さあ好きな様にしなはれと云はん素振り——。
おづ〜手を出して、やうやこの女は金五百圓也で買うた身体、かめへん筈やと瑞々しくなると、七年間忘れていたものが蘇つて来て、ダズ〜鼻を啜つて人形の様に身動きもしない女をながめながら——。
——わいはえらい目に逢つて来たんやで、ええ、あんたら知らんけど、わいは七年半と云うもの男ばかりの世界で辛抱して来たんやで——。
愚痴ッぽくなる源吉に、女は急に思い出した見たいにフフフと笑つて、どこか誰様やら見たに、
——あゝそう、あゝそう……の一点張り。
張り応えのうて、こんな女にわいの苦労はわからんのや。やつぱりパンパンするだけの女やとその気になつたが、いざとなると薩張気分も出ず、泣き出したい様な気持で、
——小夜ちゃん……お時間だぜつて。エプロン姿の声に慌てゝ見たが追っかず、えゝいもうこうなつたら、やる処までやらんと気がすまんと、有金残らずさらけ出した。
——ほんならこゝへ泊りはりますか。
——あゝ、泊らいでか。わいも男や、今更おめ〜帰れるかいな——。
——そらそや、ほんならお泊りやで。

下に腰かけて居直ると、女はむつくり起き上つて手を延して、こわれかけのトランクの蓋を開けてアメリカ煙草をとり出した。
——まあ落付いて一本吸いなはれ——夜道に日は暮れんよつてになあ——
日の暮れん夜が明けて、呆けた顔でフラフラ露路を出て来た源吉に、トンカツ屋の二階から、女は手を振つていた。十一時前と云うのに静まり返つた露路に朝日がシラ〜とさし込んで、十六円残つたバラ銭をポケツトでまさぐると、さあ阿呆な事してしもた。これもらどないしよう——。
こんな時、わいに親か身寄りあつたら苦労せえへんにの。
五圓のパン二つ買うと朝飯代りにほゝばり乍ら、阪急の構内をぶら〜していた。
あれも人の子モク拾い。——見れば一寸ぐらいから、手に火のつきそうな短い奴まで、丹念に拾い歩いてる奴があちこちにうよ〜していた。
——それ拾つてどないすんねん？……
——阿呆かいなオッサン、巻き直して賣るねんがな——
——わいも拾つてえゝか——。
——断らんかて、勝手に天下の大道に落ちてるもんや、せいだい拾いなと云われて、眼の覚めた気持で慌てゝ拾い出した。
丹念に数えて見たら夕方迄、大小とり合せて二百六十本、大事そうに短かいのを一本吸うてから、さつきの仲間に持つていつたら五十圓で買うてくれた。
蚤と虱に夜通しボリ〜掻きつづけて、ヒンヤリと朝風が地下道を吹き過ぎて二日目の朝が来た。こちらをもつと拾わんとことにはわいの日当にもならんと、それから精出して雑のうを空にすると毎日々々拾う事にかゝりきつた。
拾う事にかゝりきつて半月、どうやら命だけはつなげないだものの、仲間が多すぎてとんと近頃は拾いも少ない思いついたのが駅の構内で、電車待ちの線路に落ちた吸殻あつめ。生きんが為の才覚で、竹竿の先に針をつけたのを隠し持つと、大枚五円はり込んで省線鶴橋の駅に出掛けた。駅員の眼を竊み乍ら人浪を縫うてホームの上から軌道に落ちた吸殻めがけて、ブツリ〜と針にさすのが一日中面白う程集つてそうやこれも構内清掃、公衆道徳を実践してるんやと自ら言い聞かして、一杯になつた雑のう抱えて半月振りに駅前のカストリ屋で焼酎をひっかけた。

上がると、女が敷いた煎餅布団に黙って横たわった。感情を置き忘れた平たい顔の女が、今ふりかけたばかりの百円香水のどぎつい匂いを辺りに撒き散らしてコロリと傍らに転がると、「さあ好きなようにしなはれ」と言わんばかりの素振り——。

おずおずと手を出して、ようやくこの女は金五百円也で買った身体、構わないはずだと瑞々しくなると、七年間忘れていたものが蘇ってきて、グズグズ鼻を啜って人形のように身動きもしない女を眺めながら——。

「わいはえらい目に遭って来たんやで。ええ、あんたら知らんけど、わいは七年半というもの男ばかりの世界で辛抱して来たんやで——」

愚痴っぽくなる源吉に、女は急に思い出したみたいにフフフと笑って、どこか誰様やら見たように、
「あーそう、あーそう……」の一点張り。

張り合いがなくて、こんな女にわいの苦労はわからんのや。やっぱりパンパン（売春婦）するだけの女やとその気になったが、いざとなるとさっぱり気分も出ず、泣き出したいような気持ちで、
「小夜ちゃん……お時間だぜ」というエプロン姿の声に慌てて見たが追い付かず、えい、もうこうなったら、やるところまでやらんと気が済まんと、有り金残らずさらけ出した。

「ほんならここへ泊まりますか」
「ああ、泊まらないでか。わいも男や、今更おめおめ帰れるかいな」
「そらそうや、ほんならお泊まりやで」

下に腰掛けて居直ると、女はむっくり起き上がって手を伸ばして、壊れかけのトランクの蓋を開けてアメリカ煙草を取り出した。
「まあ落ち着いて一本吸いなはれ。夜道に日は暮れないからなあ」

日の暮れない夜が明けて、呆けた顔でフラフラ路地を出てきた源吉に、トンカツ屋の二階から女は手を振っていた。十一時前というのに静まり返った路地に朝日がしらじらと差し込んで、十六円残った端銭をポケットでまさぐると、「さあ阿呆なことしてしもた。これからはどうしよう……」

こんな時、わいに親か身寄りがあったら苦労しないのになあ。
五円のパンを二つ買うと朝食代わりに頬張りながら、阪急の構内をぶらぶらしていた。
あれも人の子モク（シケモク）拾い。見れば一寸（約3cm）くらいから、手に火のつきそうな短い奴まで、丹念に拾い歩いている奴があちこちにうようよしていた。
「それ拾ってどうするんや？」
「阿呆かおっさん、巻き直して売るんやがな」
「わいも拾ってええか」
「断らなくても、勝手に天下の大道に落ちているもんや。精一杯拾いな」と言われて、目が覚めた気持ちで慌てて拾い出した。

丹念に数えてみたら夕方まで、大小取り混ぜて二百六十本。大事そうに短いのを一本吸ってから、さっきの仲間に持っていったら五十円で買ってくれた。
蚤と虱に夜通しボリボリ掻き続けて、ひんやりと朝風が地下道を吹き過ぎて二日目の朝が来た。こちらをもっと拾わないことにはわいの日当にもならんと、それから精を出して雑嚢（ざつのう）を空にすると、毎日毎日拾うことに掛かり切りになった。

拾うことに掛かり切りになって半月。どうやら命だけは繋げたものの、仲間が多すぎて最近は拾いも少ない。思いついたのが駅の構内で、電車待ちの線路に落ちた吸い殻集め。生きんがための才覚で、竹竿の先に針をつけたのを隠し持つと、大枚五円張り込んで省線（国鉄）鶴橋の駅に出掛けた。駅員の目を盗みながら人波を縫ってホームの上から軌道に落ちた吸い殻めがけて、ぷつりぷつりと針に刺すのが一日中。面白いほど集まって、「そうや、これも構内清掃、公衆道徳を実践してるんや」と自らに言い聞かせて、一杯になった雑嚢を抱えて半月ぶりに駅前のカストリ屋で焼酎をひっかけた。

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Climbing the stairs, I lay down silently on the thin, hard *senbei* futon she had spread out. The woman, her flat face scrubbed of all emotion, rolled over beside me, scattering the pungent, cheap scent of a hundred-yen perfume she’d just applied. Her posture said, "Go ahead, do as you like."

I reached out hesitantly. I’d bought this body for exactly five hundred yen, so I told myself it shouldn't matter. As my senses quickened, something I had forgotten for seven years suddenly surged back. Sniffling, I gazed at the woman; she lay there as motionless as a doll.

"I’ve been through hell, you know," I muttered. "Yeah, you wouldn't know, but I’ve spent seven and a half years enduring a world of nothing but men."

Genkichi’s grumbling only made the woman let out a sudden, breezy laugh. "Oh, is that so? Is that so..." she repeated, looking as though she’d seen someone like him a thousand times before.

There was no satisfaction in it. A woman like this couldn’t possibly understand my suffering. I tried to convince myself she was just another *pan-pan* girl, but when the moment came, the mood vanished. I felt like I was on the verge of tears.

"Sayo-chan... time's up!" a voice called from an apron-clad figure. I looked up, startled, but couldn't gather my wits. "To hell with it," I thought. "If it's come to this, I'm staying until I'm satisfied." I emptied my pockets of every last cent I had.

"Well then, will you be staying the night?" she asked.
"Yeah, why wouldn't I? I’m a man, after all. I can't very well go home now."
"I suppose that's true. You’re staying, then."

She sat up, reached over, and opened the lid of a battered trunk to pull out an American cigarette. 
"Here, calm down and have a smoke. The sun hasn't set on the road yet."

The sunless night gave way to dawn. As Genkichi stumbled out of the alley with a dazed expression, the woman waved to him from the second floor of a tonkatsu shop. It was not yet eleven, but the alley was deathly silent. In the pale morning light, he fumbled in his pocket and found only sixteen yen in change. "Damn, I’ve played the fool. What do I do now?"

*If only I had parents or relatives at a time like this, I wouldn't be suffering so much.*

He bought two five-yen buns and gobbled them down for breakfast while wandering through the Hankyu station. Everywhere he looked, he saw "children of men" picking up cigarette butts (*mokuhira*). There were swarms of them, diligently scouring the ground for anything from an inch long to tiny stubs that looked like they'd burn your fingers.

"What do you do with those?" he asked one.
"Are you stupid, old man? We re-roll them and sell them!"
"Can I pick some, too?"
"Nobody's stopping you. They're just lying there on the 'Great Road of Heaven.' Pick all you can!" 

The realization hit him like a wake-up call, and he began to pick. By evening, he had painstakingly counted two hundred and sixty butts of all sizes. He smoked one short one—as if it were a precious treasure—and then took the rest to his new acquaintance, who bought them for fifty yen.

He spent the nights in underground passages, scratching incessantly at fleas and lice while the chilly morning wind whistled through. He realized that if he didn't pick more, he wouldn't even earn a day's wage. He threw himself into it, emptying his haversack every day to make room for more.

After two weeks of this, he was barely clinging to life. But there were too many competitors, and the pickings were getting slim. He hit on an idea: collecting the butts that fell onto the tracks at the station. Using his survivor's wit, he fashioned a bamboo pole with a needle on the end and hid it. He spent five whole yen on a ticket to Tsuruhashi Station. Dodging the station attendants and weaving through the crowds, he spent the day stabbing at the butts on the tracks from the platform. It was almost fun how many he gathered. "After all," he told himself, "I'm just cleaning the tracks and practicing public morality." Clutching his bulging haversack, he headed for a *kasutori* stall in front of the station to down a glass of shochu for the first time in two weeks.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows standard pre-modern/early-modern Japanese vertical text layout (*tate-gaki*). It is divided into three main blocks of text surrounding a central illustration.
*   **Typography:** Uses a mixture of Kyūjitai (old-style kanji) and early Shinjitai. Note the use of iteration marks (おづ〜, ダズ〜, シラ〜) which denote repetitive sounds/actions.
*   **Illustration:** The art style is characteristic of the **"Kasutori" genre**—sketchy, somewhat eroticized but grounded in the grim reality of the slums. The signature "Santaro" (三太郎) is likely the artist.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The dialogue in the illustration acts as a "pull quote" to draw the reader into the narrative's central turning point (the protagonist losing his money and being offered a cigarette).
*   **Contextual Markers:** Mentions of "Hankyu" (阪急) and "Tsuruhashi" (鶴橋) locate the story firmly in **Osaka**.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Despair (Kyodatsu):** The protagonist is a "repatriated soldier" (Hikiagesha) who has spent years in a "men-only world" (the front lines or a POW camp). His disorientation and lack of family support reflect the *kyodatsu* (state of lethargy/despair) common in 1945-1950 Japan.
*   **Pan-pan Girls:** These were street prostitutes who catered to both occupation GIs and Japanese men. They were a visible symbol of the post-war black market economy and the breakdown of traditional morals.
*   **Cigarette Scarcity (Mokuhira):** Tobacco was a luxury. Picking up discarded butts (*shikemoku* or *moku*) to re-roll and sell was a common "bottom-tier" job for the homeless and the "floating population" (*furōsha*).
*   **Kasutori Culture:** Named after a foul-smelling, low-quality shochu (*kasutori*), this term described the pulp magazines of the era. Like the drink, these magazines were cheap, intoxicating, and meant to be consumed and discarded quickly (lasting only "three issues," just as one might pass out after three cups of the liquor).
*   **Tsuruhashi Station:** A major transit hub in Osaka known then (and now) for its vibrant market and, in the post-war era, its massive black market.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **煎餅布団 (Senbei-buton):** A "rice cracker futon"—a futon that has become thin and hard from long use and lack of stuffing. Symbolizes poverty.
*   **パンパン (Pan-pan):** Slang for a prostitute during the occupation.
*   **薩張 (Sappari):** Usually written in kana; here written with ateji. Means "completely not" or "not at all" (in the context of mood).
*   **モク拾い (Moku-hiroi):** Cigarette stub picking. "Moku" is "kumo" (cloud/smoke) reversed.
*   **雑のう (Zatsunou):** A canvas haversack, usually military-surplus, very common among repatriated soldiers.
*   **カストリ (Kasutori):** Specifically refers to *Kasutori-shōchū*, a cheap, low-grade liquor made from sake lees.
*   **省線 (Shōsen):** Short for "Department of Railways Lines," referring to the government-run rail lines (later JNR/JR).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Masculinity and Loss:** Genkichi’s visit to the prostitute is an attempt to reclaim his manhood after seven years of war. His failure to "perform" and his subsequent weeping suggest the deep psychological trauma of the "lost generation" of soldiers.
*   **Rationalization of Survival:** The protagonist’s shift from shame to pride in his "needle-on-a-stick" method of gathering cigarette butts is a dark comedy. He justifies his desperate scavenging as "public morality" and "cleaning," showing how humans create meaning even in the lowest circumstances.
*   **The Urban Jungle:** The story depicts a world where everyone is a scavenger ("children of men picking butts"). There is a sense of communal struggle but also fierce competition.
*   **Nihilism vs. Resilience:** The ending—drinking cheap liquor after a successful "harvest" of trash—is a classic *Kasutori* trope. It doesn't offer a happy ending, only the temporary numbness required to survive another day.
