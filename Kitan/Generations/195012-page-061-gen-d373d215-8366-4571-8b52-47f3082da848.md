三、血の垂れた剃刀

「いいんです、仕事のことで、近くまでできたもんですから――お父さん、白髪が増えましたね」
　母のために苦しんでいるんでせう？　といいたい心で、信二は綺麗に分けた、つい二年前まで、黒々としていた父の、髪を眺めていつた。
「はあ――じつはお母さんのことですが、ちよつと――」
「変な噂を聞いたというのか？　知つてゐる知つてゐる。おまえは、そんなこと考えずに、仕事に精を出して、いい嫁を探しておればいいんだ。どうだ、いい相手がみつかつたか？　遠慮はいらんぞ」
　強いて快活を装つてゐる――。
　信二は、義母が急に、憎らしく、いやらしく、こんな父の、どこが気にいらないんだと思い
「お父さん、ほんとに、ご存知なんですか――？」
「ひつこいぞ、信二、若いものは、ひとの噂なぞ気にせずと、もつと朗らかに、歌でも唄つてりゃいいんだ、そして、締るときは締る、くよくよするのは女と年寄だけでたくさんだ、いいか」
「でも、今日、家へ帰つたら、表も、裏も、書日中だというのに――」
「それが、どうしたんだ」
　柔和な眼尻が、一瞬、緊張して、父は、ちよつと、身をのり出したが、すぐ思い止まり
「変なことをするもんぢゃない」
「いえ、ちよつと、忘れ物をしたもんですから」
「で、お母さんは、どうしていた」
「頭が痛いつて、寝ていたらしいんですが、それが――」
「言うな」
　鋭い言葉ではないが、信二は、ピツタリと口を抑えられたようなショックを受け、俯向いて、じつと、握りしめた父の、血管の浮いた手をみつめ、ホロリとした。
　やがて、父が
「信二、俺は、三月程前から知つている。しかし、どうにもならんのだ、俺は、毎日、夜遅くまでばかり讀んでゐる、それに、済みんとは思うが――それに俺は、あれを満足させる力もない、親父の代から躰より頭を使う方で、最初から、あれも、不満に思つたとたらしい。俺も人間だ、ひとなみに憎むことは知つてゐる。しかし、どうすればいいんだ。俺も、職務上、変な噂でもたてられれば――いや、一部の者は知つとるらしいが、黙つてくれてゐるんだ。それなのに、わざわざ、こちらから知らせるようなことはしたくない――な、信二、お父さんを思つてくれる気持はよく分るが、お母さんの身にもなつてやれ――これは、自分にもいい聞かしていることなのだ――辛いぞ、もういうてくれるな」
　逆光線の加減もあろうが、くぼんだ頬の皺が、にぶく光つた眼が、またたいて、父は、じつと俯向いている信二をみたり骨張つた自分の手をみつめたりした。

「お母さんッ！　お父さんの留守中になにごとですッ」
　信二の、神経質な顔は、怒りに蒼白く冴え、こめかみに、血管を浮かせ、キッチンと座つた膝を、こぶしで叩き
「あなたは、どなたです、留守中いつるも来る様ですが何の用事があるんです、この夜更けに――」
　八時であつた。
「信二ッ、言葉を慎みなさい、なんですツ、お母さんだけにならまだしも他所のお方に対して、どんなことを思つてるか知れないけれど、人を疑うもんぢゃありません、おまえの、縁談のためにも、きてもらつたんだよ、大倉さんつて、御懇意にしていただいてるお魚屋さんの御主人だよ、わざわざおまえのために、こんな遅くまで、お話し願つているのに、何事ですッ、赦りなさいッ」
　今夜、父は、送別会、信二は宿直、しかし、仕事があつて遅くなるからと替つてくれたので帰つてみると、表戸は開いたが、四十がらみの小柄の、がっちりした男が、長火鉢のいつも父が座る位置に、でん、と主人面して構えていたのだ。
　信二は、自制心を失つた。
　父のために、自分のために、と押しつけがましい母の言葉と、そちらが赦るべきを、なんということだ――と、いきりたち
「お母さんは黙つてなさいッ、大倉さんつとおつしやるんですね、折角ですが僕は、既に、いい交した女性がありますから、どうか、縁談の話はやめてして、いや、くるのも、やめて、書日中だけだと思つたら、夜中まで、母には父がありますッ」
「ヘッ、黙つて聞いてりゃなんだ、貴様、青二才のくせにつべこべと、俺がいったいどうしたんだ、奥さんは、大事なお得意さだ、貴様のような、やくざ野郎だとは知らずに、娘を、嫁にやろうと、なあに、奥さんから頼まれて、御相談に上つたんだ」
　筋肉質の締つた躰、浅黒いキリッとした顔、唇、その唇を食いしばり、強く、握りしめた鉄瓶を、投げつけそうな勢いで
「な、にツ」
「この大馬鹿野郎奴ッ」
　母も蒼白になり、血の気のひいた唇をふるわせ
「これッ、信二ッ、信二ッたら」
　片膝をたて、それに腕を突っぱり、勢い立とうとする信二の、その腕に両手でしがみつき、裾を、髪を乱し
「いけませんッ、お座りなさいッ」
「嫌ですッ、この、この泥棒猫奴ッ」
「なんでえ、生白い面しやがつて、パン助でもひつかけてやがるんだろう、貴様のようななまくら野郎に、頼まれたつて、もう俺の娘はやれねえッ」

3, The Blood-Dripping Razor

"It is okay, regarding work, because I was able to come nearby—Father, your white hairs have increased, haven't they?"
With a heart wanting to say, "You are suffering because of Mother, aren't you?", Shinji, looking at the hair of his father that until just two years ago was jet black and now neatly parted, said.
"Ah—actually, about Mother, a little—"
"Are you saying you heard strange rumors? I know, I know. You, without thinking of such things, should put energy into work and look for a good bride. How is it, did you find a good partner? No need for restraint."
He is forcing a display of cheerfulness—.
Shinji, suddenly finding his stepmother hateful and disgusting, wondering what she doesn't like about such a father,
"Father, really, do you know—?"
"You are persistent, Shinji. Young ones, without caring about people's rumors, should be more bright and just sing songs. And, when it's time to tighten up, tighten up. Fretting is plenty with just women and old people. Understand?"
"But, today, when I returned home, both the front and back, even though it was broad daylight—"
"What about that?"
The gentle corners of his eyes for an instant tensed, and the father leaned forward a little, but immediately stopped himself,
"It's not something you should do (meddle in)."
"No, just, because I had forgotten something."
"And, Mother, what was she doing?"
"She said her head hurt, and she seemed to be sleeping, but that—"
"Don't say it."
It was not sharp words, but Shinji felt a shock as if his mouth was shut tight, looked down, and stared at his father's gripped hand where veins stood out, and felt a tear well up.
Eventually, the father:
"Shinji, I have known since about three months ago. However, it can't be helped. I am just reading books until late every day, and although I feel sorry (inadequate)—also I don't have the power to satisfy her. Since my father's generation, we are the type to use heads rather than bodies, and from the start, she seemed to find that dissatisfying. I too am human; I know how to hate like anyone else. But what should I do? For me too, regarding my duties, if strange rumors are started—no, it seems some people know, but they are staying quiet for me. Despite that, I don't want to do something that purposefully informs them from this side—hey, Shinji, I understand well the feeling of thinking of your father, but try to put yourself in your mother's place too—this is something I am telling myself as well—it is painful, don't say any more."
The wrinkles of his hollowed cheeks, perhaps due to the backlighting, and his dullly shining eyes flickered, and the father looked at Shinji who was staring down, and then at his own bony hands.

"Mother! What is this while Father is away!"
Shinji's nervous face was pale with anger, veins standing out on his temples, hitting his knees where he sat formally with his fists,
"Who are you? It seems you always come while he's away, but what business do you have, at this late hour—"
It was eight o'clock.
"Shinji! Mind your words! What is this! It's one thing if it's just Mother, but against an outsider, I don't know what you are thinking, but you shouldn't doubt people. He came for the sake of your marriage talk. This is Mr. Okura, the owner of the fish shop we are close with. Even though he is talking for your sake until this late, what is this! Apologize!"
Tonight, the father had a farewell party, and Shinji had night duty. However, because he had work and would be late, someone covered for him, so when he returned, the front door was open, and a small, sturdy man in his 40s was sitting boldly at the *nagahibachi* where the father usually sits, acting like the master of the house.
Shinji lost his self-control.
At the pushy words of the mother saying "for Father's sake, for your sake," and that *she* should be the one apologizing—he flew into a rage,
"Mother, you stay quiet! You are called Mr. Okura, right? It's a waste of effort, but I already have a woman I've promised myself to, so please, stop the marriage talk, no, stop coming here. I thought it was just during the day, but even until midnight. Mother has a father (husband)!"
"Heh, I listen quietly and what is this. You, despite being a greenhorn, babbling on. What did I even do? The Madam is an important customer; without knowing she had a gangster-like brat like you, I was going to give my daughter as a bride. Hmph, I was asked by the Madam and came for a consultation."
A muscular tight body, a dark sharp face, lips. Biting those lips, with the momentum of someone about to throw the iron kettle he gripped tightly,
"Wha... what!"
"You big idiot!"
The mother also turned pale, her bloodless lips trembling,
"Hey! Shinji! Shinji, I say!"
Shinji, setting one knee up and bracing his arm to stand up with force—she clung to that arm with both hands, her hem and hair becoming disarrayed,
"You must not! Sit down!"
"I refuse! This, this thieving cat (homewrecker)!"
"What's that, showing that pale face, probably hooking up with some *pan-suke* (prostitute). Even if asked, I won't give my daughter to a dullard like you anymore!"

**III. The Blood-Stained Razor**

"It’s fine; I just happened to be working nearby—Father, you’ve grown quite a few more white hairs, haven't you?"
Shinji spoke while looking at his father’s hair, which had been jet black only two years ago but was now neatly parted. In his heart, he wanted to ask: *You’re suffering because of Mother, aren’t you?*
"Ah... well, about your mother, it’s just a bit—"
"You've heard the rumors, then? I know, I know all about them. Don't worry about such things, Shinji. Just focus on your work and find yourself a good wife. Well? Have you found anyone yet? Don't be shy with me."
He was clearly forcing an air of cheerfulness.
Shinji felt a sudden, sharp wave of loathing for his stepmother. He couldn't fathom what she found so lacking in a man like his father. 
"Father... do you *really* know what's going on?"
"Don't be persistent, Shinji. Young people shouldn't dwell on gossip; you should be bright, sing a song or two. Be firm when you must, but leave the fretting to the women and the elderly. Do you understand?"
"But today, when I came by the house, both the front and back doors were... and in broad daylight, no less—"
"What of it?"
The gentle corners of the father's eyes tightened for a fleeting second. He leaned forward as if to say more, but checked himself. 
"Don't go doing anything foolish."
"No, I... I just forgot something."
"And how was your mother?"
"She said she had a headache and was lying down, but—"
"Enough."
The word wasn't sharp, but it struck Shinji with the force of a physical blow, silencing him. He looked down and saw his father's hand gripped tight, the veins bulging. He felt a lump in his throat.
Finally, his father spoke again.
"Shinji... I've known for about three months. But there is nothing to be done. I spend every night buried in books; I know I’m a disappointment to her. My family has always been more about brains than brawn, and she seems to have been dissatisfied with that from the start. I’m human; I know how to hate as much as the next man. But what can I do? In my position, if a scandal breaks—well, some people already know, but they stay quiet for my sake. I don't want to be the one to invite trouble. Look, I know you’re worried about me, but try to see it from her perspective too. I tell myself the same thing every day. It’s hard, Shinji. Please, don't speak of it again."
The hollows of his father's cheeks and his dull, blinking eyes seemed to catch the backlight as he looked between Shinji and his own bony hands.

***

"Mother! What is the meaning of this while Father is away?"
Shinji’s face was pale with fury. Veins throbbed at his temples as he hammered his fists against his knees where he sat.
"And who are you? I hear you're always lurking around when he's gone. What business do you have here at this hour?"
It was eight o'clock in the evening.
"Shinji! Watch your tongue!" his mother cried. "I don't care what you think you know, but you have no right to treat a guest this way. He is here for the sake of your marriage prospects! This is Mr. Okura, the owner of the fish shop we patronize. He has stayed late specifically to discuss your future, and this is how you behave? Apologize at once!"
Tonight, his father was at a farewell party, and Shinji was supposed to be on night duty. But a colleague had covered for him, and when he arrived home, he found the front door unlocked. A sturdy, small-framed man in his forties was sitting insolently by the *nagahibachi*—the very spot where his father always sat—acting as if he owned the place.
Shinji snapped.
Hearing his mother's overbearing words about "Father's sake" and "your sake" when *she* was the one in the wrong, his rage boiled over.
"You stay out of this, Mother! So, you’re Okura? Don't bother. I already have someone, so forget the marriage talk. In fact, stop coming here altogether. I thought you only snuck around during the day, but here you are at midnight? My mother has a husband!"
"Heh, listen to this brat," Okura sneered. "A greenhorn like you has quite a mouth. The Madam is a valued customer. I had no idea she had such a thug for a son when I considered offering my daughter's hand. I only came because the Madam asked for my advice."
Okura’s muscular body tensed, his dark, sharp face hardening. He gripped the iron kettle so tightly it looked like he might hurl it.
"You... you what?"
"You damn brat!"
His mother turned white, her lips trembling. "Stop it! Shinji! Shinji, please!"
Shinji braced himself to spring up, but she clung to his arm with both hands, her hair and kimono falling into disarray as she struggled to hold him back. 
"You mustn't! Sit down!"
"I won't! Not for this... this house-wrecker!"
"Look at that pale, pathetic face," Okura spat. "Probably spends his time chasing after *pan-suke* street-walkers. I wouldn't give my daughter to a spineless weakling like you if you begged for her!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** This is a classic example of a mid-20th century Japanese popular magazine (*taishū zasshi*) layout. The text is arranged in vertical columns (*tategaki*) flowing from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style, characteristic of letterpress printing of the era. Notably, it uses small "tsu" (ッ) for emphasis at the ends of sentences, which was a common stylistic choice in "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines to denote shouting or intense emotion.
*   **Visual Elements:** The illustration on the right is a high-contrast, dramatic woodcut or scratchboard-style drawing of a hand holding a razor with blood dripping from it. This immediate visual "hook" identifies the genre as *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque) or hardboiled detective/pulp fiction.
*   **Structure:** The text is divided into a dialogue-heavy scene between a son and father, followed by a violent domestic confrontation. The page number (62) at the bottom suggests this is part of a serialized story.
*   **Linguistic Features:** The text uses historical kana usage (*rekishiteki kanazukai*), such as "云つてゐる" (shitteiru) and "ませう" (mashō), which places it firmly in the late 1940s to early 1950s—the transitional period before modern kana orthography became fully standardized in popular media.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (1940s-1950s):** This was the height of the "Kasutori" magazine era in Japan. These magazines were printed on cheap paper and often featured stories dealing with themes of adultery, domestic strife, and the breakdown of traditional family values in the wake of the war.
*   **Family Dynamics:** The conflict between the son (Shinji) and his stepmother/mother regarding her infidelity reflects post-war anxieties about "corrupted" women and the loss of the father's authority. The father is portrayed as an intellectual but physically "weak" or "inadequate" man, contrasting with the "muscular, dark-faced" fishmonger who represents a more primal masculinity.
*   **Miai (Arranged Marriage):** The use of a marriage proposal as a "cover" for an affair was a common trope in pulp fiction. It highlights the social pressure of *miai* and how it could be weaponized within domestic power struggles.
*   **Housing and Heating:** The mention of the *nagahibachi* (long brazier) and the iron kettle (*tetsubin*) places the story in a traditional Japanese home setting, where the brazier was the literal and metaphorical "center" of the household, usually reserved for the head of the house.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **パン助 (Pan-suke):** A derogatory post-war slang term for a prostitute, particularly those who catered to the occupying Allied forces.
*   **青二才 (Aonisai):** A "greenhorn" or inexperienced youth. Literally "blue two-year-old."
*   **泥棒猫 (Dorobō-neko):** Literally "thieving cat." A common idiom for a "homewrecker" or someone who steals another's partner.
*   **宿直 (Shukuchoku):** Night duty or staying overnight at one's workplace (common for office workers or public servants of the era).
*   **長火鉢 (Nagahibachi):** A long wooden charcoal brazier. Sitting in the father's spot at the *hibachi* is a grave insult and a sign of usurping his role.
*   **なまくら野郎 (Namakura-yarō):** A "dull-edged" fellow; a coward or a weakling.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Masculinity and Virility:** The central tension is between three types of men: the intellectual/weak father, the nervous/angry son, and the "muscular/sweaty" working-class interloper (Okura). The text implies the mother’s infidelity is a result of the father’s "inadequacy" (*satisfying her*).
*   **Domestic Breakdown:** The story explores the violation of the private sphere. The front door is left open, a stranger sits in the father's seat, and the mother "shames" her son in front of her lover.
*   **Generational Conflict:** Shinji's attempt to defend his father's honor is met with the father's weary resignation and the mother's manipulative "concern" for Shinji's future.
*   **Class Tension:** The intellectual family vs. the "rough" fishmonger. Okura's insults ("gangster brat," "pale face") target Shinji's perceived lack of "real" (physical) masculinity.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp, Serialized Novel (*Shōsetsu*).
*   **Genre:** Domestic Drama, Mystery, *Ero-Guro* (Pulp).
*   **Themes:** Adultery, Family Conflict, Masculinity, Betrayal, Post-war Japan, Class struggle.
*   **Classification:** Mature (themes of infidelity and domestic violence).
