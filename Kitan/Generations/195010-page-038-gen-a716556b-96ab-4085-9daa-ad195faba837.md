## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Southern Region Trouble Picture Scroll
Chapter Three: Guide to Love Affairs
By Tsukiya Shizushi
Art by Reiko

1
Opening the window, becoming only in underpants, while letting chest hair flutter in the wind, it was the time when "Policy" (Patrolman) Dora was napping.
"Tabe (Hello), Tabe, Tuan Dora."

—!
Because a sugary woman's voice occurred, Dora, who woke up with a start, rubbed his sleepy squinting eyes and turned around; the wife of the government office clerk Muskita was standing by the window smiling.
An adorable round face wrapped in a yellow flower-patterned neckerchief, however, because small wrinkles form at the corners of the eyes and the base of the nose when laughing, she indeed had the feeling of a woman in her thirties.
"What happened, Madam, in the middle of a day like this?"
Dora, while putting on a running shirt (undershirt), opened the front.
"Actually it is a disaster, Dora, I have lost my pure gold agate ring."
"Eh? —"
Dora peeled back his squinting eyeballs.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Troubles in the South: A Narrative**
**Chapter 3: A Guide to Romancing**
*By Shizushi Tsukiya / Illustrated by Reiko*

1
It happened while Dora, a local policeman, was taking a nap. He had the window flung open and was stripped down to his underwear, his chest hair fluttering in the breeze.
"Tabe! Good day to you, Tuan Dora."

Startled by the honeyed tone of a woman's voice, Dora snapped awake. He rubbed his sleepy, cross-eyed gaze and turned to find the wife of Muskita, a clerk at the government office, standing by the window with a beaming smile.
She had a charming round face framed by a yellow floral neckerchief. Yet, when she smiled, fine wrinkles creased the corners of her eyes and the bridge of her nose, betraying her age as a woman clearly in her thirties.
"What brings you here, Madam, in the blazing heat of midday?"
Dora pulled on an undershirt as he went to open the door.
"Oh, it's terrible, Dora! I've gone and lost my solid gold ring—the one with the agate stone!"
"What? No!"
Dora’s squinting eyes went wide with shock.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows the traditional Japanese vertical right-to-left reading order. The title is prominently placed on the right side in a stylized, hand-drawn font.
*   **Typography:** The main title (*Nanpō Izakoza Emaki*) and subtitle (*Irogoto no Tebiki*) use thick, brush-stroke-like characters to evoke a sense of drama or "pulp" fiction. The body text uses a standard Mincho typeface common in mid-20th-century printing.
*   **Illustration:** A central sketch-style illustration occupies the middle of the page. It depicts a man (Dora) in a sarong and a *peci* (Indonesian/Malay cap) with a woman appearing behind him. The art style is light and somewhat caricatured, fitting for a humorous or lighthearted story.
*   **Formatting Elements:**
    *   The chapter number "一" (1) is set apart.
    *   The page number "(38)" is centered at the bottom.
    *   Parenthetical glosses are used to explain foreign or specific terms (e.g., "Policy" being explained as "Patrolman").

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** This text likely dates from the 1940s (during the Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia) or the early post-war period (1950s). The focus on the "Southern Region" (*Nanpō*) was a major theme in Japanese media during the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" era.
*   **Setting:** The setting is clearly the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) or British Malaya.
*   **Terminology:**
    *   **Nanpō (南方):** "The South." During WWII, this specifically referred to the occupied territories in Southeast Asia.
    *   **Tabe (タベ):** A phonetic rendering of the Indonesian/Malay greeting *"Tabik"* or *"Tabe"*, often used as a respectful greeting or "excuse me."
    *   **Tuan (トアン):** The Indonesian/Malay word for "Sir" or "Mister," used here to address the policeman.
    *   **Policy (ポリシー):** A Japanese transliteration of the Indonesian/Malay word *Polisi* (Police). The text provides the Japanese equivalent *Junkei* (巡警 - patrolman) in parentheses for the reader.
    *   **Meno (瑪瑙):** Agate. A popular gemstone for jewelry in Southeast Asia.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Izakoza (いざこざ):** Trouble, tiff, or complication. Suggests a lighthearted or comedic conflict rather than a serious crime.
*   **Irogoto (色事):** A love affair, romance, or "amorous matters."
*   **Emaki (繪卷/絵巻):** Traditionally a picture scroll, but here used figuratively to mean a narrative or a "saga."
*   **Yabunirami (ヤブにらみ):** Strabismus (squint/cross-eyed). Used here as a physical characteristic of the protagonist, Dora, perhaps to make him appear more comical or less intimidating.
*   **Sanju-onna (三十女):** A woman in her thirties. In the mid-20th century, this often carried a connotation of maturity and "fading" youth or, conversely, a specific type of adult sensuality.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Exoticism (Orientalism):** The story plays on the Japanese fascination with the "tropical" South. Mentions of chest hair, heat, napping in underwear, and local dress (sarongs) serve to establish a "foreign" and somewhat "primitive" or relaxed atmosphere.
*   **Soft Eroticism:** The title "Guide to Love Affairs" and the description of the woman's "sugary voice" and Dora's state of undress suggest a "cheeky" or mildly erotic tone common in men's magazines of the era.
*   **Colonial Interaction:** The relationship between the "Policy" (Dora) and the clerk's wife shows a glimpse of local social life under an administrative structure (likely Japanese-led or influenced). The character Dora is likely a local recruit into the police force.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story (Series).
*   **Genre:** Comedy, Mystery (Light), Romance.
*   **Tags:** Nanpō (Southern Region), Colonial literature, 1940s-1950s, Masculinity, Tropical setting, Indonesian/Malay influence.
