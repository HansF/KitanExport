場所とはいへ映画館の裏通りで案外人の目につく場所だつたのと、正直な彼が量目の胡魔化しをしないところから、押すな／＼の大繁昌で忽ちの中に、電気式のパン焼機を買わなければ追いつかない有様であつた彼の妻は病身がちだつたが、子供が出来上り品を量つたり、儲かるので面白くなつて一生懸命に手傅つた。が、元来が弱い彼女は、連日の無理がたたつて、遂に寝込むようになつてしまつた。しかし次々と持ち込まれる委託品に忙殺されていた彼は十分妻の介抱を見てやるひまもなく一月ばかり寝ついた末、死んでしまつた。
　病身だつたとはいえ妻に死に別れてしまつて見れば、日常の不便は勿論の事。仕事が忙しいにつれて配給物の受けとりや近所の交際等が煩しくてならなかつた。
　それから半年ばかり経つて、その通りの角の家の二階を借りて一人の中年の女が移つて来た。
　三十前後の仇つぽい、どこか水商賣でもして来たような垢ぬけた感しがあつたが、別にそうゆう事を今しているようでもなかつた。
　彼女がせんべいを焼いて貰いに彼のところへ来て、いろ〜立話の末に彼に妻がない事を知ると、それから繁々と彼の所へ通つて来ては、洗濯物の仕末や、配給物のこと、それからだんだん、仕事の手助けまで、やり始めた。彼にしても丁度人手の足りない所で注文が殺到して困つていた折なので喜んで手傅つて貰つた。
　そうしている中に何時の間にか、私も一人で二階を借りているのも不経済だからと、僅かの荷物をたずさえて彼の家へ移つて来た。
　近所の人達は、あつかましい女だと初めはいろ〜とはなして噂をしたが、彼女は前の病身だつた妻とは違つて、脂ぎつた丈夫な身体で、キビ／＼とこま鼠のように立ち働いて彼の身廻りの面倒をよく見るばかりではなく近所づきあいも、中々如才なくちゃん／＼とするので自然とそんな噂も立ち消えとなつて行つた。
　遠くして近きは男女の中と言うが一つ家に二人きりの男女が住んで居ることだし、彼にしても、まだ三十をいくらも出たと言う齢ではないので、世間では、もうすつかり彼等を夫婦扱いにしてしまつていた。
　商賣の方は益々盛んとなつて注文は應じきれない程だつたし、最近のように、停電が多くなつてくると、委託されたもの全部を渡すわけに行かなかつた。そんな時に、彼女は、きちんとした秤で量つて何回にも分割して間違いなく、なるべく多くの人に平均に渡るようにしたので一層評判がよかつた。
　彼は結婚以来、弱々しい妻を迎え、十分家庭生活の愉悦を味わうこともなかつたのだが、彼女が新に入つて来てからは、前の妻では得られなかつた満足を興えられて一層仕事に精出すようになつた。
　然し彼にしても座食する職人で痩形の美男子であるので、一月二月と一緒に暮すうちに、余りに執拗で精力的な彼女の挑発には、だんだん厭気がさして来た。
　夜は勿論のこと、此の頃の様に晝間停電のために夜業をしなければならなくなると、彼は毎日午後になると、奥の一間で寝る事をする習慣であつたが、その昼寝の時間さえ、彼女によつて脅やかされるのであつた。
　こんな事から二人の間で、いさかいが起つたが、いつも女の方が悪いので、その度にあやまつておさまつて居たが、日一日と昂じてくるばかりで、改まる様子もなかつた。
　熱気の煎で仕事をするということはそれだけでも疲れるものであるが此の頃は、頭がボウとして前の様に仕事に励む元気もなくなつてきた。
　仕事をよくして呉れる點や、家の中の仕末や身廻りの世話をすることにかけては申し分無い女であるのだが只此の方面だけで、彼は幸福出来ないのであつた。
　寝不足と精力の消耗によつて目が落ち窪み、日に日に衰弱してゆく自分を意識するのであつた。そうかと言つて此の病以外になんの落度もない彼女を追い出すには、彼は余りにも人が好過ぎた。
　前の妻に死別れてから丁度一年目になる秋、主食の配給も米が續いでパン焼きはグツと閑になつた。
　仕事がひまになつたからと言つて今迄儲けていた彼には別段困りはしなかつた。それよりも寧ろ今まで過労によつて疲れた身体を慰やすのには絶好の機會であつた。
　然し質直な彼は、映畫や芝居にと遊び廻る氣持にはなれなかつた。夜も寝ないで気違いのようになつて彼の前に立つていた頃がなつかしく、此の頃は生活の空虚さが、ヒシ／＼と身に感じるのであつた。
　秤で働甲斐のある彼にゾッこん惚れ込んでいた彼女は、かゆい所へ手の届く様に、親切であつた。
　彼の言う事に逆うことはないし、毎日の惣菜なんかも出来るだけ切りつめながらも、彼の喜ぶもので食膳を賑わすのに如才がなかつた。
　事實、酒も煙草も嗜まない彼は副食物に對して相當うるさいのだが、彼女の手にかかつて調理されれば一流の彼も文句を言うことが出来なかつた。けれどもあの方面だけは又特別で、仕事がひまになつて、身体に余裕が出来てくると、前にも増して彼女の挑戦がひどくなつてくるのであつた。
　彼はこれを機会にとうとう意を決した。彼女が髪結いに行つている間に、片引き車に荷物を積むと、一里ばかり離れている同じ町の親類の内へ引越して行つた。
　彼女が髪結いから歸つてみると、パン焼き爐だけが、ポツンと火の気のないまま置かれてあつた。

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Though the shop was tucked away in an alley behind a cinema, it was surprisingly visible to the public. Because the proprietor was an honest man who never cheated on the weight of his goods, the shop was constantly thronged with customers. Soon, he reached a point where he couldn't keep up without purchasing an electric bread oven. His wife had always been sickly, but seeing the business thrive and the coins pile up as she weighed the finished loaves, she threw herself into the work with joy. However, her fragile constitution couldn't withstand the daily strain of overwork, and she eventually collapsed. Overwhelmed by the constant stream of commissioned orders, he had no time to provide her with proper care. After lingering in bed for about a month, she passed away.

Losing his wife was a blow, and not just because of her poor health; the daily inconveniences were immense. As his business grew busier, the chores of collecting rations and managing neighborhood social obligations became an unbearable burden.

About six months later, a middle-aged woman moved into the second floor of a house on the corner of that same street. She was a woman in her late twenties with a certain coquettish charm, possessing the polished air of someone who had worked in the "water trade," though she didn't seem to be engaged in such work at the time.

One day, she came to his shop to have some rice crackers baked. Through their idle chatter, she learned he was a widower. From then on, she began visiting him frequently. She started by handling his laundry and collecting his rations, gradually moving on to helping him with his work. Since he was shorthanded and struggling with a flood of orders, he was happy to accept her help. Before long, she suggested it was uneconomical for her to rent a room alone and moved into his house with her meager belongings.

The neighbors initially gossiped, calling her a brazen woman. But unlike his previous sickly wife, she was robust and full of vitality. She worked as tirelessly as a field mouse, not only taking impeccable care of his personal needs but also managing neighborhood relations so flawlessly that the gossip eventually withered away.

They say "distance breeds intimacy" between a man and a woman, and since they were living alone under one roof—and he was still only in his early thirties—society soon began treating them as a married couple. The business flourished even more; the orders were so numerous they couldn't all be filled. During the frequent power outages of late, it was impossible to fulfill every commission. At these times, she would use her scales to divide the goods precisely into smaller portions, ensuring as many people as possible received an equal share. This only enhanced their reputation.

Since his marriage, he had never truly known domestic bliss with his frail wife. But after this new woman arrived, she provided a satisfaction his first wife never could, and he threw himself into his work with renewed vigor.

However, the man was a craftsman—a lean, handsome man of quiet habits. After a few months of living together, her relentless and aggressive sexual advances began to wear him down. During the recent daytime power outages, he was forced to work through the night and made it a habit to nap in the back room in the afternoon. Even this rest was threatened by her persistent demands.

This led to occasional quarrels, but since the woman was always the one at fault, she would apologize each time and things would settle. Yet, as the days passed, her behavior only intensified. Working in the heat of the oven was exhausting enough, but lately, his head felt perpetually clouded, and he lacked the energy to focus on his craft.

In terms of her productivity, household management, and personal care, she was a perfect woman. But "in that one regard," he simply could not find happiness. From lack of sleep and the exhaustion of his vitality, his eyes grew sunken, and he felt himself wasting away day by day. Even so, he was too softhearted to cast out a woman who had no other fault but this.

Autumn came, marking exactly one year since his wife's death. The staple rations shifted to rice, and the demand for bread suddenly plummeted. Having earned well until then, the lack of work was no financial hardship. In fact, it should have been the perfect opportunity to rest his overworked body.

Yet, being a sober and serious man, he had no desire for the theater or cinema. He found himself perversely nostalgic for the days when she stood before him like a woman possessed, working through the night. Now, he felt only a piercing sense of emptiness in his life.

She, who was head-over-heels in love with his diligent nature, was attentive to his every need. She never disobeyed him, and even while pinching pennies on the daily groceries, she never failed to provide a bountiful spread of the side dishes he enjoyed. Indeed, as a man who neither drank nor smoked, he was quite particular about his food, but her cooking was so superb that even he could find no fault.

However, "that one area" remained the exception. As the work slackened and he regained some physical strength, her sexual "challenges" became even more aggressive than before.

Finally, he made up his mind. While she was out at the hairdresser, he loaded his belongings onto a handcart and moved to a relative's house in a neighborhood about four kilometers away.
When she returned from the salon, she found the bread oven sitting there, cold and solitary, without a trace of fire.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading from top to bottom and right to left. It is divided into three distinct columns per page, which is typical for literary magazines or "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines of the mid-20th century.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style serif, commonly used in printing. The character size is small, suggesting a publication meant for adult readers. 
*   **Punctuation and Symbols:**
    *   **Iteration Marks:** The text uses the kanji iteration mark "々" (e.g., in "いろ〜" and "ちゃん／＼") and the vertical kana repetition mark "／＼" for "押すな押すな" (osu-na-osu-na).
    *   **Dashes/Elongation:** Tilde-like marks "〜" are used for emphasis or to indicate prolonged sounds/repeated words in "いろ〜" (iro-iro).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "20" is centered at the bottom, framed by decorative dashes. Paragraph breaks are indicated by indents at the top of the columns.
*   **Style:** The prose is a mix of narrative description and internal monologue, characteristic of the "I-novel" (*Watakushi shōsetsu*) or social realism style.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII / Late 1940s):** Several clues point to the immediate post-war era (approx. 1945–1950):
    *   **Haikyū (配給):** The mention of "rationing" refers to the state-controlled distribution of food and necessities that continued long after the war ended.
    *   **Staple Foods:** The text notes a shift from bread (which became a staple when rice was scarce) back to rice distribution, indicating the gradual stabilization of the food supply.
    *   **Teiden (停電):** Frequent power outages were a staple of post-war life due to damaged infrastructure and coal shortages.
    *   **Meriken-ko (メリケン粉):** Mentioned indirectly through "bread making." This term (from "American flour") refers to the wheat flour imported during the Allied Occupation (GHQ).
*   **Social Conventions:**
    *   **Mizu-shōbai (水商売):** Literally "water trade," referring to the nightlife industry (bars, geisha, etc.). A woman described as having this "air" was seen as sophisticated but potentially morally suspect.
    *   **Marriage and Living Together:** The text highlights how quickly the neighborhood accepts the couple as "married" simply because they live together, reflecting the social pragmatism of the era where widows and widowers often formed "common-law" unions for survival.
*   **Health:** The mention of the first wife being "sickly" and the man's "exhaustion" reflects the high rates of tuberculosis and general malnutrition/overwork prevalent in the 1940s.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **量目 (Ryōme):** The weight of goods. "量目の胡魔化し" (cheating on the weight) was a common concern during times of food scarcity.
*   **仇っぽい (Adappoi):** Coquettish, charming, or seductive in a mature way.
*   **如才なく (Josai-naku):** Flawlessly, tactfully, or smartly. Doing something without a hitch or "without missing a beat."
*   **あの方面 (Ano hōmen):** "That direction/area." This is a classic Japanese euphemism for sexual relations or sexual appetite.
*   **髪結い (Kamiyui):** A hairdresser/hair salon. In this era, visiting a hair salon was a time-consuming social event for women.
*   **一里 (Ichi-ri):** A traditional unit of distance, approximately 3.9 kilometers (2.4 miles).
*   **片引き車 (Katahikiguruma):** A small hand-pulled cart used for transporting goods or moving house.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Sexual Incompatibility and Vitality:** A central theme is the disparity in vitality. The protagonist is "lean and handsome" but lacks the stamina to keep up with the woman's "insatiable" and "aggressive" sexual energy (referred to as her "provocation"). The text frames her sexual appetite as a destructive force that physically wastes him away.
*   **The Burden of Domesticity:** While the woman is "perfect" as a housekeeper and business partner, her sexual demands negate the happiness he should feel. This subverts the traditional "good wife, wise mother" trope by showing a woman who is *too* efficient and *too* energetic.
*   **Post-War Survivalism:** The story details the mechanics of survival—weighing rations, managing power outages, and the transition of staple foods. The "business" of life is intertwined with the characters' intimate relationships.
*   **Passive Masculinity:** The protagonist is depicted as somewhat passive. He accepts the woman's help, allows her to move in, and cannot bring himself to confront her. His only solution is to literally flee while she is away, leaving behind the "cold furnace" as a symbol of his extinguished passion/will.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story (Tanpen Shōsetsu).
*   **Genre:** Social Realism, Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense (mildly), Domestic Drama.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Rationing, Marriage, Sexuality, Overwork, Widowhood, Masculinity.
