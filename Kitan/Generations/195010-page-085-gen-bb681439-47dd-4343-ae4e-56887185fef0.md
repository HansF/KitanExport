（挿絵内テキスト）
ゆうべを　おもの
しみと　みえて
けさは　たいそう
どっ　くり
ねです

夜明け方の、月が出ている頃も趣がある。
もう明け方も間近いというのに、艶やかな板縁の端近くに、美しい畳を一枚敷いて、三尺の几帳を奥の方へ押しやって立てたりしているのは、その奥の方で、どんな事が行なわれているのであろうかと、気がかりで仕方がない。
なんでもない時には、やはり端近くに立てゝおく方が、あらぬ好色の誤解を受けないでよいのではないかろうか。
昨晩の相手の男と云うのはもうとうに帰つてしまつたらしく、若い美しい女が只一人で裏が濃く、表は少し色のさめた薄紫の衣を引きかぶつて長い豊かな髪の毛を波うたして寝そべつている。
香染めの単衣を着て、紅色の濃い縹の袴の腰紐が、大へん長く衣の下から出ているのが解けたまゝである。
紅い腰紐のしどけなく垂れている側に衣の裾から真ツ白い素足が、ちらりと覗いているのも、昨晩の情痴の名残りを思わして、なんとなく悩ましい。
その時これは又、どこから来たのであろうか、明け方の深い霧の中を、二藍の指貫、色のあえかな、いかばかりないな薄紫色、香染の狩衣、白い絹の単衣、紅色の衣の重ねが霧にびしよ濡れになつたのを着て、一人の男がだらしなく近附いて来た。
此の男は、昨夜、女の所で泊つて朝露の乾かない間に急いで家へ帰ろうと思つて葦の小道を辿つているのであつた。
丁度、途中でこの家の格子が上がつていたので、冗談に簾の端を少し上げてみると、さつきの女が、昨夜の男と別れたまゝのしどけない姿で寝そべつているのであつた。
「はあ、この女の恋人である男も、自分のように、朝霧を踏み分けて、慌て帰つて行つたのだなァ」
と、思われて、今の自分の姿との対照が面白くて、好色的な眼で暫く見ていると、女の枕下の方に朴の木の骨に紫の紙をはつた扇がひろげたまゝ落ちていた。
幅のせまい畳紙が、赤か紅かよくわからないけれど、少し色褪せて、几帳のもとに散らかつていた。
その時、人の気配に女は被衣の中から見ると、一人の若い男が、縁によりかゝつていた。
見も知らぬ男に自分のあらわな寝姿を見られて彼女はクしまつたクと思つた。
「昨夜のお名残と見えて、大そう御ゆっくりですね」
と男は皮肉たっぷりに関、あつかましくも体を半分ばかり簾の中へ入れたので、
「朝露よりも早く起きて慌てゝ帰つて行つた恋人の事を思いながら、こうして寝ているのですわ」
と女は度胸をきめて、寝そべつたまゝで答えた。女の枕元にある扇を、及び腰になつて、自分の持つている扇でかき寄せようとする男を、女は自分に近付いて来るのかと思つて、胸をときめかして、衣の中に身体を引き込ませるのであるつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**The Pillow Book**

(Text in illustration)
Last night's / deep / stains (memories) / appearing / this morning / very / soundly / sleeping.

The time of dawn, when the moon is out, also has charm. Even though dawn is already near, near the edge of the glossy wooden veranda, one beautiful tatami mat is laid, and a three-foot partition screen (kichō) is pushed toward the back and set up; one cannot help but be curious about what kind of things are being done in the back there. In ordinary times, it would probably be better to leave it standing near the edge so as not to receive misunderstandings of improper lewdness. The man who was the partner of last night seems to have already returned long ago, and a young beautiful woman is all alone, pulling over herself a light purple robe whose lining is dark and whose surface is slightly faded, with her long, rich hair waving as she sprawls. Wearing a clove-dyed unlined robe (hitoe), the waist-cords of her deep crimson-blue trousers (hakama), very long, are coming out from under the robe, remaining untied. Beside the red waist-cords hanging slovenly, pure white bare feet peeking out from the hem of the robe also make one think of the remnants of last night's passion, and it is somehow distressing/seductive. At that time, from where did he come again? Through the deep fog of dawn, wearing "futaai" (double-indigo) trousers, of a faint color, a somewhat light purple, a clove-dyed hunting robe (kariginu), a white silk unlined robe, and layers of crimson robes that became soaking wet in the fog, a man approached slovenly. This man, having stayed at a woman's place last night, was following a path through the reeds, thinking to hurry home while the morning dew was not yet dry. Just then, because the lattice of this house was raised on the way, as a joke he raised the edge of the bamboo blind (sudare) a little, and found the woman from before sprawling in the same slovenly state as when she parted from the man of last night. "Ah, the man who is this woman's lover must have also, like me, trodden through the morning mist and hurried home," he thought, and the contrast with his own current figure being interesting, he watched for a while with lewd eyes; then, toward the woman's pillow, a fan made of magnolia wood ribs with purple paper pasted on it lay fallen open. Narrow folding papers (tatamigami), whether red or crimson one couldn't tell well, but slightly faded, were scattered at the base of the partition screen. At that time, sensing a person, the woman looked out from inside her covering robe and saw a young man leaning against the veranda. To have her exposed sleeping figure seen by a man she didn't even know, she thought, "Oh no." "It seems like a lingering memory of last night; you are very much taking your time," the man said with plenty of irony, and impudently putting about half his body inside the blind, "I am sleeping like this while thinking of the lover who woke earlier than the morning dew and hurried home," the woman answered, gathering her courage while remaining sprawled. As the man, leaning over, tried to scrape toward him the fan near the woman's pillow using the fan he held, the woman, thinking he was approaching her, felt her heart flutter and drew her body into her robes.

**The Pillow Book**

*(Inscription in the drawing: She seems still immersed in the memories of last night, for this morning she sleeps most soundly.)*

There is a particular charm to the hour of dawn when the moon still lingers in the sky. Even as daybreak approaches, one sees a single fine tatami mat laid out near the edge of a polished wooden veranda, with a three-foot partition screen pushed back and left standing. One cannot help but wonder, with a touch of restless curiosity, what secret tryst might be unfolding behind it. In ordinary circumstances, it would surely be wiser to leave the screen near the edge to avoid any scandalous misunderstandings.

The man from the night before seems to have departed long ago. A young, beautiful woman lies there alone, huddled under a light purple robe—the lining a deep hue, the outer fabric slightly faded—her long, luxuriant hair cascading in waves about her. She wears a clove-dyed unlined garment, and the exceptionally long waist-cords of her deep indigo-red trousers trail out from beneath her robes, left carelessly untied. Beside those dangling crimson cords, a glimpse of snow-white feet peeks from under the hem—a sight that evokes the lingering traces of last night’s intimacy, possessed of a certain heart-stirring, melancholic beauty.

Just then, appearing from who-knows-where through the thick morning mist, a man approaches with a casual air. He is dressed in double-indigo trousers of a delicate, pale violet, a clove-dyed hunting robe over a white silk tunic, and layers of crimson robes, all drenched through by the heavy fog. Having spent the night at a lady's house, he was picking his way through a reed-lined path, hurrying to reach home before the morning dew dried.

Noticing that the shutters of this particular house happened to be raised, he playfully lifted the edge of the bamboo blind. There he saw the woman, still reclining in the same disheveled state as when her lover had left her. "Ah," he thought, "the man she loves must have also trodden through the morning mist to return home, just as I am doing now." Finding the parallel with his own situation amusing, he lingered, watching her with a voyeuristic eye. Near her pillow lay a fan of magnolia wood and purple paper, fallen open. Scraps of letter paper—red or perhaps crimson, it was hard to tell in the dim light—lay faded and scattered at the base of the screen.

Sensing a presence, the woman peered out from beneath her robes to find a young stranger leaning against her veranda. Horrified to be seen in such an exposed state by a man she did not know, she thought, *“How shameful!”*

"Still savoring the remnants of last night, I see? You are taking your ease indeed," the man remarked sarcastically. With brazen boldness, he thrust half his body beneath the blinds.

Mustering her courage, the woman replied from where she lay, "I am lying here thinking of my lover, who rose even earlier than the morning dew to hurry home."

As the man leaned forward, using his own fan to hook and draw toward him the purple fan lying by her pillow, the woman—thinking he was moving to embrace her—felt her heart leap, and she instinctively drew herself deeper into the folds of her robes.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** This is a classic magazine or anthology page layout from the mid-20th century. It features a vertical orientation with the text flowing from top-to-bottom, right-to-left.
*   **Typography:** The main title "枕草子" (The Pillow Book) is written in a bold, stylized brush-script font. The body text uses a standard Mincho-style typeface common in printing. Furigana (reading aids) are provided for difficult kanji (e.g., 几帳/きちょう, 単衣/ひとえ, 縹/はなだ).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is prominent at the top right. An illustration occupies the top center, providing a visual anchor. The text is divided into paragraphs, though the indentation is minimal, common in older Japanese formatting.
*   **Illustrative Elements:** The drawing at the top reflects a "modern-classic" style—a blend of traditional Heian-era motifs (the courtier's hat) with a more whimsical, mid-century illustrative touch. The handwritten text in the bubble is stylized *hentai-gana* or cursive kana.
*   **Formatting Features:** The use of repetition marks (ゝ, 々) is consistent with the era's orthography. The page number "(85)" is centered at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Source Material:** The text is a modernized version of *The Pillow Book* (*Makura no Sōshi*), a collection of essays and observations written by Sei Shōnagon, a lady-in-waiting to Empress Teishi during the Heian period (late 10th century).
*   **Publication Era (1950s/60s):** This specific rendition likely comes from a popular literary magazine or a "modern classics" series for women. During the post-war period, there was a resurgence of interest in classical literature, often presented in more accessible, romanticized language.
*   **Kayoi-kon (Visiting Marriage):** In the Heian period, men typically visited women at night and left before dawn. The "morning-after" (kinuginu) was a critical moment for poetic exchange and social etiquette.
*   **Aesthetics of "Shidokenai":** The text emphasizes the "disheveled" (*shidokenai*) appearance of the woman. In Heian aesthetics, the messiness after a night of love was considered beautiful and evocative (*aware*), rather than merely untidy.
*   **Color Symbolism:** Terms like *Futaai* (double-indigo) and *Kōzome* (clove-dyed) refer to specific, high-status vegetable dyes used by the aristocracy.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **几帳 (Kichō):** A portable silk partition screen used in Heian palaces to provide privacy.
*   **単衣 (Hitoe):** An unlined silk robe, often the innermost layer of formal court dress.
*   **縹 (Hanada):** A traditional Japanese color, a light blue-indigo. Here it refers to the color of the *hakama* (trousers).
*   **指貫 (Sashinuki):** Voluminous silk trousers worn by noblemen, tied at the ankles.
*   **狩衣 (Kariginu):** Literally "hunting dress," it was the informal daily wear for Heian nobles.
*   **畳紙 (Tatamigami/Tatōgami):** Thick paper used for wiping brushes or wrapping small items, often carried in the folds of a robe.
*   **情痴 (Jōchi):** Passion, blind love, or the dazed state of being in love.
*   **被衣 (Kazuki/Katsugi):** A veil-like garment or robe worn over the head by women for modesty.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and Eroticism:** The narrative hinges on a "peeping" motif. The protagonist (the wandering man) spies on the woman, and the text lingers on her bare feet and disheveled clothes, creating a sense of voyeuristic intimacy.
*   **Witty Repartee:** A core theme of *The Pillow Book* is the "battle of wits" between men and women. The woman's response to the man's sarcastic comment shows her quick thinking and "modern" (for the 10th century) independence.
*   **The Beauty of Transience:** The morning mist, the fading colors of the robes, and the "remnants" of the night all contribute to the Japanese aesthetic of *mono no aware*—the pathos of things that are beautiful precisely because they are fleeting.
*   **Romanticized Tradition:** By rewriting the Heian classic in more modern prose, the author of this piece (likely a Showa-era writer) frames traditional courtly love as a relatable, if exotic, romantic ideal for the contemporary reader.
