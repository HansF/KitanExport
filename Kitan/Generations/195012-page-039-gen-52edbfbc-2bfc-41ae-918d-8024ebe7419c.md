一、素破らしい妙案

どこの會社も、整理々々と、えらいやかましいことちやと思つていたら、こつちがクビになつてしまつた。
退職金三万円、それでポイだ。
元来、女郎買いの好きな私、といつても決して女に魂まで奪われるクチでなかつた。色眼をつかつて、ちいと甘つたれてきたつて、大抵ソコを割つてみりや、慾ひとつ、こちらもそれを識つているから終始打算的かつ鋭角的に振舞うのだつた。
それは、キヤバレー、社交喫茶、どこへ行つても同じことだ。
さて、ここに、汗と脂で朝から晩まで働き續けたカスが三万円ある。それをモトデに、なんとかボロい儲けがしたいものだと、天井の節穴を數えながら、トウオイツ思案投首、やがて、眠くなつて、うとくとしかけた時、素晴らしい妙案が電光の如く脳裡に閃いた。
善は急げだ、早速明日からその基礎工事にとりかかろう。

二、女将には亭主がない

私は、まだ二十五才を過ぎたばかりで、無論獨身だ、男前もまんざらでない、色男といつたタイプでないが、上原謙というヤクシヤと比べたつて、そうヒケをとらない背丈をしている。自惚れではないが、遊びに行つても、金を拂うかぎりよくモテル方である。
夕方、宮川町へ乗りこんで、妓を二三人あげて、あまり飲めぬ酒を飲む振りをして、私は放蕩三昧に陶酔した。
雨が降つている。客はひとりもいない、抱え妓も三人ぐらい、という家を撰んでの、この振舞いだつた。
「帰つてよろしい、わしはこの妓と寝る」
一番まずい顔の妓を小脇にかかえ、そういつて千円札を一枚宛バラ撒いてやる。
トタンに妓の眼の色が変る。チヤポヤして、まだ貰えるか知らんと、おみこしをあげ得ない。
酒に酔うてはいるものの、大きな計画を胸に秘めている私は、細大もらさず、彼女等の心のウゴキを觀察しているが、オクビにも顔色にも出さない。金持のドラ息子然としている。
二時間ほど過ぎた。私は、もう帰えるのでお愛想をいつた。
花代と酒五六本、附出し等でワズカ二千円足らず、その勘定を済ませて頭に、千円一枚、皆にといつて出してしまつた。

Love Tactics Central Breakthrough

**[Main Headings]**
Young Swallow Tactics
I am a juggling of four people
Teramoto Akira

1. A Splendid Ingenious Plan

At every company, "restructuring, restructuring," I thought they were making a terrible noise about it, and then I was the one who got fired.
Retirement pay 30,000 yen, and with that, discarded.
Originally, I am someone who likes buying prostitutes, though I was never the type to have my soul stolen by a woman. Even if they use flirtatious eyes and act a bit pampered, if you break it down, it's usually just greed; since I know that, I always behaved in a calculating and sharp-angled manner.
That is the same whether I go to cabarets or social cafes.
Now, here is 30,000 yen, the dregs of working from morning till night with sweat and grease. With that as capital, thinking I want to make some easy money somehow, while counting the knots in the ceiling, lost in deep thought, eventually becoming sleepy, just as I started to doze off, a splendid ingenious plan flashed in my mind like lightning.
Good things should be done quickly; let's start the foundation work immediately from tomorrow.

2. The Mistress has no Husband

I have only just passed twenty-five years of age, and of course, I am single. My looks aren't bad either. I'm not the "pretty boy" type, but compared to the actor named Ken Uehara, I have a height that doesn't fall behind. It's not conceit, but when I go out to play, as long as I pay money, I'm the type that is quite popular.
In the evening, I rode into Miyagawa-cho, called up two or three geisha, and pretending to drink sake I couldn't really handle, I intoxicated myself in debauchery.
It was raining. There were no other customers, a house with only about three resident geisha—it was this kind of house I chose for this behavior.
"You may go home, I will sleep with this girl."
Holding the girl with the plainest face under my arm, I said that and scattered thousand-yen bills one by one.
In that instant, the color of the girls' eyes changed. They pampered me, wondering if they might get more, and wouldn't lift their palanquins (wouldn't leave).
Though I was drunk on sake, I, who kept a big plan hidden in my chest, observed the movements of their hearts without missing a single detail, but I didn't let it show in my expression or even a hint. I acted like the profligate son of a wealthy man.
About two hours passed. Since I was going home, I said the parting words.
For the geisha fees, five or six bottles of sake, and appetizers, it was less than 2,000 yen. After finishing that bill, I took out a thousand-yen bill for the staff and said, "One thousand yen, for everyone."

Operation Love: Frontal Assault

**[Main Headings]**
The Young Swallow Gambit
Juggling Four Women at Once
By Akira Teramoto

1. A Brilliant Scheme

Everywhere I turned, companies were screaming about "downsizing" and "restructuring." I thought it was just a lot of noise until the axe finally fell on me. Thirty thousand yen in severance pay—and then, "don't let the door hit you on the way out."
Now, I’ve always been fond of the ladies of the night, but I was never the sort to let a woman get a grip on my soul. They might bat their lashes and play the sweet ingenue, but strip it all away and it’s usually nothing but greed. I knew the score, so I always kept my interactions cold, sharp, and strictly business. It was the same story whether it was a cabaret or a high-end social lounge.
So, there I sat with thirty thousand yen—the miserable remains of years spent sweating and grinding from dawn till dusk. I wanted to turn that stake into a real killing. Staring up at the knots in the wooden ceiling, I racked my brain until I was half-asleep. Just as I was drifting off, a brilliant plan struck me like a bolt of lightning. 
Strike while the iron is hot, they say. I decided to start laying the groundwork the very next day.

2. A Madam Without a Master

I’m just past twenty-five, single, and not bad-looking, if I do say so myself. I’m no matinee idol, but I’ve got the height to stand tall next to a leading man like Ken Uehara. It’s not just ego talking; as long as the cash is flowing, I’ve always been a hit with the ladies.
That evening, I rolled into the Miyagawa-cho district. I called for two or three girls and made a show of indulging in sake I could barely stomach, drowning myself in a performance of pure debauchery. 
It was a rainy night. I had specifically chosen a quiet house with no other customers and only a few girls on staff.
"The rest of you can go. I'm taking this one to bed," I announced, tucking the homeliest girl in the bunch under my arm. To drive the point home, I started tossing thousand-yen bills around like confetti.
The atmosphere changed instantly. The girls started fawning over me, hoping for another windfall, hovering around like they never wanted the night to end. Even through the alcoholic haze, I kept my grand plan locked tight in my chest. I watched their every move, gauging their reactions while maintaining the perfect mask of a spoiled rich kid. 
Two hours later, I called for the check. Between the girls, the half-dozen bottles of sake, and the food, it barely broke two thousand yen. I settled the bill, then slapped another thousand-yen note on the table for the staff. "For the house," I said, and made my exit.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** This is a classic example of a mid-20th century Japanese magazine layout. It uses vertical text (tate-gaki) read from right to left. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The most striking feature is the vertical chain of hearts on the right, containing the stylized title "恋愛戦術中央突破" (Love Tactics: Central Breakthrough). This suggests a theme of romance, or more likely, a "how-to" or fictional account of seduction and social climbing.
*   **Typography:** The title uses a bold, blocky font. The author's name and section headings use standard serif-style typeface. The body text is smaller but legible, typical for the cheap paper used in "Kasutori" magazines.
*   **Illustrations:** A stylized drawing of a woman’s face and shoulders appears at the top right, framed by the decorative hearts. Her expression is somewhat melancholic or seductive, fitting the "noir" or pulp tone of the story.
*   **Columns:** The page is divided into vertical columns of text, with section headings clearly numbered (一, 二).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Japan):** The mention of "30,000 yen" as a severance package and the focus on "restructuring" (整理) suggests the late 1940s or early 1950s. During the "Dodge Line" austerity measures (1949), many Japanese workers were laid off.
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** This text likely comes from a "Kasutori" magazine—pulp publications named after a cheap, harsh liquor. They flourished in the immediate post-war period, focusing on "3S" (Sex, Screen, and Sport) and often featured cynical, hard-boiled stories of survival and decadence.
*   **"Wakai Tsubame" (Young Swallow):** This is a famous Japanese idiom for a younger man kept by an older woman. It originated from a letter sent to the feminist Raicho Hiratsuka by her younger lover, Hiroshi Okumura. The title suggests the protagonist's strategy involves becoming such a "young swallow."
*   **Miyagawa-cho:** One of the five *Hanamachi* (geisha districts) in Kyoto. The protagonist is visiting a traditional entertainment house to establish a false persona of wealth.
*   **Ken Uehara:** A major Japanese film star of the 1930s-1950s, known for his handsome, sophisticated looks. The protagonist compares himself to Uehara to establish his attractiveness.
*   **Currency Value:** In the late 1940s, 1,000 yen was a significant amount of money (a month's starting salary for a teacher might be 3,000–5,000 yen). Throwing around 1,000-yen bills was an extreme display of wealth intended to manipulate the people around him.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **整理々々 (Seiri-seiri):** Repetition of "restructuring/downsizing." Reflects the economic instability of the era.
*   **ボロい儲け (Boroi moke):** Slang for "easy money" or "making a killing."
*   **思案投首 (Shian nagekubi):** An idiom meaning to be at one's wit's end or lost in deep, difficult thought.
*   **おみこしをあげ得ない (Omikoshi wo agenai):** Literally "cannot lift the palanquin." An idiom meaning someone is comfortably settled and refuses to leave or get moving.
*   **ドラ息子 (Dora-musuko):** A profligate, idle, or "playboy" son of a wealthy family.
*   **お愛想 (O-aiso):** In this context, it refers to the bill or the act of paying and leaving an establishment.
*   **素破らしい (Subarashii):** Usually written as 素晴らしい. The use of "素破" (which can mean a spy or thief) might be a playful or archaic stylistic choice by the author.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Cynicism and Calculation:** The protagonist views human relationships, especially with women in the entertainment industry, as purely transactional and driven by "greed" (慾). He intentionally manipulates people using his severance pay to create a fake persona.
*   **Masculinity and Social Climbing:** The story explores the idea of using one's looks and borrowed capital to "conquer" or survive in a harsh post-war society. The "Central Breakthrough" title suggests a military-like strategic approach to romance and money.
*   **Performative Wealth:** The protagonist understands that respect in this world is bought. By tipping excessively and acting like a "spoiled son," he gains information and status that he plans to use for a larger "ingenious plan."
*   **The "Swallow" Archetype:** The subtext involves the protagonist positioning himself to be "taken in" by a wealthy woman (the "Okami" or proprietress mentioned in the second section heading), using his youth and looks as his primary assets.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Story, Serial Novel.
*   **Themes:** Post-war survival, Social Climbing, Seduction, Masculinity, Money, Deception.
*   **Classification:** Kasutori literature, Mature (due to themes of prostitution and debauchery).
