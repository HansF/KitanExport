## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Sexual movements have begun to be discovered. Since being tied [she] does not speak a single word, but as a masochist, [she] was firmly feeling joy with [her] body.
Today, [I] decided to subject [her] to thorough shame-torture. Therefore, this time, using the wainscoting of the wall, [I] did a "character-of-big" (star-shaped) tie. Making both legs open to the left and right to the full extent, [I] tied [her] down. Sakon-san has completely entrusted [her] body to me, and I, in order to torment her further, decided to apply a vertical rope.
Tying the breasts, passing the neck-rope between the breasts, pulling [it] as if to press down the thick forest, in order to make [the rope] cross the center of the crevice, with thumb and index finger [I] opened the petals to the left and right. Together with damp raw juice, the clear pink-colored red flesh [its] figure (was revealed).

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Signs of sexual arousal have begun to manifest. Though she hasn't uttered a single word since being bound, she is clearly experiencing the rapture of a masochist through her entire body.
Today, I decided to subject her to an exhaustive ordeal of public humiliation. Utilizing the wainscoting on the wall as an anchor, I bound her in a spread-eagle "star" formation. I forced her legs wide apart and secured them firmly. Sakon had surrendered herself completely to me, so I decided to add a vertical rope to further her torment.
After binding her breasts, I ran the neck rope between them, pulling it tight so that it pressed down against the dense thicket of hair. To ensure the rope crossed the very center of her crevice, I used my thumb and forefinger to spread the petals of her labia. Amidst a damp secretion, the vivid pink of her inner flesh was revealed...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page features a vertical text block on the right side, balanced by two monochromatic photographs on the left. The top photograph shows a woman bound in a standing spread-eagle position, while the bottom shows her lying down.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a standard *Ming-cho* (Mincho) typeface common in post-war Japanese periodicals. The vertical orientation is traditional for Japanese narrative text.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text acts as a descriptive narrative for the imagery, guiding the reader's gaze and providing a "story" to the fetishistic display.
*   **Page Numbering:** The numeral "22" appears in the bottom right corner, indicating this is part of a larger magazine feature.
*   **Photo Style:** The photography is high-contrast black and white, characteristic of the 1950s and 60s "bondage" (kinbaku) magazines, focusing on the texture of the rope against the skin.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** This text likely originates from the late 1950s or 1960s. This was the "Golden Age" of Japanese fetish magazines (such as *Kitan Club* or *SM Select*), which catered to the *SM* (Sado-Masochism) subculture that flourished in the post-war period.
*   **Kinbaku (Bondage):** The text describes *kinbaku*, a Japanese style of bondage that evolved from Edo-period martial arts (*hojojutsu*) into a modern erotic art form.
*   **Social Conventions:** The narrator uses polite verbal endings (*-mashita*), which was a common stylistic choice in erotic literature of the era. It creates a clinical, semi-formal detachment that contrasts sharply with the explicit sexual content, often framing the "torturer" as a composed gentleman-enthusiast.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **羞恥責め (Shūchi-zeme):** "Shame-torture" or "humiliation ordeal." A common theme in SM literature involving public or psychological exposure.
*   **大の字縛り (Dai-no-ji shibari):** A spread-eagle tie. It is named after the kanji for "big" (大), which resembles a person with arms and legs spread wide.
*   **幕板 (Maku-ita):** Frieze board or wainscoting. In this context, it refers to a wooden architectural element used as an improvised anchor for the ropes.
*   **クレパス (Kurepasu):** Likely a phonetic transcription of "crevice" (or "crevasse"), used here as a euphemism for the vaginal opening. Note: In modern Japanese, *Kurepasu* usually refers to "Cray-pas" (oil pastels), but contextually here it refers to anatomy.
*   **樹林 (Jurin - Forest) & 花びら (Hanabira - Petals):** Classical erotic metaphors for pubic hair and the labia, respectively.
*   **生ジュース (Nama-jūsu):** "Raw juice." A period-specific euphemism for vaginal lubrication.
*   **紅肉 (Kōniku):** "Red flesh" or "crimson meat," referring to the internal mucosal tissue.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Total Submission:** The text emphasizes the subject's (Sakon's) complete surrender ("completely entrusted her body"), which is a central trope in masochistic fantasy.
*   **Silent Pleasure:** The description of her being silent yet "feeling joy" serves to legitimize the bondage as a consensual, albeit extreme, erotic exchange.
*   **Voyeurism and Anatomical Focus:** The transition from general binding to a detailed, almost clinical description of the genitalia highlights the voyeuristic nature of the publication.
*   **Power Dynamics:** The narrator maintains total control, deciding which "tortures" to apply next, positioning the reader to identify with the dominant perspective.
