## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

「私女学生の修学旅行に東京から日光へ行つた時だつたわ。別クラスの子で先生に犯された人がいたのよ。旅館ではなくて散歩にでた河原でだつたけれども。‥‥‥痛いッ!! と突然草のかげで声がしたので、おなじように散歩していた女の子は怖くなつて逃げかえつて来たにそれがそうだったのですつて。あれ如何？」

「成程そんなことも世の中にはあるのかね。それ賛成するよ」

久美子は立ちあがつて電燈を消した。想像の世界をより豊富に明るくするためだつた。久美子は清楚な処女に化して男に甘え、男の心が獣性となつて伸びてきた時、人生の汚濁をみたように叫びひとりと逃げた。

胸が波打ちはづんでいた。男は一気に慕いより空想の世界で甘美な夢を追つていた。

意外にもそのからだは初々しい触感にみちみちて、征服の熱望を掻きたてるのであつた。強引に圧倒していく逞しい男の生活力を自覚して、久美子ぶりに誠一は満足した。

誠一と久美子の夫婦生活にそうして青春が戻つてきた。しかし、いつまでも教師と女学生でもないと思い、電燈をつけてもできる種を考えた。その頃ちょうど戸田は夏休みになつて鳥取へ帰省していたのでそれから想い、いつか、夫が下宿人と妻との不倫な関係を疑つて妻を折檻することにした。いくら騒いでも聞かれる者のない気楽さから

「戸田とどんなことをしたかその口からきいてやる」

とか

「戸田といいことをしたここが憎らしい」

などと戸田護の名前が毎夜くりかえされた。何も知らない戸田こそ災難である。この遊戯の方法は盡きず一夏を久美子たちは充分堪能して過した。

そのためもあろうか、久美子は近頃自分が本当に戸田護が好きになつているような錯覚におちいるのである。戸田の部屋にいて立去り難い原因もそれであつた。

三、誤　解

足音がして現実に戸田が帰つてきていたのに久美子は気づかなかつた。

「なあんだ奥さんでしたか。誰かと思いました。今日は朝の講義だけであとはズボラです」

戸田の声にはじめて掃除をやりかけてぼんやりしていた自分に気づき久美子は慌てるのであつた。

「あらあら私お掃除の途中で居眠りしていたわ。あなたのお部屋風がよくおつて気持いいものですから」

久美子が照れかくしを言いながら立あがるその手を戸田は勢いよく掴んだ。

「奥さん事情は皆裏の山崎君からきいています。僕が休暇で帰つていたあいだ、奥さんは御主人から、僕との仲に肉体関係があると疑われて責めさいなまれていたそうぢやありませんか。しかも奥さんはハッキリ僕のことを好きだと言明なすつていたそうで、戸田はどんなに感激したか。山崎と抱きあつて泣いた位いです」

戸田がぎゆうぎゆう握つてくる手首が痛いので久美子ははろはろと涙を流した。

戸田はそれをを邪推して一そう感激するのである。夫婦のむつ言を隣家の息子が聞いていたのだ。遊戯のヤマを効果的にするために戸田が好きだと言つた記憶も久美子にあつた。これはたいへんな誤解を招いてしまったと彼女は蒼褪めていた。

熱のため顔を眞赤にして、感動にぶるぶる慄えている戸田はどう考えても久美子が抜きになれる青年ではなかつた。だが

「あれは倦怠期突破のための夫婦の遊戯なのよ」

とは恥づかしくて言えたものではない。久美子が迷つていると戸田は益々燃えあがつた。

「お苦しくても僕が学校を卒業するまで待つていてください。必ず奥さんを幸福にしますから」

と、まばらに髭の生えている鼻下をむくむくと動かしたかとおもうと唇を尖らせ接吻しようとした。

久美子は置いてあるバケツを取るふりをして腰をかがめ、辛うじて戸田の接吻を避けた。

「よろしくお願いするわね」

と口の中で言つて階下へかけおりたときどきどきする乳房を抱いて鏡台の前に倒れ、肩で息をしていた。

戸田の熱病のような好意もいづれは醒めることだろう。今はそれをしぜんに待つより他に仕方がなかつた。

しかしこのことを夫に語つた場合、本当に嫉妬した夫との夜のいとなみの激しさが久美子にはありありと感じられ、戸田よりそのほうに、此頃の彼女は少々疲労を覚えているのであつた。

―おわり―

「私が女学生の修学旅行に東京から日光へ行った時のことだったわ。別クラスの子で先生に犯された人がいたのよ。旅館ではなくて散歩に出た河原でだったけれども。……『痛いッ!!』と突然草の陰で声がしたので、同じように散歩していた女の子は怖くなって逃げ帰って来たら、それがそうだったんですって。あれ、どうかしら？」

「なるほど、そんなことも世の中にはあるのかね。それに賛成するよ」

久美子は立ち上がって電灯を消した。想像の世界をより豊富に明るくするためだった。久美子は清楚な処女に扮して男に甘え、男の心が獣性となって伸びてきた時、人生の汚濁を見たように叫び、ひとり逃げた。

胸が波打ち弾んでいた。男は一気に慕い寄り、空想の世界で甘美な夢を追っていた。

意外にもその体は初々しい触感に満ち満ちて、征服の熱望をかき立てるのであった。強引に圧倒していく逞しい男の生活力を自覚して、久しぶりに誠一は満足した。

誠一と久美子の夫婦生活にそうして青春が戻ってきた。しかし、いつまでも教師と女学生でもないと思い、電灯をつけてもできる趣向を考えた。その頃ちょうど戸田は夏休みになって鳥取へ帰省していたので、それを利用し、いつか夫が下宿人と妻との不倫な関係を疑って妻を折檻することにした。いくら騒いでも聞かれる者のない気楽さから、

「戸田とどんなことをしたか、その口から聞いてやる」

とか

「戸田と良いことをしたここが憎らしい」

などと戸田護の名前が毎夜繰り返された。何も知らない戸田こそ災難である。この遊戯の方法は尽きず、一夏を久美子たちは十分に堪能して過ごした。

そのためもあろうか、久美子は近頃自分が本当に戸田護が好きになっているような錯覚に陥るのである。戸田の部屋にいて立ち去り難い原因もそれであった。

三、誤　解

足音がして現実に戸田が帰ってきていたのに、久美子は気づかなかった。

「なあんだ奥さんでしたか。誰かと思いました。今日は朝の講義だけで、あとはズボラです」

戸田の声に、はじめて掃除をやりかけてぼんやりしていた自分に気づき、久美子は慌てるのであった。

「あらあら、私お掃除の途中で居眠りしていたわ。あなたのお部屋、風がよく通って気持ちいいものですから」

久美子が照れ隠しを言いながら立ち上がるその手を、戸田は勢いよく掴んだ。

「奥さん、事情は皆裏の山崎君から聞いています。僕が休暇で帰っていた間、奥さんは御主人から、僕との仲に肉体関係があると疑われて責めさいなまれていたそうじゃありませんか。しかも奥さんははっきり僕のことを好きだと言明なさっていたそうで、戸田はどんなに感激したか。山崎と抱き合って泣いたくらいです」

戸田がぎゅうぎゅう握ってくる手首が痛いので、久美子ははらはらと涙を流した。

戸田はそれを邪推して一層感激するのである。夫婦の睦言を隣家の息子が聞いていたのだ。遊戯のヤマを効果的にするために「戸田が好きだ」と言った記憶も久美子にあった。これは大変な誤解を招いてしまったと彼女は青褪めていた。

熱のため顔を真っ赤にして、感動にぶるぶる震えている戸田は、どう考えても久美子が夢中になれる青年ではなかった。だが、

「あれは倦怠期突破のための夫婦の遊戯なのよ」

とは恥ずかしくて言えたものではない。久美子が迷っていると、戸田はますます燃え上がった。

「お苦しくても僕が学校を卒業するまで待っていてください。必ず奥さんを幸せにしますから」

と、まばらに髭の生えている鼻下をむくむくと動かしたかと思うと、唇を尖らせ接吻しようとした。

久美子は置いてあるバケツを取るふりをして腰をかがめ、辛うじて戸田の接吻を避けた。

「よろしくお願いするわね」

と口の中で言って階下へ駆け下りた。ドキドキする乳房を抱いて鏡台の前に倒れ、肩で息をしていた。

戸田の熱病のような好意も、いずれは冷めることだろう。今はそれを自然に待つより他に仕方がなかった。

しかし、このことを夫に語った場合、本当に嫉妬した夫との夜の営みの激しさが久美子にはありありと感じられ、戸田よりその方に、この頃の彼女は少々疲労を覚えているのであった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Me, schoolgirl of school trip to Tokyo from Nikko to go when time was. Different class's child with teacher by violated person existed. Inn not but walk out went riverbank at was although. ... 'Painful!!' and suddenly grass's shade at voice did because, same way walking was girls afraid became run home came, that was so it is said. That, how?"

"Indeed such thing also world in exists I wonder. That, agree I do."

Kumiko stood up light turned off. Imagination's world more richly brightly make for was. Kumiko pure virgin into transform man to flirt, man's heart bestiality becoming stretched out time, life's pollution seen like scream alone fled.

Chest was waving bouncing. Man at once yearned close imagination's world in sweet dream was chasing.

Unexpectedly that body young-and-fresh touch filled with, conquest's burning-desire stirred up. Forcibly overwhelming vigorous man's life-force realizing, after long time Seiichi was satisfied.

Seiichi and Kumiko's married life in thus youth returned. However, forever teacher and schoolgirl not being think, light turned on even can variety thought. That time exactly Toda summer vacation became Tottori to homecoming had done because of that think, someday, husband boarder and wife with immoral relationship suspecting wife punish decided. No matter how much make noise heard person not-having ease from,

"Toda with what-kind-of thing did that mouth from hear I will"

or

"Toda with good thing did here is hateful"

etc. Toda Mamoru's name every night repeated was. Anything not-knowing Toda indeed disaster is. This play's method not-exhausting one summer Kumiko [and husband] fully enjoyed spent.

For that reason perhaps, Kumiko recently herself truly Toda Mamoru becoming like illusion falls into. Toda's room in being leave-hard reason also that was.

3. Misunderstanding

Footsteps doing reality in Toda returned had come although Kumiko noticed not.

"Oh, Madam was it. Someone I thought. Today morning's lecture only, after that lazy is."

Toda's voice at first-time cleaning starting-to-do absent-mindedly was herself noticed Kumiko flustered was.

"Oh my, I cleaning's middle at dozing was. Your room wind well passes through pleasant thing because."

Kumiko bashfulness-hiding saying while standing up that hand Toda vigorously grabbed.

"Madam, circumstances all back-of Yamazaki-kun from hearing am. I vacation for returning was interval, Madam husband from, me with relationship fleshly relationship exists being suspected tormented being was so is it not? Moreover Madam clearly me thing like statement was-making so, Toda how much moved was. Yamazaki and embracing cried degree is."

Toda tightly-tightly gripping coming wrist painful because Kumiko tears-tears tears shed.

Toda that misinterpret even-more moved is. Married-couple's pillow-talk next-house's son hearing was. Play's peak effectively make for "Toda like" said memory also Kumiko had. This terrible misunderstanding invited had ended-up and she pale-faced was.

Heat because-of face bright-red make, emotion in trembling-trembling shivering Toda no-matter-how think Kumiko dream-of could youth was not. But,

"That ennui breakthrough for married-couple's play is"

as-for shy was-not-able-to-say thing is. Kumiko hesitating Toda more-and-more burned-up.

"Painful-though-it-be me school graduate until wait please. Surely Madam happy will-make because"

and, sparsely hair growing nose-under twitching moved think then lips pointed kiss try-to-do.

Kumiko placed bucket take pretense do waist bend, barely Toda's kiss avoided.

"Favorably please I-ask"

and mouth inside said downstairs ran-down. Thumping-thumping breasts holding mirror-stand front fall, shoulder-breathing doing was.

Toda's fever-like favor eventually cool down will. Now that naturally wait than other way-not-exist.

However this thing husband to told case, truly jealous-became husband with night's activity's intensity Kumiko to clearly felt, Toda than that way, these-days she little fatigue feeling was.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"It was back when I was a schoolgirl on a trip from Tokyo to Nikko. A girl from another class was violated by a teacher. It didn't happen at the inn, but out on the riverbank during a walk. Someone said they heard a sudden cry of 'It hurts!!' from behind the grass, and when the other girls who were walking nearby got scared and ran back, that’s what they found out had happened. What do you think of that?"

"I see, I suppose such things do happen in this world. I’m in favor of that roleplay."

Kumiko stood up and switched off the light. It was to make their world of imagination richer and more vivid. Kumiko transformed herself into a pure, innocent maiden and acted coyly with her husband. When his heart turned carnal and his desires reached for her, she would scream as if she had glimpsed the filth of the world and flee from him.

Her heart was pounding. Her husband, Seiichi, pursued her at once, chasing a sweet dream in their shared fantasy.

Unexpectedly, her body felt fresh and youthful to the touch, stirring in him a burning desire for conquest. Feeling the surge of a vigorous, domineering masculinity, Seiichi felt satisfied for the first time in a long while.

Thus, youth returned to the married life of Seiichi and Kumiko. However, realizing they couldn't play "teacher and schoolgirl" forever, they devised a new scenario they could perform even with the lights on. It was then they thought of Toda, their boarder, who had gone home to Tottori for summer vacation. They decided the husband would pretend to suspect his wife of having an affair with the boarder and "punish" her for it. Since there was no one around to hear them, they felt at ease.

"I'll make you tell me with your own mouth what you did with Toda!" or "I hate this part of you that did such things with him!"—Toda Mamoru's name was invoked every night. It was a misfortune for the unsuspecting Toda. This game was endless, and Kumiko and her husband spent the summer thoroughly enjoying themselves.

Perhaps because of this, Kumiko had recently begun to fall into the illusion that she actually liked Toda. That was why she found herself lingering in his room.

**III. Misunderstanding**

Kumiko was so lost in thought that she didn't hear Toda's footsteps as he returned.

"Oh, it's you, Ma'am. I wondered who it was. I only had a morning lecture today, so I’m being a bit of a slacker for the rest of the day."

Startled by Toda's voice, Kumiko realized she had been standing there idly with her cleaning supplies.

"Oh my, I must have dozed off while cleaning. Your room gets such a nice breeze; it’s quite pleasant."

As Kumiko stood up, offering a flustered excuse, Toda suddenly grabbed her hand with force.

"Ma'am, I’ve heard everything from young Yamazaki in the back. While I was away on break, weren't you tormented by your husband because he suspected us of having a physical affair? And I heard you even clearly stated that you loved me! You have no idea how moved I was. I even held Yamazaki and wept."

His grip was so tight it hurt, and tears began to spill from Kumiko's eyes.

Misinterpreting her tears, Toda became even more impassioned. It turned out the neighbor's son had been listening to the couple's private roleplay. Kumiko remembered saying "I love Toda" just to make the climax of their game more effective. She turned pale, realizing she had invited a terrible misunderstanding.

Toda stood there, face flushed with heat and body trembling with emotion. He was by no means a young man Kumiko could ever actually be infatuated with. But she couldn't bring herself to say, "That was just a game my husband and I play to overcome the boredom of our marriage." As she hesitated, Toda’s passion only intensified.

"Even if it’s painful, please wait for me until I graduate. I promise I will make you happy."

His sparse mustache twitched under his nose as he puckered his lips, leaning in for a kiss.

Kumiko ducked, pretending to reach for a bucket, and narrowly avoided him.

"I’ll... I’ll be counting on you," she managed to mutter as she fled downstairs. She collapsed in front of her vanity, clutching her thumping chest and gasping for air.

Toda’s feverish affection would surely cool down eventually. For now, she had no choice but to wait for it to pass naturally.

However, she knew that if she told her husband about this, his jealousy—this time real—would result in an even more intense night. These days, that was a prospect that left her feeling more exhausted than Toda's advances ever could.

—The End—

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This appears to be a single-page spread from a "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine or a popular literary monthly.
*   **Typography:** Vertical text (tategaki) with right-to-left flow. The title "恋愛術指南" (Guidance on the Art of Love) is set in a decorative, hand-drawn font with a floral or vine-like border, suggesting a focus on romance and domestic drama.
*   **Layout:**
    *   The title and section header ("三、誤解") create a clear hierarchy.
    *   The illustration is placed at the bottom center/left, drawing the eye after reading the initial columns.
    *   The text is dense but broken up by frequent dialogue markers (brackets).
*   **Illustration:** A charcoal or pencil-style sketch showing a man and woman in a romantic pose. The man’s expression is earnest, while the woman looks slightly distressed or overwhelmed, reflecting the "misunderstanding" mentioned in the text.
*   **Pagination:** The number (47) at the bottom indicates this is part of a larger collection or magazine issue.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely the late 1940s to early 1950s (Early Showa Post-war). The language uses *rekishiteki kana-zukai* (historical kana usage) like "ぢや" for "じゃ" and "恥づかしくて" for "恥ずかしくて," which was phased out after 1946 but persisted in popular literature for some time.
*   **The "Boarder" (Geshukunin) Culture:** In mid-century Japan, it was very common for university students to rent rooms (geshuku) in private family homes. This living arrangement was a frequent trope in literature for "forbidden" attraction between the student and the "Okusan" (the wife/landlady).
*   **Ennui and the "Kasutori" Era:** After the war, there was a boom in magazines that focused on "ero-guro-nansensu" (eroticism, grotesquerie, and nonsense) and domestic drama. The theme of a bored couple using roleplay to spice up their marriage (as mentioned in the text: "倦怠期突破のための夫婦の遊戯") reflects a shift toward more modern, psychological, and frank discussions of sexuality.
*   **Nikko School Trip:** A classic Japanese cultural touchstone; almost every student in the Kanto region went to Nikko for their school trip.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **恋愛術指南 (Ren'aijutsu Shinan):** Guidance/Instruction on the Art of Love. "Shinan" usually refers to instruction in martial arts or traditional crafts, so using it for "romance" is slightly tongue-in-cheek.
*   **倦怠期 (Kentaiki):** The "ennui period" or "rut" in a marriage. A very common term in Japanese drama to describe the point where the initial passion has faded.
*   **下宿人 (Geshukunin):** A lodger or boarder.
*   **折檻 (Sekkan):** To punish or chastise. In this context, it refers to the husband "disciplining" the wife as part of their sexual roleplay.
*   **睦言 (Mutsu-goto):** Pillow talk; intimate conversation between lovers/spouses.
*   **邪推 (Jasui):** To misinterpret someone's motives, usually for the worse (though here Toda misinterprets her tears as love).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Fantasy vs. Reality:** The central conflict arises because Kumiko and Seiichi’s fantasy (the "play") leaks into reality. They use Toda as a prop in their sexual games, but Toda—the reality—responds with genuine (if misguided) emotion.
*   **Domestic Boredom:** The text portrays marriage as something that requires "games" and "roleplay" to survive. The irony is that the cure for her boredom (the game) has created a new, exhausting reality (the boarder's advances and the husband's subsequent genuine jealousy).
*   **The "Vulnerable" Male:** Toda is depicted as somewhat pathetic—mustachioed, trembling, and easily fooled. Kumiko doesn't see him as a romantic hero but as a "disaster" or a "nuisance."
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The wife, Kumiko, is the navigator of both the fantasy and the escape. She orchestrates the roleplay but then has to perform the delicate social dance of rejecting the boarder without revealing the embarrassing truth of her marriage.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Popular Literature (Taishū Bungaku).
*   **Themes:** Romance, Adultery (perceived), Domestic Drama, Roleplay, Misunderstanding, Showa Era, Urban Life.
