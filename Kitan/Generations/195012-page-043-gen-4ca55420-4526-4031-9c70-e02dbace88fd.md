## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

て、良太が素晴らしい本を置いて帰つたこと、素晴らしいコントを書いて居たことが、とても奥様のお気に召したらしいと話した。彼女が素晴らしい意味を知る筈もなかつたが、それに知つて質問を与えた夫人に、良太は、今になにか？　あると、無意識の裡に期待した。あるいは有限マダム攻略戦のコントその儘の到来を夫人は窃かに希つて居るのではあるまいかと思ひ、良太は翌日から古本屋を漁り、為永春水の名作を、或は西鶴の好色一代男を自室の書棚に潜ませて、窃読の形跡を検べる一方、愈々、能動的に暗躍した。
　或る日、良太が出勤した後、頼まれたシャツを洗濯して居た女中は、ポケツトの中から異様なものを発見して、夫人の許に差出した。田舎出の純心な処女は、それが何の目的のために使うものか判断がつかなかつたが、夫人は顔を赧らめるより、良太の青春に同情した。無理もないと思つた。と同時に、何故かその儘放つて置けない嫉妬と焦燥を身内に感じた。
　良太はその夜、マダムに誘われて、今晩は飲み明かしませんかと言つて、上等のウ井スキーを出された。彼も飲めば、飲める口なので、マダムを相手に晩く迄飲んだ。酔いが廻るにしたがつて、今晩こそ？　と彼は不逞な肚を据えた。
「ねえ、ママさん」いつか呼名も奥さんからママさんと親しくなつていた。
「なあに……」
「今夜は少し失礼を云つてもかまいませんか」「エーエ、いいですとも、貴男の失礼、訊いてみたいワ」
「ママさんは、御主人はほんとに無いのか？」
「御存じの通りですワ、誰か主人らしい人此の家に居て？　三毛まで、女よ」
「それは判つてますよ。でも、そんなに美しくて若くて、絶対に一人つて法はないと思うなア、御主人で悪かつたら、愛人は？　怒る？　こんなこと云つたら」
「いいえ、怒りません。でも何故そんなこと訊くの？」
「気になるんです、僕、ママさんが好きなもんですから」
「どんなに好き？」
「もう目茶苦茶に好きなんです」
「大分酔つたのね、もつと軀をチヤンとなさい、インチキよそんなの」
「チヨツトぐらいママさんに触らせて下さいよ」
　良太は酔つた勢いを借りる訳ではなかつたが、どうしてもこんな雰囲気に左らざるを得ない夫人の魅力であつた。

**オールド・ミスと呼ばれて、誰も相手にして呉れなかつた彼女ではあつたが、老巧な男の誘いにかゝつては、他愛もなく堰を切つた。**

　彼女は或る会社の経理課に勤めて居る。
　勤続十五年と言えば新陳代謝の激しいこの頃の会社では珍らしい存在である。経理課の仕事は、矢張り熟練と経験が物を言うのでその點、腰のすわつた彼女の勤務振りは、会社でもなかなか高く評価されて、重役の御覚えも目出たい方であるのだが、それだけに、同僚の若い社員の間では余り人気がない。
　それは、三十と言う年齢のせいもある。
　器量だつて、それ程、醜いと言う程ではないのだが、愛嬌のない、少し大きな顔の造作の粗末さが、社交的でない陰気な性格にも裏附けられて、冷ややかにそつけなく固つて、その上に結婚適齢期を過ぎた諦めのひびが、一層に彼女の日常の挙措を、乾からびたものにして居た。
　彼女の今日までの青春の経過の間に、一度や二度の縁談がなかつた譯でもない。目立たない日陰の陰花植物みたいな彼女ではた。
「今日は、何もかも聞きますよ。よござんすか。おかぐは？」
「どうぞ、何でもお訊きなさい、ボーヤ」マダムも態度がはぐれるにつれて、軽い調子になつて行つた。
「一体、全体ですね、凡そ世の中ですね、とにかく、こんな世相がですねあゝ面倒だ、一体、ママさんの生活法の道は？……どう云うことに……失礼……だつた？」
「ばかね、そんなこと、あんたは心配しなくていいの、おませね、子供のクセに」
「子供？……子供と仰言いましたね、どうせ僕は子供です、でもね、ママさん、子供は……」
「バカね、何ママの前で昂奮してんの手を離しなさいな、駄目、駄目、バカよ」
「おとなですよ。僕はおとなですよ」
　男女の礼儀とは、紙一重である。
　この場合までの夫人は、あの品の良い夫人であり、この場合までの良太は立派なゼントルマンである。だが、今の夫人はこうであり、今の良太はこうである。紙一重の奥の人間の姿である。アルコールは、粋な月下氷人である。
「良ちゃん、あんた、うちの眞弓嫌い？」
「きらい？　あんないいお嬢さんを、嫌いな男があるでしょうか」
「実はね、あの広告はね」
「判つてますつたら、お嬢さんの、未来の良人を選ぶための……でしょう」
「まあ……判つていた？」
「いましたとも、何も彼も……ママさん」
「で、眞弓をどう思う？　貴男の方は引越して下さると同時に、失礼ですが身元を調べさせて頂いたし」
「ヤボなこと、云いつこなし、それより、ママ、僕、可愛がつてよ」
「ママの方がいいの？　変つてんのね、今の青年つて」
「変りもしますよ、日本帝國が敗けてるのに、日本青年の気質が変らなかつた。あつたが、それでも極盛りにを時におせつかいをやらく人も居たし、手を握つたり、お尻を撫つたり、悪戯山戯に誘いかけて小當りに責任のない誘惑を試みた男もないではなかつたが、凛とした癖みたいな彼女の肉体には遂に今日まで、火が點かず仕舞だつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

..., Ryota having left a wonderful book and returning, and having written a wonderful "conte" (short story), seemed to have very much pleased the Madam, it was told. She had no way of knowing the wonderful meaning, but toward the Madam who knew that and gave questions, Ryota, "Now, will something [happen]?" he unconsciously expected. Or perhaps the arrival of a conte exactly like "A Strategy Battle for a Bored Madam" was what the Madam was secretly wishing for, he thought; Ryota from the next day scavenged second-hand bookstores, hiding Tamenaga Shunsui's masterpieces or Saikaku's *Life of an Amorous Man* in his room's bookshelf, and while checking for signs of secret reading, he finally actively moved in the shadows.

One day, after Ryota went to work, the maid who was washing the shirt she was asked to do discovered something strange in the pocket and presented it to the Madam. The pure virgin from the countryside did not understand for what purpose it was used, but the Madam, rather than blushing, felt sympathy for Ryota's youth. She thought it was only natural. At the same time, for some reason she felt jealousy and frustration within herself that she could not just leave it alone.

That night, Ryota was invited by the Madam, who said "Shall we drink through the night tonight?" and was served high-quality whiskey. Since he was a person who could drink if he drank, he drank with the Madam until late. As the intoxication circulated, "Tonight for sure?" he settled his audacious stomach.
"Hey, Mama-san," at some point the name changed from "Okusan" to "Mama-san" and became intimate.
"What is it...?"
"Is it okay if I say something a bit rude tonight?" "Eh, it's fine, your rudeness, I want to try hearing it."
"Mama-san, do you really have no husband?"
"It's as you know. Is there anyone who seems like a husband in this house? Even the calico cat is female."
"I know that. But, being so beautiful and young, I don't think there's any rule that you must absolutely be alone. If not a husband, a lover? Are you angry? If I say such a thing."
"No, I'm not angry. But why do you ask such a thing?"
"I'm curious. Because I like you, Mama-san."
"How much do you like me?"
"I like you just crazily."
"You've gotten quite drunk. Fix your body more properly. That's a sham."
"Please let me touch you just a little, Mama-san."
Ryota was not borrowing the momentum of being drunk, but it was the charm of the Madam that forced him into such an atmosphere.

**She was called an "Old Miss" and was someone no one would partner with, but caught by the invitation of a crafty man, she easily burst the floodgates.**

She works in the accounting department of a certain company.
Fifteen years of service is a rare existence in companies these days where turnover is intense. In accounting work, skill and experience talk, so in that regard, her settled way of working is highly evaluated in the company, and her reputation among the executives is good, but for that reason, she is not very popular among the young employees.
That is also because of the age of thirty.
Her looks aren't so ugly as to be called that, but the crudeness of her somewhat large facial features, backed by an unsocial and gloomy personality, froze coldly and bluntly, and on top of that, the cracks of resignation from passing the marriageable age made her daily behavior even more dried up.

During the progress of her youth until today, it's not that there weren't one or two marriage proposals. Although she was like an inconspicuous shade plant in the shadows, even so, during her peak there were people who meddled, and there were men who squeezed her hand, stroked her behind, or tried irresponsible temptations as a prank, but in her body, which was like a dignified habit, until today, no fire had been lit.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The news that Ryota had left behind a wonderful book and had written an impressive short story seemed to have piqued the Madam’s interest. Though she couldn't have grasped the deeper implications, her inquisitive reaction led Ryota to hope—perhaps subconsciously—that something was finally about to happen. He wondered if she was secretly anticipating a scenario straight out of his "Strategies for a Bored Madam" story. From the next day, Ryota began scouring second-hand bookstores, stashing erotic classics by Tamenaga Shunsui and Ihara Saikaku’s *The Life of an Amorous Man* on his shelves. While keeping an eye out for signs that she had been sneaking a look at them, he began his active maneuvers in the shadows.

One morning after Ryota had left for work, the maid, while doing the laundry he’d requested, discovered a peculiar object in his shirt pocket and brought it to the Madam. A naive girl from the countryside, she had no idea what it was for, but the Madam, rather than being shocked, felt a pang of sympathy for Ryota’s youthful urges. She told herself it was only natural. Yet, at the same time, she felt a flicker of jealousy and a strange restlessness she couldn’t quite ignore.

That night, the Madam invited Ryota for drinks. "Shall we drink until dawn?" she suggested, pouring him a glass of premium whiskey. Ryota, being a capable drinker himself, stayed up late matching her glass for glass. As the alcohol took hold, he steeled his nerves: *Tonight's the night.*
"Say, Mama-san," he began. Somewhere along the line, the formal "Okusan" had shifted to the more intimate "Mama-san."
"Yes...?"
"Would you mind if I was a little forward tonight?"
"My, not at all. I’d love to hear just how forward you can be."
"Mama-san... do you really not have a husband?"
"As you can see. Is there anyone here who looks like a husband? Even the cat is a girl."
"I know that. But someone as beautiful and young as you... surely you aren't truly alone. If not a husband, surely a lover? Are you angry with me for asking?"
"No, I’m not angry. But why the sudden curiosity?"
"I can't help it. I'm quite fond of you, Mama-san."
"And how fond are we talking?"
"I'm madly in love with you."
"You're just drunk. Sit up straight; you're being ridiculous."
"Just let me touch you, just a little..."
It wasn't merely the alcohol talking; Ryota found himself genuinely pulled in by the Madam’s irresistible allure.

***

**Labeled an "Old Miss" and ignored by all, she had finally burst the floodgates of her heart when faced with the advances of a practiced seducer.**

She works in the accounting department of a firm where she has been for fifteen years—a rare feat in an era of such high corporate turnover. Because accounting relies heavily on experience and diligence, her steadfast work ethic is highly valued by her superiors. However, this same dedication makes her unpopular among the younger staff.
Part of it is her age; she is thirty.
While she isn't exactly unattractive, her features are somewhat coarse and lacking in charm. Combined with her unsociable, gloomy temperament, she presents a cold, blunt exterior. Having long since passed the typical age for marriage, a sense of resignation has settled over her, making her daily movements seem brittle and drained of life.

It isn't that she never had suitors or marriage prospects in her youth. Even for a woman who lived like a plant in the shadows, there were always those who meddled during her prime—men who would squeeze her hand, brush against her, or try their luck with irresponsible advances. Yet, her body remained like a fortress of dignified indifference; until this day, no one had managed to strike a spark within her.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** The text is presented in a traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tategaki*). It is divided into two primary columns.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard serif typeface typical of mid-century printing. The sub-header in the center of the page is set in a **bold, larger font** and enclosed in decorative borders (scalloped lines), which serves as a "hook" or a transition between two different sections or stories.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The bold center text acts as a focal point, breaking the monotony of the dense columns. The page number "(44)" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Dialogue is enclosed in traditional Japanese quotation marks (「 」). Ellipses are used frequently to denote hesitation or suggestive pauses in the conversation.
*   **Column Structure:** The right column features a dialogue-heavy scene between "Ryota" and a "Madam." The left column shifts into a more descriptive, narrative prose style focusing on the "Old Miss" character.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Era (Late 1940s-1950s):** The text mentions "Since the Japanese Empire was defeated" (日本帝國が敗けて), placing the setting in the immediate post-war period. This was a time of shifting moralities, where traditional values clashed with new, often more liberal or "decadent" westernized influences.
*   **"Old Miss" (オールド・ミス):** This is a Japanese loanword (wasei-eigo) for a spinster. In the 1950s, a woman of 30 was considered well past her "expiry date" for marriage (the "Christmas cake" metaphor—unsellable after the 25th—was a later but related concept).
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The suggestive tone, the mention of "unspoken" objects in pockets (likely contraceptives), and the focus on "Mamas" and "Madams" are hallmarks of *Kasutori* magazines—cheap, pulp publications that thrived during the occupation, focusing on gossip, erotica, and light fiction.
*   **Literary References:** Mentioning Ihara Saikaku (*Life of an Amorous Man*) and Tamenaga Shunsui (known for *ninjyobon* or romantic/erotic fiction) serves as a shorthand for the characters' interest in eroticism and the "floating world" aesthetics.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **コント (Conte):** Derived from the French, meaning a very short story or sketch. In post-war Japan, it often referred to humorous or satirical short fiction.
*   **月下氷人 (Gekka Hyojin):** A traditional idiom for a matchmaker (lit. "The man under the moon and the man on the ice"). Here, it's used metaphorically to say that alcohol acted as the matchmaker.
*   **有閑マダム (Yukan Madam):** "Leisured Madam." Refers to wealthy, upper-class wives with too much time on their hands, a common archetype in mid-century Japanese erotica and soap operas.
*   **堰を切った (Seki o kitta):** "Burst the dam/floodgates." An idiom meaning to lose emotional control or to suddenly let out long-suppressed feelings.
*   **三毛 (Mike):** A calico cat. The dialogue uses this to emphasize the lack of any male presence in the house.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Sexual Liberation vs. Repression:** The "Old Miss" character represents the repressed, "dried up" traditional worker, while the interaction between Ryota and the Madam represents the burgeoning, somewhat cynical sexual freedom of the post-war era.
*   **The "Paper-Thin" Nature of Morality:** The text explicitly states that the "manners" of a lady and a gentleman are only "paper-thin," easily dissolved by alcohol to reveal the "true" human form beneath.
*   **Post-War Cynicism:** The dialogue about the Empire's defeat leading to a change in the "spirit of Japanese youth" reflects a common theme in *buraiha* (decadent school) literature—the idea that the old nationalistic virtues were dead, replaced by hedonism or individual desire.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The text plays with the "predatory" nature of young men (Ryota) and the "boredom" of older women, while also pitying the woman who "missed her chance" at traditional happiness.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Fiction (*Kasutori*).
*   **Primary Themes:** Romance, Eroticism, Post-war Social Change, Gender Roles, Aging.
*   **Tone:** Suggestive, Cynical, Melodramatic, Observational.
*   **Classification:** Adult/Mature (due to suggestive themes and historical context of pulp magazines).
