This text appears to be a literary essay or a piece of narrative non-fiction from a mid-20th century Japanese magazine. It describes a group of high-spirited factory girls (jokō) who lived in a dormitory and were notorious for playfully "attacking" and teasing young men who tried to cross a bridge near their workplace.

## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

ちやない。たいていの男は一度この娘子軍の襲来に遇えば、降参して二度とこの橋を通らなくなる。
　それからあらぬか、此の頃では、餘り此の橋を通る男もなく、彼女達も手持無沙汰をかこつているとか。それで若し、風来坊が何にかの拍子に引つ懸かることがあると、餓えた獏の様に、「次は妾の番だよ、次は妾だよ、」とばかり仲間同士でも喧嘩が起る位だから、鴨になつた男こそいゝ災難である。
　私は此の話を聞いていて、我れこそはと言つて、その娘子軍の挑戦に應ずる豪の者が居らないかなあ、と思つたが、件の青年達は、別に知つた顔でもないので、話しかけることも出来ず黙つていると、彼等は揃つて、その店を出て行つた。
　それから暫くは仕事の事で、東西奔走、忙しくしていたので、ついそんな事も忘れていたが、愈々明日この街を撥つて次の旅にうつると言う日の解、私はブラリと宿を出ると噂の工場の方へ足を向けた。
　前にも言つたように、私は年中旅をしていて諸國のいろいろ面白い風習や行事なんかを、實際に見分していたし、その方面の道にかけても敢えて人後に落ちぬつもりであつたから物は経験だ、一度位娘達にかつがれて思う存分さいたまれるのも一興だと、つまらぬ事を考えて出かけてきた。
　川に沿つて歩いてゆくと十丁ばかりで、その工場に達した。噂に言う橋の袂まで来たが、一向に人の気配がしない。寄宿舎の窓口から明るい電燈の光りと、なましい人聲が聞えてくるから間違いはない筈である。
　その附近を、グルリ一歩き廻つたが、遂にそんな目に遇うこともなかつたので、一ぱいかつがれたかなと思つて、そのまま歸途についた。
　途中の八百屋で果物を買つて一寸耳に挟んだ話から、今日のことも、うなづけた。
　それは二日前の夜であつた。
　大分長い間、不漁が續いて、燃え上る情熱の焔を慰やすのに困つていた彼女達のなかへ、ひよつくりと、二十才前後の美しい男が、餌食となつて撥ぎ込まれた。男気の切れていた時だから、猫に鰹節のたとえ、あつちからも、こつちからもと、引つ張られ、抓られ、ひつかかれ、その男は必死になつて抵抗したものの、から、服は破れるし眼鏡はとぶ、ズボンも破れ又もズクズクにされて、遂に半死半生で累の中へころがされた。
　あまりやり方が、ひどいといふ事から刑事問題となつて、その工場の責任者が監督不行届を問われて始末書をとられると言つた事件になつた。
　そんなことから、彼女達は當分禁足を命ぜられて、橋の上まで涼みに出かける事が出来なくなつた。
　私がその問題の橋の上へ散歩に出かけたのは、彼女達が工場の柵外より出ることが出来なくなつてからであつた。
　今から考えてみると、私にとつて幸いであつたかも知れない。若し二三日早かつたならば、私がそんな目に遇つているかも知れないからである。

じゃない。たいていの男は一度この娘子軍（じょうしぐん）の襲来に遭えば、降参して二度とこの橋を通らなくなる。
　それからであろうか、この頃では、あまりこの橋を通る男もなく、彼女たちも手持ち無沙汰をかこっているとか。それで、もし風来坊が何かの拍子に引っかかることがあると、飢えた獏（ばく）のように、「次は私の番だよ、次は私だよ」とばかりに仲間同士でも喧嘩が起きるくらいだから、カモになった男こそいい災難である。
　私はこの話を聞いていて、我こそはと言ってその娘子軍の挑戦に応ずる豪の者はいないかなあと思ったが、件（くだん）の青年たちは別に知った顔でもないので、話しかけることもできず黙っていると、彼らは揃ってその店を出て行った。
　それからしばらくは仕事のことで東西奔走し、忙しくしていたので、ついそんなことも忘れていたが、いよいよ明日この街を去って次の旅に移るという日の夕方、私はぶらりと宿を出ると、噂の工場の方へ足を向けた。
　前にも言ったように、私は年中旅をしていて、諸国のいろいろ面白い風習や行事などを実際に見聞していたし、その方面の道にかけてもあえて人後に落ちぬつもりであったから、「物は経験だ、一度くらい娘たちに担がれて思う存分いたぶられるのも一興だ」と、つまらぬことを考えて出かけてきた。
　川に沿って歩いて行くと十丁（じっちょ）ばかりで、その工場に達した。噂に言う橋の袂（たもと）まで来たが、一向に人の気配がしない。寄宿舎の窓から明るい電灯の光と、騒がしい人声が聞こえてくるから間違いはないはずである。
　その付近をぐるりと一回り歩いたが、ついにそんな目に遭うこともなかったので、一杯食わされたかなと思って、そのまま帰途についた。
　途中の八百屋で果物を買って、ちょっと耳に挟んだ話から、今日のことも合点がいった。
　それは二日前の夜であった。
　だいぶ長い間「不漁」が続いて、燃え上がる情熱の炎を慰めるのに困っていた彼女たちの中へ、ひょっくりと二十歳前後の美しい男が、餌食（えじき）となって放り込まれた。男気が切れていた時だから、「猫に鰹節」のたとえ通り、あっちからもこっちからもと引っ張られ、つねられ、ひっかかれ、その男は必死になって抵抗したものの、服は破れるし眼鏡は飛ぶ、ズボンも破られ、ずたずたにされて、ついに半死半生で塵（ごみ）の中へ転がされた。
　あまりにやり方がひどいということで刑事問題となり、その工場の責任者が監督不行き届きを問われて、始末書を取られるという事件になった。
　そんなことから、彼女たちは当分「禁足」を命じられて、橋の上まで涼みに出かけることができなくなった。
　私がその問題の橋の上へ散歩に出かけたのは、彼女たちが工場の柵外へ出ることができなくなってからであった。
　今から考えてみると、私にとって幸いであったかもしれない。もし二、三日早かったならば、私がそんな目に遭っていたかもしれないからである。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

It is not so. Most men, once they encounter a raid of this "Amazon army," surrender and never pass this bridge a second time.
Perhaps because of that, these days, not many men pass this bridge, and they (the girls) are reportedly complaining of having nothing to do. Therefore, if a wanderer happens by some chance to get caught, like hungry tapirs, "Next is my turn! Next is mine!"—to the extent that fights break out even among comrades—for the man who becomes the "duck" (easy target), it is a fine disaster indeed.
I, listening to this story, wondered if there wasn't some brave soul who would say "I am the one" and take on the challenge of that Amazon army, but since the young men in question were not familiar faces, I couldn't speak to them and remained silent, and they all left the shop together.
After that, for a while, because of work, I was running east and west and being busy, so I accidentally forgot such things, but on the evening of the day I was finally to leave this town and move to the next journey, I idly left the inn and turned my feet toward the rumored factory.
As I said before, I travel all year round and have been actually observing various interesting customs and events of various provinces, and regarding that field of expertise I intended not to fall behind others, so thinking "It's all experience; it might be fun to be teased by the girls once and be toyed with to their hearts' content," I went out thinking such trivial things.
Walking along the river, in about ten *cho*, I reached that factory. I came to the foot of the bridge of rumor, but there was no sign of people at all. Since bright electric light and noisy human voices come from the dormitory windows, there is no mistake.
I walked around that vicinity once, but in the end I never met such an experience, so thinking I might have been fooled/teased (by the rumor), I set out on the way back.
Buying fruit at a greengrocer on the way, from a story I happened to overhear, today's situation became understandable.
That was two nights ago.
For a considerably long time, "poor fishing" (lack of targets) had continued, and into the midst of those girls who were having trouble soothing the flames of rising passion, suddenly, a beautiful man around twenty years old was thrown in as prey. Because it was a time when "male energy" was cut off, like the proverb "bonito flakes to a cat," from here and from there he was pulled, pinched, and scratched; although the man resisted desperately, his clothes were torn, his glasses flew off, his pants were torn and shredded, and finally, in a state of half-dead, half-alive, he was rolled into the trash.
Because the method was too harsh, it became a criminal matter, and the factory manager was questioned for lack of supervision and ended up having to submit a formal apology (shimatsho).
Because of such things, they were ordered "confinement" for the time being, and they became unable to go out to the bridge to enjoy the evening cool.
The time I went out for a walk on that problematic bridge was after they had become unable to go outside the factory fence.
Thinking about it now, it might have been fortunate for me. If it had been two or three days earlier, I might have been the one meeting such an experience.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

It’s no exaggeration to say that most men, after suffering just one "raid" by this local "Amazon army," would surrender on the spot and never set foot on that bridge again. Perhaps word has gotten around, for these days few men venture across, and the girls are said to be languishing in boredom. If a lone wanderer should happen to wander into their clutches, they fall upon him like a pack of starving beasts. "It's my turn next!" "No, mine!"—they’ll even start brawling amongst themselves. For the poor soul who becomes their "sitting duck," it is a catastrophe of the highest order.

Listening to this tale in a shop, I wondered if there wasn't some bold fellow willing to take up the gauntlet against these girls. However, as the young men discussing it were strangers, I remained silent, and they soon left the establishment together. I became swept up in the frantic pace of my own work for a while and the story slipped my mind. But on my final evening in town before moving on to my next destination, I found myself wandering out of my inn and heading toward the notorious factory.

As I’ve mentioned, I spend my life traveling and pride myself on having a keen eye for the peculiar customs and folkways of the provinces. "It’s all part of the experience," I told myself. "It might even be a bit of fun to let those girls have their way with me for once." With such foolish thoughts in head, I set off.

I walked about a kilometer along the river until the factory came into view. I reached the foot of the infamous bridge, but the area was eerily deserted. There was no mistaking the location, though—bright electric lights spilled from the dormitory windows, accompanied by a cacophony of female voices. I circled the area once, but having encountered nothing out of the ordinary, I assumed the rumors had been an exaggeration and began my walk back.

The mystery was solved when I stopped to buy some fruit at a greengrocer. From the gossip I overheard there, the reality of the situation came into focus. It had happened just two nights prior.

After a long "dry spell" with no victims in sight, a handsome young man of about twenty had inadvertently wandered right into their midst. Starved for male company, the girls pounced like cats on a bowl of bonito flakes. They pulled, pinched, and clawed at him from every direction. The poor man fought back desperately, but to no avail; his clothes were shredded, his glasses went flying, and his trousers were torn to ribbons. In the end, he was left crumpled in the dirt, half-dead from the ordeal.

The "attack" was deemed so excessive that it became a police matter. The factory manager was held responsible for a lack of supervision and forced to sign a formal letter of apology. Consequently, the girls had been placed under strict confinement and forbidden from gathering on the bridge to enjoy the evening breeze.

It turns out that by the time I took my "bold" stroll across that bridge, the girls were already locked behind the factory gates. Reflecting on it now, I suppose I should consider myself lucky. Had I arrived just two or three days earlier, I might very well have been the one left in tatters.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page features a large, expressive illustration at the top, occupying nearly half the vertical space. Below the illustration, the text is arranged in three columns, read from right to left (tategaki).
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style typical of 1940s-1950s printing. It uses some older kanji forms (like 餘 for 余, 實 for 実, 應 for 応).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration serves as the primary hook, depicting the "chaos" of the girls' social environment. The page number "— 25 —" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Illustration Style:** The artwork is done in a loose, ink-wash or charcoal-like sketch style. It portrays a group of women (and perhaps the "beautiful man" mentioned in the text) in various poses—some laughing, some looking towards the viewer, some entangled. It conveys a sense of ribaldry and energetic youth.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (late 1940s - 1950s):** The language and the theme of factory dormitories suggest the early post-war period. This was a time when Japan was industrializing rapidly, and young women from rural areas moved to cities to work in textile and manufacturing plants, living in strictly managed company dormitories (*kishukusha*).
*   **娘子軍 (Joshigun):** Literally "Daughter/Girl Army." While it has historical roots (referring to female warriors like those in the Taiping Rebellion), here it is used colloquially and humorously to describe a rowdy, unified group of young women.
*   **Jokō (Factory Girls):** The lives of these women were often depicted in literature as tragic (e.g., *Ah, the Nomugi Pass*), but this text offers a different, more mischievous perspective where the girls exert a chaotic, collective power over the "outside world" represented by the men crossing the bridge.
*   **Social Conventions:** The idea of "cooling off" (*suzumi*) on a bridge was a common summer evening social activity. The bridge serves as a liminal space between the controlled environment of the factory/dormitory and the public world.
*   **"Neko ni Katsuobushi" (Bonito flakes to a cat):** A proverb meaning to place something irresistible in front of someone who cannot help themselves, or a situation of extreme temptation.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **手持無沙汰 (Temochi-busata):** To have nothing to do; to be bored or at a loose end.
*   **風来坊 (Fūraibō):** A wanderer, a person with no fixed destination, or a drifter.
*   **鴨 (Kamo):** Literally "duck," but slang for a "sitting duck," an easy target, or someone easily deceived/victimized.
*   **東西奔走 (Tōzai-honsō):** To be extremely busy, rushing here and there (literally "running east and west").
*   **十丁 (Jiccho):** An old unit of distance. 1 *cho* is approximately 109 meters, so 10 *cho* is roughly 1.1 kilometers.
*   **半死半生 (Hanshi-hanshō):** Half-dead; in a state of extreme physical distress.
*   **禁足 (Kinsoku):** Confinement; being grounded or forbidden from leaving a specific area (often used in military or school contexts).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Gender Roles Reversal:** The text playfully subverts the idea of women as passive or victims. Here, the women are the aggressors, and the man is the "prey" (*ejiki*).
*   **Collective Identity:** The girls act as a single unit (*Joshigun*), suggesting that their strength and mischief come from their shared living conditions and solidarity in the face of boring, repetitive factory work.
*   **Traveler as Observer:** The narrator positions himself as a "sophisticated observer" of local customs, though he admits his own foolish curiosity. There is a sense of "urban traveler" looking at the "raw" life of the working class.
*   **Post-war Vitality:** Despite the "criminal problem" mentioned, the tone is light and humorous, reflecting a certain chaotic energy and social loosening of the post-war era.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Primary Tags:** Factory Girls (Jokō), Humor, Post-war Japan, Gender Dynamics, Social Customs, Travelogue.
