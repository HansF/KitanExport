## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

鴨川君は默つてしまつた。だから、女つて奴は、扱い難いという顔付である。
「貴女、自分が犯人でないなら、どうして辯護士をお頼みにならないの？」
「他人に辯解して貰う事なんかありません。自分の事は、自分が一番よく知つてるんですもの」
晴子は又暫く考えていたが、傍の司法事務官に、調書の筆記を依頼した。
以下、司法檢事補大谷喜美子さんと、被疑者境稔子の對談である。
「今迄貴女が仰つた事は、全部間違いありませんね」
「えゝ、嘘は申していません」
「堀に於ける貴女の行動と時間も、御記憶に相違ありませんね」
「はい」
「貴女と郁夫さんとの交際関係は、どの程度でしたか？」
「身體を許したのは三度きりです。それは、私が進んで許したので、あの人は暴力に訴えたりなんか、全然しませんでした。」
「郁夫さんを憎んでいましたか？」
「……いいえ、最初、男の好奇心から處女を奪われたと聞いた時には、腹も立ちましたけれど、最初に處女を許した時の人は、心から憎み切れません。あの人が私の肉体に必要を感じられた時、私は再びあの人にお任せしましたならと思つて――」
そう言つて、少し頰を染めると、視線を斜に逃げた。やや小柄なせいか、うなだれた彼女は一層しおらしく見え白い襟許に戰ぐパーマの髮が、手を觸れれば露の落ちる、秋海棠のようになよなよしい。
動機が崩れた！ もうアリバイさえ確立すれば、彼女はこんな忌々しい緣衣と手錠から、今すぐにでも解放されるのに。しかし、この絶対磁桶のアリバイは、果たして崩れるだろうか。それはとても常識の世界ではないのだ。
「あたし、貴女の為に 出来るだけお力になつてあげるわ。あたし、貴女と話してると、段々自信がつて来るの 貴女はそんな恐ろしい人ぢやないわね 貴女は人を殺したりするような、そんな悪い人ぢやないわね。ね、ね、そうでしよう？」
「私…私、あの人の事、本当に何も知らないんです……」
彼女はそう言うと、突然その頰からは、涙が堰を切つて溢れ、激しい嗚咽に、泣き崩れてしまうのだつた。
……D……
それから五日がかかりで、部長が調べあげて来た事項――
一、兇器の外科鋸からは、指紋發見されず。
二、死亡時間、午後六時に間違いなし
三、犯行當日の關係者の動き。
イ、亘椋郁夫、境稔子は供述書の通り。
ロ、亘椋郁夫、午後六時頃は入院患者見廻りの為、確かに在院。
丁度その前後に、看護婦菅原三四子より電話があり、院長が取次いだので、時間的にも誤謬なし。
ハ、看護婦濱寺波子、五時半より八時頃まで、交通事故患者報告の為、市警本部と京都驛へ出張。
ニ、看護婦菅原三四子、境看護婦と前後して、午後三時半頃自動車で外出、ワクチンその他を取寄せる為に、近くの病院や保健所を巡回、午後六時頃、九條保健所より、所定量が得られなかつた旨本院へ電話。それから山科保健所等を廻つた為に、十時頃に歸院。
ホ、運轉手宿院茂夫、病気欠勤。
その他に、これらに対して、部長はこう報告した。
「運轉手はたしかに一日中家に寝ていました。急性大腸カタルで、半時間おきぐらいに便所へ走つてましたから、全然外出など思いもよりません。」
尚それからですね、晴子さんを前にして、一寸言い難い話なんですがね、あの兇行のあつた前夜、郁夫君は境看護婦を自室へ引入れたんですね。今迄肉体関係のあつた、菅原、濱寺兩看護婦が、とても嫉妬して、境看護婦を、二人して物凄くいじめたと、他の看護婦が証言したんですがね」
「ふん、その二人の看護婦にも、郁夫殺害の動機は、可能性があるという譯だね。女の嫉妬には、万軍の將も降参したというからね」
「所が菅原君の方は、犯行のあつた午...

鴨川君は黙ってしまった。だから、女って奴は、扱い難いという顔付きである。
「貴女（あなた）、自分が犯人でないなら、どうして弁護士をお頼みにならないの？」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Kamogawa-kun became silent. Therefore, [on his face] is a look saying "women, those creatures, are difficult to handle."
"You, if you are not the criminal, why do you not request a lawyer?"
"I have no need to have someone else make excuses for me. About my own matters, I myself know them best."
Haruko was thinking for a while again, but to the judicial administrative official nearby, she requested the writing of a deposition.
Below is the dialogue between Assistant Judicial Prosecutor Otani Kimiko-san and suspect Sakai Toshiko.
"What you have said until now, there are no mistakes in all of it, right?"
"Yes, I have told no lies."
"Regarding your actions and time at the moat, there is no difference in your memory, right?"
"Yes."
"Regarding your relationship with Ikuo-san, to what extent was it?"
"Allowing my body [to be taken] was only three times. That was because I went forward and allowed it, so that person did not resort to violence or anything at all."
"Did you hate Ikuo-san?"
"...No, at first, when I heard that he took my virginity out of male curiosity, I was angry, but the person to whom I first gave my virginity, I cannot hate completely. When that person felt a need for my body, I thought if I entrusted myself to that person again—"
Saying so, when she stained her cheeks a little, her gaze escaped diagonally. Perhaps because she was small-statured, she who hung her head looked even more pitiable, and the permed hair fluttering at her white collar was as supple as a begonia, from which dew falls if a hand touches it.
The motive collapsed! If only an alibi is established, she from such hateful prisoner clothes and handcuffs, even right now would be released. However, this absolute magnetic-cask (?) alibi, will it truly collapse? That is not at all the world of common sense.
"I, for your sake, will become your strength as much as possible. I, when talking to you, gradually confidence comes. You are not such a scary person, are you? You are not such a bad person as to do things like killing people. Right, right, isn't that so?"
"I... I, about that person's matters, really I know nothing..."
When she said so, suddenly from those cheeks, tears broke the dam and overflowed, and in violent sobbing, she ended up breaking down crying.
……D……
From then taking five days, the items that the Department Chief investigated and brought—
1. From the murder weapon surgical saw, fingerprints not discovered.
2. Death time, 6:00 PM without mistake.
3. Movement of involved parties on the day of the crime.
A. Wataru Ikuo and Sakai Toshiko are as per the written statements.
B. Wataru Ikuo, around 6:00 PM for the purpose of rounding on inpatients, was certainly in the hospital.
Just around that time, there was a phone call from Nurse Sugawara Miyoko, and the Director handled it, so chronologically no error.
C. Nurse Hamadera Namiko, from 5:30 until around 8:00, for the purpose of reporting on traffic accident patients, went on a business trip to City Police HQ and Kyoto Station.
D. Nurse Sugawara Miyoko, alternating with Nurse Sakai, at around 3:30 PM went out by car, to fetch vaccines and others, circuited nearby hospitals and health centers; at around 6:00 PM, from Kujo Health Center, phoned the main hospital to the effect that the designated amount could not be obtained. After that, because she went around Yamashina Health Center etc., she returned to the hospital around 10:00.
E. Driver Shukuin Takeo, absent due to illness.
Besides these, toward these, the Chief reported like this.
"The driver was certainly sleeping at home all day. Due to acute intestinal catarrh, because he was running to the toilet every half hour or so, going out at all is unthinkable."
"Furthermore from then, Haruko-san, it's a bit of a hard-to-say story in front of you, but the night before that murder took place, Ikuo-kun pulled Nurse Sakai into his room. Until now, Nurses Sugawara and Hamadera, who had physical relationships, were very jealous and, the two together bullied Nurse Sakai terribly, so other nurses testified."
"Hmm, for those two nurses as well, regarding the motive for killing Ikuo, there is a possibility. For a woman's jealousy, it is said even a general of ten thousand armies surrenders."
"However, regarding Sugawara-kun, on the afternoon when the crime occurred..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Kamogawa fell silent. His expression betrayed a typical masculine disdain: "Women... they really are nothing but trouble."
"Miss, if you’re truly innocent, why won't you hire a lawyer?" 
"I don't need anyone making excuses for me. I know the truth of my own life better than anyone."
Haruko pondered this for a moment before asking the nearby clerk to begin recording the deposition. What follows is the transcript of the interrogation between Assistant Prosecutor Kimiko Otani and the suspect, Toshiko Sakai.
"Everything you've told us so far—is it all true?"
"Yes. I haven't told a single lie."
"And your account of your movements near the moat? You're certain of the timing?"
"I am."
"How would you describe the nature of your relationship with Ikuo?"
"I gave myself to him only three times. It was entirely of my own volition; he never used force or anything of the sort."
"Did you hate him?"
"...No. At first, when I realized he had taken my virginity out of mere curiosity, I was furious. But you can never truly bring yourself to hate the first person you've been with. When he told me he needed me again, I thought... I thought I might just give myself to him once more—"
As she spoke, a faint blush crept into her cheeks and she averted her eyes. She was a petite woman; as she sat there with her head bowed, she looked utterly pitiable. Her permed hair fluttered against her white collar, appearing as delicate and fragile as a begonia flower that might shed its dew at the slightest touch.
The motive had vanished! If only her alibi could be proven, she could be stripped of those wretched prison clothes and handcuffs immediately. But could this seemingly airtight alibi truly be broken? It defied all common sense.
"I want to help you as much as I can," Haruko said. "Talking to you like this, I’m becoming more and more convinced. You aren't a monster. You aren't the kind of person who could ever kill someone. You aren't that bad, are you? Tell me I'm right."
"I... I really don't know anything about it..." Toshiko stammered. Then, the dam broke. Tears flooded down her cheeks, and she collapsed into a fit of violent, racking sobs.

...D...

Five days later, the Chief presented the findings of his investigation:
1. No fingerprints were found on the murder weapon, a surgical saw.
2. The time of death was confirmed as 6:00 PM.
3. Movements of the persons of interest:
A. The statements of Ikuo Wataru and Toshiko Sakai remain as previously recorded.
B. Ikuo Wataru was confirmed to be at the hospital at 6:00 PM, making his rounds. A phone call from Nurse Miyoko Sugawara, handled by the Director at that exact time, confirms this.
C. Nurse Namiko Hamadera was away at City Police HQ and Kyoto Station from 5:30 to 8:00 PM, reporting on traffic accident victims.
D. Nurse Miyoko Sugawara left by car at 3:30 PM to collect vaccines. She visited several hospitals and clinics, calling the main office from the Kujo Health Center at 6:00 PM to report a shortage. She didn't return until 10:00 PM after visiting several other locations.
E. The driver, Takeo Shukuin, was out sick.
The Chief added, "The driver was definitely home all day. He had a nasty case of intestinal catarrh—he was running to the bathroom every thirty minutes. He couldn't have gone anywhere."
"There's one more thing, Haruko," he continued, hesitating. "It’s a bit delicate, but the night before the murder, Ikuo took Nurse Sakai into his room. The other two nurses he’d been involved with, Sugawara and Hamadera, were apparently consumed with jealousy. Other staff members testified that the two of them bullied Nurse Sakai mercilessly."
"I see," Haruko mused. "So those two have a motive as well. They say even the greatest general is no match for a woman’s scorn."
"Except, in Sugawara's case, on the afternoon of the murder..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography:** The text is presented in traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tategaki*). It uses a standard serif typeface typical of mid-century printing. The page is densely packed with text, divided into columns.
*   **Visual Elements:** An illustration occupies the center-left. It depicts a hand reaching out or perhaps a sleeve, rendered in a charcoal/ink-wash style. It is signed "玲子" (Reiko) in cursive. This adds an emotional, artistic flair to the otherwise sterile procedural text.
*   **Structure:** The narrative transitions from a dramatic interrogation scene (with dialogue indicated by brackets 「 」) to a dry, list-based investigative report (marked by Roman numerals and Katakana bullets). This shift in style—from melodrama to clinical "whodunit" logic—is a hallmark of detective fiction.
*   **Formatting:** Use of "……D……" acts as a scene break or a chapter sub-marker. The use of (102) at the bottom indicates the page number.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-war 1940s-1950s):** The language and themes suggest the "Golden Age" of Japanese detective fiction (本格, *honkaku*). The mention of "vaccines" and "health centers" (*hokenjo*) reflects the public health concerns of the post-war era.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The text contains significant period-specific gender tropes. The male character's thought that "women are difficult to handle" and the focus on the suspect's "virginity" (*shojo*) and "frailty" reflect the patriarchal social conventions of the time. The suspect's value is tied to her sexual history and her "shio-rashii" (pitiable/graceful) demeanor.
*   **Legal Terminology:** Terms like 司法検事補 (Assistant Prosecutor) and 調書 (Deposition) indicate a formal legal setting, though the interrogation style is highly dramatized.
*   **The "Nurse" Trope:** The setting of a hospital and a "love pentagon" between a doctor (Ikuo) and multiple nurses (Toshiko, Miyoko, Namiko) was a popular setup for mystery and romance novels of the era.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **秋海棠 (Shūkaidō):** The Hardy Begonia. In Japanese flower language, it often symbolizes "unrequited love" or "pity," matching the description of the suspect.
*   **縁衣 (En-i):** An older term for prisoner's clothing.
*   **大腸カタル (Daichō kataru):** Intestinal catarrh. A somewhat archaic medical term for what we would now call enteritis or severe diarrhea.
*   **万軍の将も降参 (Bangun no shō mo kōsan):** A phrase suggesting that even a great military commander is helpless against certain things—in this case, "womanly jealousy."
*   **絶対磁桶 (Zettai jitsu-oke?):** This is a difficult term. Based on context, it likely refers to a "water-tight" or "air-tight" (absolute) alibi. It might be a misprint or a very specific period idiom/scientific metaphor (like a magnetic seal).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Fallen Woman" vs. The "Pure Woman":** The interrogation focuses heavily on Toshiko's sexual history. Her willingness to "give her body" is used as a tool to evaluate her character—either as a motive for murder or a sign of her submissive, non-violent nature.
*   **Rationality vs. Emotion:** The text pits Haruko's emotional intuition (believing Toshiko is too "gentle" to kill) against the cold facts of the investigation (the surgical saw, the timelines).
*   **Jealousy as a Motive:** The subtext suggests that in this world, female jealousy is a force of nature so powerful it can drive multiple people to murder, serving as a classic red herring or motive in the "whodunit" structure.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Detective Story, Mystery.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Interrogation, Alibi, Hospital Drama, Crime, Post-war Japan, Gender Roles, Jealousy.
*   **Classification:** Mature (mentions of sexual relationships and murder).
