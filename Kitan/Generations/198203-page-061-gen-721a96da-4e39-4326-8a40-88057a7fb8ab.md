愛技ももちいないのに、早くも亢ぶっている
のだ。
　どうもヘンだ……僕はこの頃、急にある種
の媚態がこまやかになってきた彼女の体内の
衝動的変化を見のがすことができない。だが
それを口にすることは恐ろしかった。
　やがて、みつ子はすやすやと微かな寝息を
たてて眠りはじめた。が、僕は眠るどころで
はない。
　すると、いままでぜんぜん気にもしないで
いた隣室の、ヒソヒソとささやく気配が、や
たらに耳へ入ってきたのである。
「いやよッてば……また、浮気がはじまった
んですもの……」
　おゆきさんのなまめかしい低声だ。鮪入道
親方が要求しているらしい。
「くすぐったいじゃないの。親方、しつこい
わ……こんなこと今日、おとなりの奥さんに
したんでしょ」
「うそこけ……映画を見てただけさ」
　源親方のだみ声が妙に鼻にかかって、それ
に答える。
「よくあんたなんかにさわらせたのね……お
人形みたいな顔して……案外なのね」
「よせったら。きこえるじゃねえか」

「あっ、いたいわ。ねェ、もう今夜はおそい
から……ねむいのよ……いやったら、今夜は
……ペッペッ、くさい！　お酒のんだのね…」
「じゃ、いってやろうか……こう……こうや
ったんだよ」
　僕はほとんど無意識に床の上に坐り、襖の
すき間からのぞいていた。
「よして……そんな乱暴なこと！」
　源親方はガバっと起き上がり、毛むくじゃ
らの厚い胸に、ゴム人形のようにたわたわし
たおゆきさんを抱き上げている。
　おゆきさんはもがきながらもこちらの二人
に気がねするのか、間の襖のほうへ顔を向け
じいっと見つめていた。その細めた眼はふる
いつきたいほど妖艶だった。
「こうしてやったんだぞ、ホラ、どうだい…」
　親方は片手でやすやすとおゆきさんを膝の
上へ抱き上げ、片手をめちゃくちゃに動かし
ている。どうやらくすぐったり、揉みしだい
たり、つねったりしているらしい。

## 3️⃣ Literal English Translation

```markdown
Even without using love-techniques, [she] is already aroused.
It is somewhat strange... Lately, I cannot overlook the impulsive changes inside her body, as a certain kind of coquetry has suddenly become detailed [intense]. But I was terrified to speak of it.
Eventually, Mitsuko began to sleep, breathing faintly and peacefully. But, I am far from being able to sleep.
Just then, the presence of whispering voices from the adjacent room—which I had not paid any attention to until now—excessively entered my ears.
"I said no... [You/It] has started cheating again..."
It is Oyuki-san's voluptuous low voice. It seems the Maguro-nyudo [Tuna-monk] Boss is making demands.
"It tickles. Boss, you're persistent... You did this sort of thing to the wife next door today, didn't you?"
"Liar... We just watched a movie."
Gen-oyakata [Boss Gen]'s raspy voice, strangely nasal, answers that.
"To think she let someone like you touch her... With a face like a doll... She's unexpected, isn't she?"
"Cut it out. They can hear us."

"Ah, that hurts. Hey, it's already late tonight... I'm sleepy... I said no, not tonight... Ptu, ptu, you stink! You drank sake, didn't you..."
"Then, shall I tell you... Like this... I did it like this."
I sat on the floor almost unconsciously and was peeping through the crack in the fusuma [sliding door].
"Stop it... Such rough things!"
Gen-oyakata suddenly rose up, and against his thick, hairy chest, he is lifting up Oyuki-san, who was bending [tawatawa] like a rubber doll.
Oyuki-san, while struggling, perhaps out of consideration for the two of us over here, turned her face toward the dividing fusuma and stared fixedly. Those narrowed eyes were bewitching enough to make one tremble.
"I did it like this, look, how is it..."
The Boss easily lifted Oyuki-san onto his lap with one hand, and is moving his other hand messily. It seems he is tickling, mauling, and pinching her.

She is already aroused, even without any skillful stimulation.
Something is strange... lately, I cannot help but notice the impulsive changes within her body, a sudden and subtle coquetry taking root. Yet, I was too terrified to mention it aloud.
Eventually, Mitsuko began to doze off, her breathing soft and peaceful. I, however, was far from sleep.
It was then that the whispering presence from the next room—which I had completely ignored until now—began to intrude aggressively upon my ears.
"I said no... you're cheating again, aren't you..."
It was Oyuki's voice, low and voluptuous. It seemed the "Tuna-Monk" Boss was making demands.
"That tickles! You're persistent, Boss... You did this kind of thing to the wife next door today too, didn't you?"
"Don't lie... We only watched a movie."
Boss Gen's gravelly voice, strangely nasal and thick, retorted.
"I can't believe she let someone like you touch her... with that doll-like face of hers... she's full of surprises."
"Knock it off. They can hear us."

"Ah, that hurts! Look, it's late... I'm sleepy... I said no, not tonight... Ptu! You stink! You've been drinking sake..."
"Then, shall I show you? Like this... this is how I did it."
Almost unconsciously, I sat up on the floor and peered through the crack in the sliding door.
"Stop... that's too rough!"
Boss Gen sprang up, lifting Oyuki against his thick, hairy chest; she was pliable in his arms, bending like a rubber doll.
Even as she struggled, perhaps worried about disturbing us next door, Oyuki turned her face toward the partition and stared fixedly at it. Her narrowed eyes were so bewitching they made me shiver.
"I gave it to her just like this! Look! How do you like that..."
The Boss easily hoisted Oyuki onto his knee with one arm, his other hand moving wildly. He appeared to be tickling, mauling, and pinching her all at once.

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Format:** Serialized pulp fiction (*kasto-tori* style literature).
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person ("Boku" / 僕). The narrator is characterized as passive, intellectual, and voyeuristic, contrasting with the active, physical nature of the characters he observes.
*   **Layout:** The text is typeset to wrap around a central illustration (not described here but integral to the layout). The dialogue is heavy, driving the scene dynamically.
*   **Character Archetypes:**
    *   **The Narrator:** The "Peeping Tom" (voyeur).
    *   **Mitsuko:** The sleeping, innocent (or seemingly innocent) partner, serving as a foil to the eroticized neighbor.
    *   **Gen-oyakata (Maguro-nyudo):** The "Beauty and the Beast" aggressor. Rough, working-class, physically imposing.
    *   **Oyuki:** The "fallen" woman or bar hostess archetype—resisting but complicit, described with words like "voluptuous" (*namamekashii*) and "bewitching" (*youen*).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Fusuma (襖) & Privacy:** The scene relies on the architecture of traditional Japanese apartments or inns (*ryokan*), where rooms are separated only by paper sliding doors (*fusuma*). This lack of soundproofing is a staple trope in Japanese erotica for facilitating voyeurism and eavesdropping.
*   **"Maguro-nyudo" (鮪入道):** A grotesque nickname. *Maguro* (tuna) implies a large, perhaps oily or drunk body. *Nyudo* refers to a shaved-head monster from folklore (or a monk). This fits the *Ero-Guro* (Erotic Grotesque) aesthetic of *Kitan Club*, juxtaposing a beautiful woman against a monstrous male figure.
*   **Postwar Housing:** The setting implies the cramped living conditions of the Showa era (likely 1950s), where neighbors' lives bled into one another.
*   **Alcohol:** The reference to the "stink of sake" marks the male character as lacking the refinement expected in polite society, heightening the "rough" fantasy.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes

*   **Tawatawa (たわたわ):** A mimetic word (ideophone) describing something bending, pliable, or yielding. Here used to describe the woman's body as a "rubber doll," emphasizing objectification and flexibility.
*   **Namamekashii (なまめかしい):** Translated as voluptuous, erotic, or coquettish. It implies a humid, heavy kind of attractiveness.
*   **Damigoe (だみ声):** A thick, raspy, or gravelly voice, often associated with villains or rough laborers.
*   **Aigi (愛技):** Literally "love techniques." A euphemism for sexual maneuvering or foreplay.
*   **Kigane (気がね):** Feeling constrained or hesitant out of consideration for others (social anxiety/politeness). Even in a rough sexual scene, the character worries about the neighbors, a distinctly Japanese social marker.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism & Participation:** The narrator claims to be passive, yet he "unconsciously" moves to the crack in the door. He is titillated not just by the act next door, but by the suspicion that his own partner (*Mitsuko*) and the neighbor (*Oyuki*) share a secret erotic nature.
*   **Parallelism:** The dialogue implies the Boss was with the narrator's partner ("the wife next door") earlier ("You did this to her, didn't you?"). The narrator is witnessing a reenactment of what might have happened to his own sleeping partner.
*   **The Grotesque Body:** The contrast between the "hairy thick chest" of the man and the "rubber doll" pliability of the woman is classic *Kitan Club* imagery—emphasizing texture and physical disparity.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Genre:** Showa Pulp / Ero-Guro / Voyeur Fiction.
*   **Sexual Content:** High (Implied sexual assault/rough play, voyeurism).
*   **Themes:** Infidelity, Eavesdropping, Roughness, Alcohol use.
*   **Keywords:** *Fusuma*, Peeping, Rubber Doll, Boss (Oyakata), Struggle.
