「おッ！ 奥様が、あまりに綺麗でだ、忘れていただ。この芋ア少し早えで、うまく無えかも知れねえが、まア食うが好えだよ。」
　熊翁は、再び芋をブラ下げると、裏へ廻つた。
『小父さん。毎度すまないのね。そこへあけておいて頂戴ほんとに有難う……』
　ヒサ子にしてみれば、熊翁は有難かつた。一坪の野菜畑も持たない夫婦は、附近の百姓達より日々の副食物を求めねばならなかつた。下のあの安さん方にも相当世話になつたが、此の熊翁ぐらい、何から何迄気のつく世話をしてくれる人間はなかつた。米麦などでも、自家のを盗んできてまでも、こちらの不自由を補つてくれているようだった。夫の信夫氏は一切そんな事は知らず、何となく変な爺さんだなアぐらいしか思つていない。
　人間が好色無類である事はヒサ子も知つていた。或る夏の夕暮、ヒサ子が裏庭で行水してゐると、熊翁がヒョッコリ這入つてきた。ヒサ子とて娘ぢやあるまいし、三十六にもなつた小母さんが、慌てゝ飛び出る事もあるまいと、悠然とタライの中に納まつていると、何の躊躇もなく、ヅカ／＼とヒサ子の傍へ近寄つた。
「流しやしよう……」
　と、彼女が股間を掩つていたタオルを、素早く取りあげて、”熊の掌”で彼女の厚い左肩をガシとつかんだ。彼の流しは必要以上の時間をあつして、時折、腰のあたりをそつと撫でたり、まちがつたような素振りをして、乳房の方へ掌を廻したりした。しかし流石それ以上の事はしなかつた。
　ヒサ子は、之でスッカリこりてしまつて、夫が帰宅してからでないと、絶対に行水しない事にきめた。

　信夫が元気な顔をみせて帰つた。
『あなた。おサツが蒸してあるのよ。』
『もう一芋が喰えるのかい？そいつアステキだ。どれかしないか。』
『なか／＼やわくてあまいわお安ツさんでも、呉れたのかい？』
『いいえ。熊さんなの。』
『何だ。熊さんか……。変な爺さんだなア。あれで、なか／＼色気があるツて評判だから、こいつアお前、用心しなけりゃいけないよ。』
『ホッホッ。あんな事言ってまさか……。』
『いや、そのまさかが危いんだ。どうもあの爺さんは虫が好かないね。』
『でもいつもよくして呉れるんですもの。どれだけ助かつているか知れやしないわ。』
『まア出来るだけ世話にならないように注意するさ。その内の街道筋へ出るようにするよ。こんな山裾の生活は気に食わない。』
『早くお願いするわ。あたしだつて飽きあきしちやつた。』
『おい。早く飯を済ませて、お詣りしようぢやないか。今夜もいい星空だろう。』
『え。でも、先刻熊さんが夫婦でお詣りしや効果が無いと言つていたのよ。そう言えばお安ツさんも、天神さんは男の神様だから、旦那様と御いつしよぢや、神様がヤキモチして子種を授けて呉れないんですツて。』
『何言つてるのさ。俺は護衛について行くだけぢやアないか。お前を一人でやらして、飛んだ生神様の子種を頂戴するのは御免だよ。』
『まああなた。相手は神様ぢやないの？』
『ふん、女学校をともかく出たお前が、いまだにそんな頭か？ これだから日本は戦争に負けるんだ。ともかく俺はいっしよに行くよ。』
『片意地な人！ 利き目が無ければお詣りは無意味ぢやないの？』
『昨夜は無意味だつたかい？あれこそお詣りの効果なんだぜ……』
　信夫氏は、少しはしたなく思つたが思い切つて言つた。
　ヒサ子夫人は、流石、まア……と言つて軽く差しうつむいたが、直ぐ立つて仕度するのだった。
『おい。ぢやア俺が行つてもいいんだな。』
『えゝ。』
　ヒサ子夫人の声は、低かつた。

六
　満願の二十一目目が来た。その晝、ヒサ子は所用があつて、下のお安ツさん宅へ行つた。お安ツさんは、ヒサ子が夫婦で祈願に詣つているのを知つていて、せめて満願の今夜だけでもお一人でおいでなさい、折角の祈願が今日も旦那さまと御一緒ぢや、天神様の御気嫌を損じて御利益がありませんよと、真顔で云つた。
　此の夜、どうしたのか、信夫氏の帰宅が遅かつた。ヒサ子は先に食事をして、夫を心待ちしていたが、なか／＼帰つてこない。こんな事も二三度あつたが、ヒサ子は一人で行くのを堅く禁じられていたので、素直にいつも迄も待つていたものだが、今夜の夫の帰りは馬鹿に遅く、晝間、お安さんに云われた言葉が、頭ん中にひろがつて来て、あたし一人で行こうかしら……
　とうとう立ち上つた。黙つて行つてもわるいと思つたので、ビンセンを一枚ちぎつて鉛筆を走らせた。

　すい分お待ちしておりましたが、にお帰りが無いので、あたし一人でお詣りしてきます。今夜は満願の日ですし、お安ツさんも必ず一人でおいでなさいと云つてますし、馴れた道です故大丈夫です。心配しないで下さい。早く帰つてきます。水屋の中にあなたのお好きな物が入れてあります。あたしも一つだけ頂きましたものよ。
　旦那様
　　　　　　　　ヒサ子

　垣根を出ると、すんぐりとした人が立つていた。ヒサ子はビツクリしたが、先方は気サクにペコリと腰をまげて、「お晩です。」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The fact that [is] secured [is], the villagers etc. [calling him] "Wandering Bear, Wandering Bear" behind [his] back, [is] also understandable.
"Oh! The Madame [is] so beautiful, [I] forgot. These potatoes [are] a bit early, [so they] might not be good, but well, eating [them is] good."
The Old Man Bear, again hanging potatoes, turned to the back.
"Uncle. Every time [I am] sorry (thank you). Please leave [them] there. Truly thank you..."
For Hisako, Old Man Bear was grateful (appreciated). The couple who did not have even one *tsubo* of vegetable garden, had to seek daily side-dishes from nearby farmers. They were considerably indebted to the An-san below, but like this Old Man Bear, there was no human who took care [of them] from what to what (everything). Even for rice and wheat, even stealing his own [family's], it seemed he was supplementing their inconvenience. Her husband Nobuo-shi did not know such things at all, thinking no more than "somehow [he is] a strange old man."
That the human [is] matchlessly lecherous, Hisako also knew. A certain summer evening, while Hisako was bathing in the backyard, Old Man Bear suddenly entered. Thinking that Hisako is not a young girl, and a 36-year-old auntie should not hurriedly jump out, she stayed calmly in the tub, when without any hesitation, [he] walked thud-thud close to Hisako's side.
"Let [me] wash [you]..."
And, the towel she was covering [her] crotch [with], [he] quickly took up, and with "Bear's Paw" [he] grabbed her thick left shoulder firmly. His washing spent more time than necessary, occasionally stroking around the waist, or making a mistaken-like gesture, turning [his] palm toward [her] breasts. But as expected, [he] did not do more than that.
Hisako, by this, completely was fed up, and decided never to bathe unless after her husband returned home.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

It was easy to see why the villagers mockingly referred to him behind his back as "The Wandering Bear."
"Oh! Madam, you’re so beautiful I nearly forgot myself," the old man stammered. "These potatoes are a bit early in the season, so they might not taste like much, but here—you’d best have some anyway."
Swinging the bundle of potatoes, Old Man Bear disappeared around the back of the house.
"Thank you, Uncle. You’re always so kind. Just leave them there, really... thank you so much."
To Hisako, the old man was a godsend. She and her husband didn't own so much as a square yard of garden, so they had to rely on local farmers for their daily groceries. While they owed much to the woman they called "O-yasun," no one was as attentive as Old Man Bear. It seemed he would go so far as to steal rice and grain from his own household just to ensure they didn't go without. Her husband, Nobuo, was oblivious to the extent of this help, dismissing him as nothing more than a "strange old fellow."
Hisako was well aware, however, that the man was a lecher beyond compare. One summer evening, while she was bathing in a tub in the backyard, the old man had suddenly appeared. Thinking that, at thirty-six, she was hardly a blushing maiden who needed to bolt at the sight of a man, she remained composed in the water. But without a moment’s hesitation, he marched right up to her.
"Let me scrub your back," he muttered.
Before she could protest, he snatched away the towel she had been using to cover herself. He clamped a "bear-like" paw onto her shoulder. The washing took far longer than necessary; his hands strayed toward her waist and, under the guise of an accidental slip, he would brush his palms against her breasts. He hadn't gone any further than that, but it was enough.
Thoroughly shaken by the encounter, Hisako made a firm rule: she would never bathe again until her husband was safely home.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a standard vertical orientation (*tategaki*), typical of Japanese periodicals. It is divided into two or three columns per page, though this specific scan shows a multi-column structure with horizontal dividers separating sections of the narrative (marked with Roman numerals IV, V, and VI).
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style, common for mid-century printing. The print quality shows some "bleeding" or "ink spread," typical of the cheap paper used in *Kasutori* (pulp) magazines of the era.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses traditional Japanese punctuation, including the repetition mark "々" and the iteration mark "／＼" for sounds (like ヅカ／＼ - *zuka-zuka*).
*   **Structure:** The story is serialized, as indicated by the section numbers. The bottom of the page features a page number in parentheses: `( 78 )`.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Dialogue is enclosed in brackets (「」 or 『』), with the latter often used for internal thoughts or nested dialogue/letters.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s - Early 1950s):** The text mentions "Japan losing the war" (日本は戦争に負けるんだ), placing it firmly in the post-WWII reconstruction period. Food scarcity is a major subtext; the couple relies on neighbors for potatoes and rice because they have no land.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This style of fiction—mixing mundane domestic life with suggestive or erotic undertones (the bathing scene)—is characteristic of "Kasutori" magazines. These were cheap, ephemeral publications that flourished during the occupation.
*   **Fertility and Superstition:** A central plot point is the couple's struggle to conceive. They are visiting a "Tenjin" shrine (dedicated to Sugawara no Michizane, but often associated with various blessings) to pray for "seeds" (*kodane*). There is a folk belief mentioned that a husband and wife shouldn't pray together because the male deity might get jealous and refuse the blessing.
*   **Social Status:** Hisako is a "Joshigakko" (Girls' High School) graduate, which in that era implied she was relatively well-educated/middle-class, contrasting with the "backwoods" (山裾) life they are currently forced to live.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **徘徊熊 (Haikai-guma):** "Wandering Bear." A derogatory but descriptive nickname for the old man.
*   **行水 (Gyōzui):** Bathing in a tub, often outdoors or in a washroom, common before modern indoor plumbing was ubiquitous.
*   **おサツ (O-satsu):** A colloquial/polite term for *satsumaimo* (sweet potatoes).
*   **子種 (Kodane):** Literally "child seed." A term for semen or the "seed" of a child; in this context, it refers to the blessing of fertility.
*   **満願 (Mangan):** The completion of a period of prayer or a vow at a shrine/temple (usually 21 days, as mentioned: 満願の二十一目目).
*   **水屋 (Mizuya):** An old term for a kitchen cupboard or larder.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Lecherous" Elder:** The character of Kuma-jii represents a common trope in older Japanese literature: the helpful neighbor whose kindness comes with the "price" of unwanted sexual attention. The text balances his genuine helpfulness (stealing food for them) with his predatory behavior.
*   **Modernity vs. Superstition:** The husband, Nobuo, mocks Hisako’s belief in the shrine's rules, blaming such "backwards thinking" for Japan's defeat in the war. However, Hisako is caught between her husband’s cynicism and the social pressure from other neighbors (like O-yasun) to follow tradition.
*   **Domestic Disconnect:** There is a clear disconnect between the husband and wife. Nobuo is unaware of the old man’s advances and the depth of their food insecurity, while Hisako hides her discomfort to maintain the household's supply of food.
*   **Post-War Displacement:** The couple lives on the "fringe of the mountains," a lifestyle the husband finds distasteful, suggesting they may be "repatriates" or people displaced from the city by the war/bombings.
