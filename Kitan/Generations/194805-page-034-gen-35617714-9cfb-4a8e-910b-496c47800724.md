て来た。
「どうもお待遠様、概略を説明しましょう。被害者の✕毛附近から得た汚液はA型血液のもので、少しのゴノコッゲン菌を検出出来来ます。すぐ二人の身体検査もやりまいたが、佐崎健一は淋毒性尿道炎に罹っており、この汚液の人物と完全に一致します」
　警察署の報告によつて、主任刑事はすぐ部下の者を集めると、
「佐崎を重罪犯人として留置所に入れ、西山の方を釈放し給え」
　そう言つた時だ、突然側から晴子が
「とんでもない間違いよ。刑事さん、藤村詩子を島田富子殺害犯人として逮捕して下さい！」
　と叫んでいつた。
　やがて「ひなどり」の女王詩子に手錠が下されると。彼女は静かにお手数かけましたと言つて、警察へ引かれて行つた。
「女は女同志。取調べは私に委せて下さいな」
　晴子はそう言うとすぐ彼女を深夜の刑事室へ呼んで、二人切りになるとすぐ口を開いた。
「貴女の命を懸けた恋人を奪つた女は憎いでしようが、殺さなくても話は分つたでしようねえ」
　晴子にそう言われると、始めて詩子はポチリと涙を光らせ、事件の真相をこう語り出した。
「佐崎さんは性病があるらしく、私が可愛想だからといつてコンドームを使おうといつて背かなかつたので、あの人が帰られる時に、私はその汚物の入つたのを棄てに便所へ行つたのですが、化粧室に入つている間に西山さんが帰られて、やがて私と富子さんの二人切りになつた事を知ると、急に殺意がムラムラ沸いて来たのです。それまでは殺そうなどとは思つてもみませんでした。もしあの時電燈が點いていたら、恐らくあんな事は出来なかつたと思います」
　私はあの人の室へ引返してゆくと、暗くて着物が分らないと富子さんは言つていました。私は室へ入ると細紐を取上げて、一思いに殺してしまつたのです。富子さんは案外簡単に動かなくなりました。暗いから夢中で絞めあげたのですが、人間がこんなに容易に死ぬとは思いいませんでした。それから私は富子さんの股を抑揚げて、汚物を流し込んだのです。私のやつた事はそれだけです。それからすぐお店へ帰つて何喰わぬ顔をしていたのです。私は恐ろしい夢です。でも、でも、本当は長い間夢にまで見続けて来たあの人を、誰にも取られたくなかつたのです……」
「貴女の気持、私にも分るわ。検事局への調書には出来るだけ情状を酌んで頂けるように詳しく添書してあげるわね。西山さんは吃度貴女の純情に目覺めて、心秘かに待つてられる事でしょう。貴女が自分の責任としての刑期を無事に終えて出所された時こそ、お二人で天下晴れて仲良くお暮しなさいね」
　晴子がそう言つて彼女の肩へ優しく手をかけた時、詩子はワーツとその場に泣崩れると、激しい悔悟の嗚咽に身を震わせていた。（終）

...came.
"Very sorry for the wait, let us explain the outline. The foul liquid obtained from near the victim's pubic hair is of Type A blood, and a small amount of Gonococcus bacteria can be detected. Immediately we also did physical exams of the two, and Sazaki Ken'ichi suffers from gonorrheal urethritis, perfectly matching the person of this foul liquid."
According to the police station's report, the chief detective immediately gathered his subordinates and said,
"Put Sazaki in the detention cell as a felony criminal, and please release Nishiyama."
It was when he said that, suddenly from the side Haruko,
"It is a terrible mistake. Detective, please arrest Fujimura Utako as the murderer of Shimada Tomiko!"
...shouted.
Before long, when handcuffs were placed on Utako, the queen of "Hinadori." She quietly said, "I have caused you trouble," and was led away to the police.
"Women are for women. Please leave the interrogation to me."
Haruko said so and immediately called her to the detective's room in the middle of the night, and once they became two people alone, immediately opened her mouth.
"The woman who stole your lover for whom you staked your life must be hateful, but even without killing her, the situation would have been understood, wouldn't it?"
When told so by Haruko, for the first time Utako let a single tear shine and began to tell the truth of the incident like this.
"Sazaki-san seemed to have a venereal disease, and because I felt sorry for him, I told him to use a condom and he didn't refuse, so when that person was leaving, I went to the toilet to throw away the one containing the filth, but while I was in the restroom, Nishiyama-san left, and before long knowing that Tomiko-san and I had become two alone, suddenly a murderous intent boiled up muramura. Until then, I never even thought of killing her. If at that time the electric light had been on, I think probably such a thing could not have been done."
"I returned to that person's room, and Tomiko-san was saying she couldn't tell the clothes apart because it was dark. I entered the room, picked up a thin cord, and killed her in one thought. Tomiko-san unexpectedly easily stopped moving. Because it was dark I strangled her frantically, but I didn't think a human would die so easily. Then I pushed up Tomiko-san's crotch and poured the filth in. What I did was only that. Then I immediately went back to the shop and made a face as if nothing happened. I am a terrifying dream. But, but, truly for a long time I didn't want the person I kept seeing even in my dreams to be taken by anyone..."
"Your feelings, I also understand. For the deposition to the prosecutor's office, I will write detailed notes so they can consider the circumstances as much as possible. Nishiyama-san will surely awaken to your purity and be secretly waiting for you. Precisely when you have safely finished your prison term as your own responsibility and are released, let the two of you live happily under the clear sky."
When Haruko said so and placed her hand gently on her shoulder, Utako broke down crying on the spot and was shaking her body with sobs of intense remorse. (End)

**Short Story: Daydream**
**By Asano Tomimi**

"Hey?"
It was a voice like a plea, but his eyes were shining "gira~" (glaringly).
"But...!"
In the corner of Maiko's eye, the sheet of the white bed was conscious.
(I like this person. However, if I permit it tonight in a place like this—)
Naturally strength entered her arms. Her body became a form of fleeing from the man's chest.
"You don't love me, do you?"
(My, what a stupid thing to say) She closed her eyes, but she could not erase the whiteness of the bed from her vision.
"If you don't love me, then, --then you--"
"There's no such thing (as not loving you)."
"Then, isn't it fine?"
(In a woman's first time, do they resist this much? In that case, I must be gentle—)
"Hey, it's okay, right?"
"But, I'm troubled."
(If this were only a kiss—)
In her arms, instinctive strength gathered.
(Even though I am being this gentle, this woman...) He bitterly reflected on his own pleading appearance from a moment ago. At the same time, he felt anger, humiliation, and irritation at the strength of her arms trying to keep him away with both hands. (Strength in a woman's arms. Is that what a woman who loves me does?)
"What, what are you doing?"
Even feeling the man's rough breath, she thought it was filthy. She stiffened her body with all her strength and thought of the bed.
"I'll scream. I'll call people."
However, from her head, from her chest, from her feet, strength went away.
(Mustn't, at this rate—why don't I resist more, if I lose won't it be irreversible—) She commanded all her muscles.
(But, why, like this as if melting, do both will and strength drain away, is it because the man is strong?)
"Mother!" she shouted so and gathering all strength in her body into both legs, she splashed like a fish.
She heard the glass bottle on the table make a big sound on the floor like a dream and pressed the bell's tack strongly.
(But, messy hair, a blouse full of wrinkles. If I am seen in such a state by people, I will be seen as a defiled woman, ah.)
Trying to jump out, she suddenly woke up. Brushing back the stray hair stuck flat with sweat, and vaguely looking outside the window, flowers were trembling in the wind, it was an apartment's late afternoon.

"...and that is the situation. The fluid found near the victim’s pubic hair is Type A, and traces of gonococcus were detected. We immediately performed physical examinations on both suspects; Sazaki Ken'ichi is suffering from gonorrheal urethritis, which is a perfect match for the sample."
Following the police report, the chief detective gathered his men. "Put Sazaki in the holding cell for a felony charge," he ordered. "And release Nishiyama."
Just then, Haruko spoke up from the side. "That’s a terrible mistake, Detective! You must arrest Fujimura Utako for the murder of Shimada Tomiko!" she cried.
Soon, handcuffs were placed on Utako, the 'Queen' of the cabaret *Hinadori*. She went quietly, murmuring, "Thank you for your trouble," as she was led away to the station.
"Woman to woman—leave the interrogation to me," Haruko said. She called Utako into the midnight interview room and, once they were alone, began. "You must have hated the woman who stole the lover you’d staked your life on, but surely you could have talked it out without killing her?"
At Haruko’s words, a single tear finally glistened in Utako’s eye, and she began to confess the truth.
"Sazaki seemed to have a disease. I felt sorry for him, so I insisted he use a condom. When he left, I went to the toilet to dispose of it. But while I was in the restroom, Nishiyama came home. When I realized it was just Tomiko and me, a sudden, dark impulse to kill surged within me. I’d never even thought of it until that moment. If the lights had been on, I probably couldn't have done it. I went back to her room; she was complaining that she couldn't see her clothes in the dark. I picked up a thin cord and killed her then and there. She stopped moving surprisingly easily. It was so dark I just strangled her frantically—I never imagined it was so easy for a person to die. Then I pushed up her legs and poured the fluid into her. That was all. Then I went back to the shop and acted as if nothing had happened. It feels like a terrible dream. But truly... I just didn't want anyone to take the man I’ve dreamed of for so long."
"I understand how you feel," Haruko replied. "I’ll add a detailed note to the prosecutor’s report to ask for leniency. I’m sure Nishiyama will realize the depth of your devotion and wait for you in secret. Once you’ve served your time and are released, you two should live together happily under the open sky."
As Haruko placed a gentle hand on her shoulder, Utako collapsed, her body racking with sobs of profound remorse. (End)

**Short Story: Daydream**
**By Asano Tomimi**

"Hey...?"
His voice was a plea, yet his eyes glinted with a predatory light.
"But—!"
Maiko caught a glimpse of the white bedsheets in the corner of her eye.
*(I love him. But if I give in here, tonight—)*
Instinctively, her arms tensed, her body arching away from his chest.
"You don't love me, do you?"
*(Oh, don't be ridiculous.)* She closed her eyes, but the stark whiteness of the bed remained seared into her mind.
"If you don't love me, then... then you..."
"That’s not true."
"Then it's fine, isn't it?"
*(Is this how much a woman resists her first time?)* the man thought. *(I suppose I must be gentler.)* "Come on, it'll be alright, won't it?"
"But... it’s not right."
*(If it were only a kiss...)* Maiko thought. Her arms stiffened with an instinctive strength.
*(After I’ve been this patient, this woman...)* He reflected bitterly on his own pleading. Simultaneously, he felt a surge of anger and humiliation at the way she held him off. *(Using her strength against me... is that how a woman who loves me acts?)*
"What... what are you doing?"
The mere sensation of his ragged breath felt revolting to her now. Her entire body went rigid as she thought of the bed. "I’ll scream! I’ll call for help!"
Yet, the strength began to drain from her head, her chest, her legs.
*(No, not like this—why aren't I fighting harder? If I give up now, there's no going back!)* she commanded her muscles. *(But why am I melting? Why is my will and strength fading away? Is he just too strong?)*
"Mother!" she cried out. Mustering every ounce of strength into her legs, she thrashed like a fish out of water.
She heard a glass bottle on the table shatter against the floor as if in a dream, and she slammed her finger against the call bell.
*(But my hair is a mess, my blouse is wrinkled. If anyone sees me like this, they’ll think I’m a ruined woman. Oh, God...)*
As she tried to bolt from the room, she jolted awake. She brushed back the stray hairs matted with sweat and gazed blankly out the window. Outside, flowers swayed in the breeze—it was just a quiet afternoon in her apartment.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese magazine style of the mid-20th century. It uses a **two-column vertical layout**.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   The top section ends with a separator and a bold **(終)** (End) mark.
    *   A horizontal line separates the two different pieces of content.
    *   The new story starts with a title box: **コント (Conto)** followed by the title **白晝夢 (Hakuchūmu)** and the author's name **浅野富美 (Asano Tomimi)**.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface typical of letterpress printing from the 1950s. It contains several **Kyūjitai** (older kanji forms) such as **晝** (daytime), **體** (body), and **檢** (examine), though it is transitioning toward modern forms.
*   **Punctuation:** The use of "〜" for emphasis (ギラ〜) and "ァ" "ゥ" for elongated vowels in dialogue (だってェ、いいだろうぅ) suggests a pulp or "Kasutori" (dregs) magazine style, which often used slightly informal or sensationalist punctuation.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** The content strongly suggests the **late 1940s to mid-1950s**. This was the era of the **"Kasutori" magazines**—cheap, pulp-fiction publications that thrived during the post-war occupation. They often featured a mix of eroticism (*ero*), grotesquerie (*guro*), and sentimentality (*nansensu*).
*   **Medical & Social Context:** The first story mentions **"Gonococcus" (淋菌)** and **"Gonorrheal urethritis" (淋毒性尿道炎)**. During the early post-war period, venereal diseases were a major public health concern in Japan, often linked to the "Pan-pan" girls (prostitutes) and the chaotic social conditions. Mentioning a condom as a plot point was considered "bold" but common in pulp literature.
*   **Genre:** The term **"Conto" (コント)** is derived from the French word *conte*. In Japanese literature, it refers to a "short-short" story—a brief, punchy narrative with a twist ending.
*   **Setting:** The "Daydream" story mentions an **"Apartment" (アパート)** and a **"Call Bell" (ベルの鋲)**. In the 1950s, modern apartments were a symbol of urban Westernization and often served as settings for romantic or scandalous fiction.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **汚液 (Oeki/Obun):** Literally "foul liquid." In this context, it is a euphemism for semen used as forensic evidence.
*   **ひなどり (Hinadori):** "Chicks" or "Fledglings." Likely the name of a cabaret or bar where Utako worked as the "Queen" (top hostess).
*   **ムラムラ (Mura-mura):** An onomatopoeia for a sudden surge of emotion, usually used for sexual arousal but here used for a surge of "murderous intent" (殺意).
*   **情状を酌む (Jōjō o kumu):** To take circumstances into account; to show leniency in a legal context.
*   **後れ毛 (Okurege):** Stray hair or "wisps" of hair that escape a hairstyle, often used in literature to suggest a woman is disheveled or has been in a state of distress/passion.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Jealousy and Obsession:** The first story explores the "fatal attraction" trope, where a woman commits a gruesome murder to "keep" a man she loves.
*   **The "Defiled Woman" Complex:** The second story centers on the protagonist Maiko’s fear of being seen as "汚された女" (a defiled/soiled woman). This reflects conservative Shōwa-era gender norms regarding female chastity and social reputation.
*   **Eroticism and Violence:** Both stories blend tension with physical or sexual themes. The first story involves a forensic detail about "filth" being poured into a victim to frame someone, while the second uses a "near-assault" dream to create a sense of peril and relief.
*   **The "It was all a dream" Trope:** A classic literary device used to explore taboo subjects (pre-marital sex, sexual violence) without having to resolve the social consequences in the narrative reality.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Fiction, Short Story (Conto), Mystery/Crime.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Romance, Jealousy, Murder, Post-war Japan, Eroticism, Medical forensics, Kasutori culture, Gender roles, Dream sequence.
