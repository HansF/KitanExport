では小さなホテルを経営していました。大阪に歸つてからは、ずつと遊んでばかりいましたわ。そのうち大阪の爆撃となり、主人は燒死するしその後は、敗戦の混乱に、何も出來ませんでした。まあ、いつかゆつくりお話をしてあげましよう。いまは、わたくしには、はな々々が幾つたきりなのよ。」
「それで、おばちやんは、いまもおひとりなの。」
「そう、わたくしは、いつもひとりだつたわ。主人は、あつたけど幾人も女をつくつていたわ。みなしごのようなわたしは、ひとりで大きくなつたんだもの。でもね、わたくしの生きるモツトーは、より多くの苦しみをしたので、より多くの享楽にしがみつくのよ」より美代は、美穂子のナゾのような言葉を、はつきり理解出来なかつたけれども、何かしら自分の求めている心の憔燥を、癒してくれるようなひびきを感じたのたつた。

　　**三、のぞいた秘密**
「美代ちやんも、すつかり上達したわ。」
ルンバを踊りながら、美穂子はいつた。
「おばちやんのしこみですもの」
美代は、うれしそうに、輕快なリズムを、正確に踏んだ。
　そこは二つの二階は、二十畳くらいの小ぢんまりしたホールだつた。学生たちが、美穂子の指導を受けては一人前にステップが踏めるようになると、お互い同志が組み合つて踊つた、美穂子は、それを見るとひとりで楽しめた。美代も男と組んで、大胆に踊るようになつた。第二の美穂子、第三の美穂子が育つてゆくことに、異状な興味を感じていた美穂子だつた。
「女が弱いのは妊娠するからよ。わたしは、多くの男を知りましたが、妊娠はしなかつた。石女かも知れないけれど……女がはらんだら敗けだわ。」
美代は、はツと胸をつかれた思いがした。堤防で奪われた純潔—もしや「はらんだではないだろうかー」という恐怖はあつた。でもあれからの男を、なぜかその男が戀しかつた。白線の男を見るたびに、あとも出来ない美代だつた。
「これからは、美代ちやんたちにはいろんな危機があると思うけど、決して敗けちや駄目だわ。」
美代に、母がわりに性教育までしてくれる美穂子だつた。
「二階の便所のもう一つ奥を見學してみるとよいわ。どんな設備がしてあるか。浮気な男の無責任にまかれる種を、すつかり洗い流してしまうのよ。」
美代は教えられたまま、便所の奥をのぞいた。洗滌の設備であつた。便所から出た美代は、ふと美穂子の寝室兼居間となつている部屋のドアが開いているのを発見して、そつと内部をのぞいた。部屋はカーテンで三つに仕切られ、三つのベツドがあつた。奥のベツドの夜具の片隅が、動いている。おやと思つて眼をすえた。たしかに人の気配を感じた美代は、息を殺して、耳をそばだてた。が、一番奥のベツドの下に、女の靴と男の靴がそろえてあるのを発見して、すぐ察しがついた。女の靴は、さつきまで中学生と組んで踊つていた女學生のものに間違いなかつた。カーテンが、かすかにふるえている。はげしい人の息使いが聞えてきた。呆然と立つていた美代は、急に堤防に現れた、男の火のような唇を感じ、全身しびれるように締めつけられ、例の男の逞しい肉体を思い出し、男の吐く熱い呼吸が、よみがえつて来た。
　喫茶はな々々の正体を見た美代だつた。それは學生ばかりの、いゝ警の終末だつた。
「夜は大人の世界ですから、學生は絶対に近づけませんよ。」
といつた美穂子の言葉が、はじめ、て美代にピンときた。
なぜ、美穂子は、こんなことを許すのだろう。美穂子は、美穂子というふしぎなおばちやんが信じられなかつた。
「女は、男をもて遊ぶだけの度胸が必要なのだわ。男が遊んでいるように、女も遊ばなくては、その度胸は出来ませんよ。でも身を持ちくずしてしまうのは、男より女の方がやつぱり多いのです。女はもつと強い試練を経なければならないと思うわ。」
これは、美代たちに、いつも語りきかせる、美穂子が實踐した哲學だつた。

　　**四、母への逆襲**
美代が階下に降りたとき、カツと血液が頭腦に沸り立つほどの衝動を受けた。じつとこちらを見ている、ひとりの男の男學生の眼とカチリと合つた。男は、美代の家庭教師谷岡だつた。
「やつぱりこゝだつた。僕は、あなたの行動を探ぐつていたのです。あなたは、このごろどうにかしている。ちつとも勉強なんかしないじやありませんか。女學生の本道へかえつて下さい。」
谷岡は、いつもの冷厳たる調子でいつた。
「本道ですつて、本道とは何ですの。學校へ行き、豫習、復習をして、夜は谷岡先生のお話をきいて、日記をかかされて寝る。起きればまた同じことを繰り返す。これが本道ですの。」
「そうです。そうするのが女學生の本道です。ワクをはずれてはいけない。自由にも責任とゆうワクがあるのです。」
「先生、わかつたわ。もうたくさん、あしたからは、その本道にかえるわ。」
「それを聞けば、僕も安心しました。では一緒に帰りましよう。」
「ねェ、先生、そのかわり、あした

では小さなホテルを経営していました。大阪に帰ってからは、ずっと遊んでばかりいましたわ。そのうち大阪の空襲となり、主人は焼死するし、その後は、敗戦の混乱で、何も出来ませんでした。まあ、いつかゆっくりお話をしてあげましょう。今は、わたくしには『はなばな』が幾つたきりなのよ」
「それで、おばちゃんは、今もお一人なの？」
「そう、わたくしは、いつも一人だったわ。主人はいたけれど、何人も女を作っていたわ。孤児のような私は、一人で大きくなったんだもの。でもね、わたくしの生きるモットーは、より多くの苦しみをしたので、より多くの享楽にしがみつくのよ」
美代は、美穂子の謎のような言葉を、はっきり理解出来なかったけれども、何かしら自分の求めている心の焦燥を、癒してくれるような響きを感じたのだった。

　　**三、のぞいた秘密**
「美代ちゃんも、すっかり上達したわ」
ルンバを踊りながら、美穂子は言った。
「おばちゃんの仕込みですもの」
美代は、嬉しそうに、軽快なリズムを、正確に踏んだ。
　そこは二階の、二十畳くらいのこぢんまりしたホールだった。学生たちが、美穂子の指導を受けては一人前にステップが踏めるようになると、お互い同士が組み合って踊った。美穂子は、それを見ると一人で楽しめた。美代も男と組んで、大胆に踊るようになった。第二の美穂子、第三の美穂子が育っていくことに、異常な興味を感じていた美穂子だった。
「女が弱いのは妊娠するからよ。私は、多くの男を知りましたが、妊娠はしなかった。石女（うまずめ）かも知れないけれど……女が孕んだら負けだわ」
美代は、はっと胸を突かれた思いがした。堤防で奪われた純潔——もしや「孕んだのではないだろうか」という恐怖はあった。でもあの時の男を、なぜかその男が恋しかった。白線の男を見るたびに、生気も出ない美代だった。
「これからは、美代ちゃんたちには色んな危機があると思うけど、決して負けちゃ駄目だわ」
美代に、母代わりに性教育までしてくれる美穂子だった。
「二階の便所のもう一つ奥を見学してみるとよいわ。どんな設備がしてあるか。浮気な男の無責任にまかれる種を、すっかり洗い流してしまうのよ」
美代は教えられたまま、便所の奥をのぞいた。洗浄の設備であった。便所から出た美代は、ふと美穂子の寝室兼居間となっている部屋のドアが開いているのを発見して、そっと内部をのぞいた。部屋はカーテンで三つに仕切られ、三つのベッドがあった。奥のベッドの夜具の片隅が、動いている。おやと思って目を据えた。確かに人の気配を感じた美代は、息を殺して、耳をそばだてた。が、一番奥のベッドの下に、女の靴と男の靴が揃えてあるのを発見して、すぐ察しがついた。女の靴は、さっきまで中学生と組んで踊っていた女学生のものに間違いなかった。カーテンが、かすかに震えている。激しい人の息遣いが聞こえてきた。呆然と立っていた美代は、急に堤防に現れた、男の火のような唇を感じ、全身しびれるように締め付けられ、例の男の逞しい肉体を思い出し、男の吐く熱い呼吸が、よみがえってきた。
　喫茶「はなばな」の正体を見た美代だった。それは学生ばかりの、いかがわしい終末だった。
「夜は大人の世界ですから、学生は絶対に近づけませんよ」
と言った美穂子の言葉が、初めて美代にピンときた。
なぜ、美穂子は、こんなことを許すのだろう。美代は、美穂子という不思議なおばちゃんが信じられなかった。
「女は、男を弄ぶだけの度胸が必要なのだわ。男が遊んでいるように、女も遊ばなくては、その度胸は出来ませんよ。でも身を持ち崩してしまうのは、男より女の方がやっぱり多いのです。女はもっと強い試練を経なければならないと思うわ」
これは、美代たちに、いつも語り聞かせる、美穂子が実践した哲学だった。

　　**四、母への逆襲**
美代が階下に降りたとき、カッと血液が頭脳に上り立つほどの衝動を受けた。じっとこちらを見ている、一人の男子学生の目とカチリと合った。男は、美代の家庭教師、谷岡だった。
「やっぱりここだった。僕は、あなたの行動を探っていたのです。あなたは、この頃どうかしている。ちっとも勉強なんかしないじゃありませんか。女学生の本道へ帰ってください」
谷岡は、いつもの冷厳たる調子で言った。
「本道ですって、本道とは何ですの？ 学校へ行き、予習、復習をして、夜は谷岡先生のお話を聴いて、日記を書かされて寝る。起きればまた同じことを繰り返す。これが本道ですの？」
「そうです。そうするのが女学生の本道です。枠を外れてはいけない。自由にも責任という枠があるのです」
「先生、わかったわ。もうたくさん。明日からは、その本道に帰るわ」
「それを聞けば、僕も安心しました。では一緒に帰りましょう」
「ねえ、先生、その代わり、明日……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Then a small hotel [I] was managing. Since returning to Osaka, [I] was just playing all the time. Meanwhile, Osaka's bombing happened, [my] husband burned to death and after that, in the post-war confusion, nothing could be done. Well, someday leisurely [I] shall tell [you] the story. Now, for me, [the café] Hanabana is all that remains.
"So, Auntie, even now are [you] alone?"
"Yes, I was always alone. A husband existed, but [he] was making several women. Since [I] was like an orphan, [I] grew up alone. But you see, my motto for living is, because [I] did more suffering, [I] cling to more pleasure."
Than that, Miyo, Mihoko's riddle-like words, clearly could not understand, but felt some kind of resonance that would heal the impatience of her own heart that she was seeking.

**3. The Peeked Secret**
"Miyo-chan too, has completely improved."
While dancing the Rumba, Mihoko said.
"It is Auntie's training after all."
Miyo, happily, the light rhythm, accurately stepped.
There, the two-story second floor, was a cozy hall of about twenty tatami mats. When students, receiving Mihoko's guidance, became able to step like adults, they paired with each other and danced. Mihoko, seeing that, could enjoy it alone. Miyo also paired with men, and came to dance boldly. Mihoko was feeling a strange interest in the growing of a "second Mihoko" and "third Mihoko."
"The reason women are weak is because they get pregnant. I have known many men, but did not get pregnant. I might be a 'stone woman' (barren), but... if a woman conceives, it's a loss."
Miyo felt as if her chest were suddenly struck. The purity taken at the embankment—the fear "did I perhaps conceive?" existed. But that man from that time, for some reason she yearned for that man. Every time she saw men of the "white line," Miyo could not even produce spirit.
"From now on, I think there will be various crises for Miyo-chan and the others, but you must never lose."
Mihoko was even providing sex education to Miyo as a mother substitute.
"You should try inspecting further past the second-floor toilet. [See] what kind of facilities are there. The seeds scattered irresponsibly by unfaithful men, [it] completely washes them away."
Miyo, as taught, peeked into the back of the toilet. It was washing equipment (douching/contraceptive equipment). Miyo, coming out of the toilet, suddenly discovered the door of the room that was Mihoko's bedroom/living room was open, and quietly peeked inside. The room was partitioned into three by curtains, and there were three beds. A corner of the bedding on the far bed was moving. Thinking "Oh?", she fixed her eyes. Miyo, who certainly felt the presence of people, held her breath and strained her ears. But, discovering under the furthest bed a woman's shoes and a man's shoes placed together, she immediately understood. The woman's shoes were without a doubt those of the schoolgirl who was dancing paired with a middle schooler until a while ago. The curtain was faintly trembling. The sound of heavy breathing could be heard. Miyo, who was standing stunned, suddenly felt the fire-like lips of the man who appeared at the embankment, her whole body was squeezed as if numbing, she remembered the sturdy body of that man, and the hot breath the man exhaled came back to life.
Miyo saw the true identity of the Café Hanabana. It was a dubious end/result full of students.
"Because the night is the world of adults, students absolutely cannot approach,"
Mihoko's words, for the first time, clicked for Miyo.
Why does Mihoko allow such things? Miyo could not believe in the mysterious Auntie called Mihoko.
"Women need the guts to just toy with men. Just as men are playing, unless women also play, that guts cannot be formed. But those who ruin themselves areやっぱり (after all) more women than men. I think women must go through stronger ordeals."
This was the philosophy Mihoko practiced, which she always told Miyo and the others.

**4. Counterattack against Mother**
When Miyo went downstairs, she received a shock as if blood surged to the brain. She locked eyes with a male student who was staring fixedly here. The man was Miyo's tutor, Tanioka.
"It was here after all. I was tracking your actions. You are somehow strange lately. You aren't studying at all, are you? Please return to the 'Proper Path' of a schoolgirl."
Tanioka said in his usual cold and stern tone.
"The 'Proper Path', you say? What is the Proper Path? Going to school, doing preparation and review, and at night listening to Mr. Tanioka's talk, being made to write a diary and sleeping. If [I] wake up, repeating the same thing again. Is this the Proper Path?"
"Yes. Doing so is the schoolgirl's Proper Path. You must not step outside the frame. Even in freedom, there is a frame called responsibility."
"Teacher, I understand. Enough already. From tomorrow, I will return to that Proper Path."
"Hearing that, I am also relieved. Then let us go home together."
"Hey, Teacher, instead of that, tomorrow..."

...back then, I was running a small hotel. After returning to Osaka, I spent my days in idleness. Then the air raids hit, my husband was killed in the fires, and in the chaos following the defeat, I found myself unable to do anything. Well, I'll tell you the whole story one of these days. For now, this café, *Hanabana*, is all I have left in this world."
"So, Auntie, are you still all alone even now?"
"Yes, I’ve always been alone. I had a husband, but he was always keeping other women. I grew up lonely, like an orphan. But you see, my motto for living is this: because I have suffered so much, I must cling to as much pleasure as I can find."
Miyo didn't quite grasp the riddle of Mihoko’s words, but they resonated with a certain restless longing in her own heart, offering a strange kind of comfort.

**3. The Secret Behind the Door**
"You’ve improved quite a lot, Miyo-chan," Mihoko said, as they moved through the steps of the rumba.
"It’s all thanks to your training, Auntie."
Miyo stepped accurately to the brisk rhythm, her face bright with joy.
The second floor was a cozy hall, about the size of twenty tatami mats. Once the students under Mihoko’s tutelage learned to step like adults, they would pair up and dance together. Watching them brought Mihoko a solitary kind of pleasure. Miyo, too, had begun to dance boldly with male partners. Mihoko took a peculiar interest in watching "second" and "third" versions of herself grow and develop.
"Women are weak because they get pregnant," Mihoko said. "I’ve known many men, but I never conceived. Perhaps I’m barren—a 'stone woman'—but regardless, if a woman gets pregnant, she loses the game."
Miyo felt a sharp pang in her chest. She lived with the constant terror that the virtue stolen from her at the riverbank might have left her pregnant. Yet, for some reason, she still pined for the man from that day. Whenever she saw the "men of the white line," she felt her spirit drain away.
"I expect you girls will face many crises from here on out, but you must never let yourselves be defeated."
Mihoko acted as a surrogate mother, even providing Miyo with a kind of sex education.
"Go and take a look at the room just past the upstairs toilet. See the facilities there. They are meant to wash away the seeds scattered so irresponsibly by unfaithful men."
Following these instructions, Miyo peeked into the back room. It was equipped with douching apparatus. As she left the area, she noticed the door to Mihoko’s combined bedroom and parlor was slightly ajar. She stole a look inside. The room was divided into three sections by curtains, with three beds. She noticed a corner of the bedding on the furthest bed moving. Startled, she focused her gaze. Feeling a definite human presence, she held her breath and listened. When she spotted a pair of women’s shoes and men’s shoes neatly lined up under the bed, the truth dawned on her. The shoes belonged to the schoolgirl who had been dancing with a middle school boy just moments before. The curtains trembled ever so slightly. She could hear the sound of heavy, labored breathing. Miyo stood there, stunned. Suddenly, she remembered the man on the riverbank—the heat of his lips like fire, the numbing sensation that had seized her whole body, the memory of his powerful frame. His hot breath seemed to come alive again in her mind.
Miyo had seen the true face of Café Hanabana. It was a sordid end-point for students.
"The night is a world for adults; students have no business here."
Mihoko’s earlier words finally made sense to Miyo.
*Why does she allow this?* Miyo wondered. She found it hard to believe in the mystery that was this woman she called Auntie.
"A woman needs the guts to toy with men," Mihoko’s philosophy went. "A woman must play just as men do, or she will never develop that strength. But it is true that women ruin their lives more often than men. That is why a woman must endure far harsher trials."

**4. Rebellion Against the Mother**
When Miyo reached the ground floor, she felt a shock so intense the blood seemed to boil in her head. Her eyes locked with those of a male student staring fixedly at her. It was Tanioka, her tutor.
"So you *were* here. I’ve been tracking your movements. You’ve been acting strangely lately. You aren't studying at all, are you? You must return to the 'Proper Path' of a schoolgirl."
Tanioka spoke in his usual cold, austere tone.
"The 'Proper Path'? And what, pray tell, is that? Going to school, preparing lessons, reviewing them, listening to your lectures at night, being forced to write in a diary, and then sleeping? Only to wake up and do it all again? Is *that* the Proper Path?"
"It is. That is the Proper Path for a schoolgirl. One must not step outside the framework. Even freedom exists within the framework of responsibility."
"I see, Teacher. I’ve heard enough. From tomorrow, I shall return to that 'path' of yours."
"I am relieved to hear it. Well then, let us go home together."
"Wait, Teacher. In exchange, tomorrow..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** This is a single-page layout with a vertical (tategaki) orientation, standard for Japanese literature. The text is dense, with section headers clearly marked in bold to denote a shift in narrative focus.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho style, characteristic of mid-Showa era printing. Small "ruby" characters (furigana) are used sparingly for more difficult kanji like 憔燥 (shōsō) and 嫉妬 (shitto - though not in this specific snippet, typical of the era).
*   **Punctuation:** It uses old-style punctuation marks (like "。" inside the closing quotation marks) and repetition marks (々 and 〻). The usage of 「わ。」 at the end of female speech is a dated but classic feminine marker in literature.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The section numbers (三、四) and titles act as the primary breaks in the narrative flow. The dialogue is indented, following standard Japanese literary formatting.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII/1950s):** The text explicitly mentions the bombing of Osaka and the "chaos of the defeat" (敗戦の混乱). This places the setting in the immediate post-war period or the early 1950s. The tension between "traditional" values (the "Proper Path") and the burgeoning Westernized/decadent youth culture (Rumba dancing, cafés) is a central theme.
*   **Café Culture:** Post-war "cafés" often doubled as dance halls or places for clandestine romantic/sexual encounters. The name "Hanabana" (Flowers/Brilliant) is typical for such establishments.
*   **The "Proper Path" (本道 - Hondō):** This refers to the strict social expectations placed on "Good Wives and Wise Mothers" (Ryōsai Kenbo) in training. For a schoolgirl, this meant academic diligence and moral purity.
*   **White Line (白線 - Hakusen):** This refers to the white band on student caps (specifically for high school boys/university students under the old system), identifying them as elite students but often associated in literature with the "pure" but troubled youth of the era.
*   **Rumba:** A popular dance in post-war Japan, representing the influx of Western (specifically Latin/American) culture that was seen as both exciting and morally questionable.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **石女 (Umazume / Ishionna):** Literally "stone woman." An archaic and derogatory term for a woman who is infertile or cannot conceive.
*   **憔燥 (Shōsō):** Irritability, impatience, or being fretful. It captures the psychological unrest of the protagonist.
*   **しこみ (Shikomi):** Training or apprenticeship. Usually used in the context of geisha or artisanal training, here used for dance/social etiquette.
*   **度胸 (Dokyō):** Courage, pluck, or "guts." Here, it is used in a cynical sense—having the nerve to treat men as playthings.
*   **本道 (Hondō):** The "right way" or "main path." It represents the rigid societal framework the protagonist is rebelling against.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Loss of Innocence:** Miyo's "purity" was taken at a riverbank (a common trope for sexual assault or illicit trysts in Showa literature). The story explores her navigating a world where "morality" is fractured.
*   **The Duality of Women:** Mihoko represents a cynical, "empowered" view of womanhood—using pleasure as a defense against the suffering caused by men. She stands in contrast to the "proper schoolgirl" image.
*   **Sexual Autonomy vs. Social Control:** The "washing equipment" (洗浄の設備) is a veiled reference to birth control/douching, highlighting the hidden reality of sexual activity in a society that preached purity.
*   **Intergenerational Trauma:** The "Auntie" character connects her current cynical worldview directly to her suffering during the war and her husband's infidelity.
*   **Generational Clash:** The tutor Tanioka represents the "old guard" or the "moral police," while Miyo represents a generation tempted by the "night world" and "pleasure."
