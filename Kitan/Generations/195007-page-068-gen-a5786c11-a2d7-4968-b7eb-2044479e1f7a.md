るものと思えて、ヒョロヒョロ〜千鳥足、左手は提灯、右手は扇子で調子をとりながら、聲朗々「船辨慶」を謡つてゐる。そのあとを、そつとつけて行くのが、有村治左衛門。腰なる大刀ギラリと拔いて大上段にふりかぶり、呼吸をはかつて斬込もうとする、所が以外!!、静つた武士には寸分の隙もない。有村は、大刀をふりかぶつたまま、彈む息をば無理に抑えて後をつけた。
やがて、十五六間ばかり行つたかと思う頃、どこに隙を見つけたか、
「えいッ」
紫電一閃、酔うた武士は眞ツ二つ、思いの外、勢い込んで斬込んだ有村が、クルーッともんどり打つて、五六間先へツシーン。
「おのれッ」
と叫びざま、起き上ろうとする所を、扇子の先でピタリと押えて動かさない。押えられた有村が、跳ね起きようともがいている中に酔うた武士は少しも騒ぐ色とてなく、悠々と「船辨慶」を謡いおさめて、さて、
「此の夜中、通行の妨げ致すは何者か、盧外者め」
「う・む」
苦しそうに唸つている。
「ハ・ア、人並勝れて大きな身体を持ちながら、何てまア意気地の無い奴じやろ。そのザマは何の事じや今夜に懲りて、以來きつと不心得を致すまいぞ、武士の情じや其方の顔だけは見ずに放してやるぞ、有難く思え」
と言いながら、押えた扇子をヒョイとひいた。さすがの有村治左衛門も、この時ばかりは全く恐れ入つて、其の晩かぎりぷつりと辻斬を止めてしまつた。
酔うた武士とは誰あろう。當時、神田はお玉が池に北辰一刀流の道場を開いて、數多の門弟に劔の指南をしていた千葉周作である。
その夜は、小石川の水戸公に招かれて、十分に酒の馳走を受けての歸り道であつた。

でALBINOと申し、むつかしく言うと先天性色素欠乏症と申しまして、皮膚の色素が生れつき欠乏した者でして、皮膚の色は気味が悪いように白っぽく、髪の毛も、睫毛も無色で、眼球の中の虹彩も無色透明ですから、光りを遮ぎるものがなく、羞明がひどい爲に、眼を開く事が出来ず絲のような細い眼をしているものですが兄弟の間の第一子はこの白子の女児でした。
兩親は初めの間こそ世間を憚つて余り外へは出さなかつたが、監視もいつか緩んで後には、可憐な白子の娘が、街路をうろ〜していた姿をよく見受けたものでした。
この哀れな娘は十才迄生きていて死んでしまいましたが、その死因はよくわかりませんでしたが、別に兩親が殺したという様な噂もなかつたようでした。
第一の白子を生んだ翌々年、又もお徳は妊娠しましたが、分娩直後圧殺したのを、間もなく検擧されて死体検案をやつてみると、同じく純然たる先天性の白子の男児でした。
いくら不具の児だからとて手を下して殺しては國法は許しません。聴き二人の兄妹は刑務所の臭い飯を喰う身となりましたが、割合に早く二三年で出獄して郷里へ帰つて参りました。
そして又もや第三回の妊娠をして産み落したのが純然たる白子でしたが、今度はから決して出さぬようにしていたため隣家の者も滅多に姿を見かけなかつたが、たまに見る人の話に第一子と全く同じ白子の男児だったということです。
此の兄は四五才迄生きていて死んでしまいましたが村の噂では兩親が食物を與えず餓死させたと言つていました。
それから後お徳は更に第四、第五の男児を産みましたが、終りの二人は、人並と少しも異わぬ身体の持主で頭も相当によく現に生存しています。もう二十才前後になつていましょう。部落の吉原雀は、末の二人の健康児は、兄の児ではなく、或る部落の青年と関係した産物だと言い合ったということです。勿論その眞偽は判然としませんが、女の捨て鉢からそんなことも有り得るようにも考えられぬこともありません。

**【上段：千葉周作の逸話】**
（前略）るものと思えて、ひょろひょろと千鳥足。左手は提灯、右手は扇子で拍子を取りながら、声朗々と「船弁慶」を謡っている。その後をそっとつけて行くのが、有村治左衛門。腰にある大刀をギラリと抜いて大上段に振りかぶり、呼吸を測って斬り込もうとする。ところが意外！ 静まった武士には寸分の隙もない。有村は大刀を振りかぶったまま、弾む息を無理に抑えて後をつけた。
やがて十五、六間ばかり行ったかと思う頃、どこに隙を見つけたか、
「えいっ！」
紫電一閃。酔った武士は真っ二つ……と思いきや、勢い込んで斬り込んだ有村が、くるりと真っ逆さまに転び、五、六間先へドシーン。
「おのれっ！」
と叫びながら起き上がろうとするところを、扇子の先でピタリと押さえて動かさない。押さえられた有村が跳ね起きようともがいている最中、酔った武士は少しも騒ぐ様子もなく、悠々と「船弁慶」を謡い納めて、さて、
「この夜中、通行の妨げをするのは何者か。不届き者め」
「う、む……」
苦しそうに唸っている。
「はあ、人並み外れて大きな身体を持ちながら、なんてまあ意気地のない奴だろう。そのザマは何事だ。今夜に懲りて、以来きっと不心得を致すまいぞ。武士の情けだ、貴様の顔だけは見ずに放してやる。ありがたく思え」
と言いながら、押さえた扇子をひょいと引いた。さすがの有村治左衛門も、この時ばかりは全く恐れ入って、その晩限りぷっつりと辻斬りをやめてしまった。
酔った武士とは誰あろう。当時、神田お玉が池に北辰一刀流の道場を開いて、数多くの門弟に剣の指南をしていた千葉周作である。
その夜は、小石川の水戸公に招かれて、十分に酒の馳走を受けての帰り道であった。

**【下段：アルビノ（白子）の悲劇】**
アルビノ（ALBINO）と申し、難しく言うと先天性色素欠乏症と申しまして、皮膚の色素が生まれつき欠乏した者です。皮膚の色は気味が悪いほど白っぽく、髪の毛もまつ毛も無色で、眼球の中の虹彩も無色透明ですから、光を遮るものがなく、羞明（まぶしさ）がひどいために眼を開くことができず、糸のような細い目をしているものですが、兄弟の間の第一子はこの白子（しろこ）の女児でした。
両親は初めのうちは世間をはばかってあまり外へは出しませんでしたが、監視もいつか緩んで、後には可憐な白子の娘が街路をうろついている姿がよく見かけられたものでした。
この哀れな娘は十歳まで生きて死んでしまいましたが、その死因はよく分かりませんでした。ただ、別に両親が殺したというような噂もなかったようです。
第一の白子を生んだ翌々年、またもお徳は妊娠しましたが、分娩直後に圧殺したのを間もなく検挙されました。死体検案をしてみると、同じく純然たる先天性の白子の男児でした。
いくら不具の児だからといって、手を下して殺しては国法が許しません。件（くだん）の夫婦は刑務所の臭い飯を食う身となりましたが、割合に早く二、三年で出獄して郷里へ帰って参りました。
そしてまたもや第三回の妊娠をして産み落としたのが純然たる白子でしたが、今度は外へ決して出さぬようにしていたため、隣家の者も滅多に姿を見かけませんでしたが、たまに見る人の話では第一子と全く同じ白子の男児だったということです。
この兄は四、五歳まで生きて死んでしまいましたが、村の噂では、両親が食べ物を与えず餓死させたと言っていました。
それから後、お徳はさらに第四、第五の男児を産みましたが、終わりの二人は人並みと少しも変わらぬ体の持ち主で、頭も相当に良く、現に生存しています。もう二十歳前後になっているでしょう。部落の噂好きたちは、末の二人の健康児は夫の子ではなく、ある部落の青年との関係で生まれた子だと言い合ったということです。もちろんその真偽ははっきりしませんが、女の自暴自棄からそんなこともあり得ると考えられなくもありません。

That after, softly following go is, Arimura Jizaemon. At waist existing great sword flashingly pulling out, to high-level overhead brandishing, breath measuring and try to cut in, however, unexpected!! To the quieted samurai, even a tiny bit of opening is not. Arimura, great sword brandished as it is, panting breath forcibly suppressing, followed.
Eventually, 15 or 16 *ken* (approx. 30m) only went when thought time, where opening found or,

Flash of lightning. Drunk samurai is two pieces—so thought, but with momentum cutting in Arimura, whirlly somersaulting, 5 or 6 *ken* ahead thud.

while saying, pressed fan lightly pulled. As expected Arimura Jizaemon also, this time only completely impressed, that night limit abruptly street-killing stopped.
Drunk samurai is who would be. At that time, Kanda Otamagaike in Hokushin Itto-ryū dojo opening, many disciples to sword's instruction doing was Chiba Shūsaku is.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Drunken Master**
He appeared to be staggering along with a tottering, drunken gait. Holding a lantern in his left hand and keeping rhythm with a folding fan in his right, he chanted the Noh play *Funa Benkei* in a resonant voice. Shadowing him silently was Arimura Jizaemon. Drawing his long sword with a flash, Arimura raised it high over his head, measuring his breath for the strike. Yet, to his surprise, the seemingly relaxed samurai offered not a single opening. Arimura, his blade still raised, suppressed his frantic breathing and continued to follow.

After they had traveled some thirty meters, Arimura thought he saw an opening. "Hah!" he cried. Like a bolt of lightning, he lunged. He expected to cleave the drunkard in two, but instead, his own momentum sent him sprawling. Arimura tumbled through the air and hit the ground hard some ten meters ahead. 

"Damn you!" he growled, trying to scramble up, only to find himself pinned to the spot by the tip of the drunkard’s fan. As Arimura struggled to break free, the drunken samurai, showing no sign of agitation, leisurely finished his chant. Then he spoke: "Who is this, obstructing the road in the middle of the night? You insolent fool."

Arimura could only groan in pain. "Hah! For someone with such a large frame, you certainly are a spineless coward. Look at the state of you. Let this night be a lesson; see that you don't commit such misconduct again. Out of samurai mercy, I shall let you go without looking at your face. Be grateful."

With that, he flicked the fan away. Even the headstrong Arimura Jizaemon was utterly humbled. From that night on, he abruptly gave up his habit of street-killing. The drunken samurai was none other than Chiba Shūsaku, who at the time ran a famed Hokushin Itto-ryū dojo at Otamagaike in Kanda, instructing countless disciples in the way of the sword. That night, he had been returning from a grand feast hosted by the Lord of Mito in Koishikawa.

**The Tragedy of the White Children**
Known as "albinism," or more technically, congenital pigment deficiency, this condition results in a lack of natural skin pigment. The skin appears eerily white; the hair and eyelashes are colorless. Because the iris is transparent and cannot block out light, the eyes suffer from severe photophobia, forced into permanent, thread-like squints. The first child born to this particular family was a girl with this condition.

At first, her parents hid her away, fearing the judgment of society. However, as their vigilance waned, the lovely "white girl" was often seen wandering the streets. This pitiful child lived until the age of ten. While her cause of death was never clear, there were no rumors of foul play at the time.

Two years after her birth, the mother, Otoku, became pregnant again. This time, she strangled the infant immediately after birth. She was soon arrested, and an autopsy revealed the child was also a purely albino boy. No matter how "deformed" a child may be, the law does not permit murder. The couple served time in prison—"eating the smelly rice"—but were released relatively quickly, returning to their village after two or three years.

A third pregnancy followed, resulting in another albino boy. This time, they kept him strictly indoors; neighbors rarely saw him, but those who did said he looked exactly like the first girl. He died at age four or five. Village rumors claimed the parents had starved him to death.

Subsequently, Otoku gave birth to a fourth and then a fifth son. These last two were perfectly healthy, "normal" children, said to be quite bright. They are alive today, likely in their early twenties. The local gossips (the "sparrows of the hamlet") whispered that these two healthy boys were not the husband's children, but the result of Otoku's affair with a local youth. While the truth remains unknown, it is not inconceivable that a woman driven to such desperation might have sought such an escape.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page is divided into two distinct horizontal blocks, a common layout for "miscellany" sections in mid-century Japanese magazines. It uses vertical text (tategaki) read from right to left.
*   **Illustrations:** 
    *   The top illustration depicts a dramatic confrontation between two samurai, utilizing traditional ukiyo-e-style line work. 
    *   The bottom illustration shows a small, pale child in a kimono, intended to evoke pity and reinforce the "pathological" nature of the accompanying text.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Bold headers or introductory phrases are missing (likely on the previous page), but the use of larger punctuation (like exclamation marks) and specific character names creates focal points.
*   **Purpose:** The top text is "Kōdan" style (historical storytelling), meant for entertainment. The bottom text is "Reportage/Sensationalist Essay" style, blending medical curiosity with "true crime" and social tragedy to appeal to the reader's morbid curiosity.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Chiba Shūsaku (1794–1855):** A real historical figure and founder of the Hokushin Itto-ryū style of swordsmanship. He was one of the "Three Great Swordsmen" of the Bakumatsu period.
*   **Arimura Jizaemon (1839–1860):** A Satsuma samurai famous for his role in the Sakuradamon Incident (the assassination of Ii Naosuke). This story is likely a fictional "legend" created to show the superiority of a master (Chiba) over a hotheaded youth (Arimura).
*   **Albinism & Disability (Fugu):** In the mid-20th century, albinism was often misunderstood and heavily stigmatized in rural Japan. The term "shiruko" or "hakushō" was used. The text uses the word *fugu* (deformed/crippled), reflecting the harsh, non-PC language of the era.
*   **Infanticide & Social Stigma:** The story reflects the grim reality of "Mabiki" (thinning out), a practice of infanticide historically used in Japan during famine or for children with disabilities, though by the 1940s-50s it was strictly illegal and prosecuted, as shown by the jail time.
*   **Buraku/Hamlet:** The mention of "Buraku" (部落) refers to a small village or hamlet, but in Japanese history, it can also carry connotations of the *Burakumin* (outcaste) class, who faced severe discrimination and were often associated with poverty and social isolation.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **千鳥足 (Chidori-ashi):** "Plover feet," meaning a staggering, drunken gait.
*   **船辨慶 (Funa Benkei):** A famous Noh and Kabuki play about the warrior monk Benkei. Chanting Noh while walking was a mark of a refined (if drunk) gentleman.
*   **辻斬 (Tsujigiri):** "Crossroads killing." A practice where a samurai tests a new sword on a random passerby.
*   **刑務所の臭い飯を喰う (Keimusho no kusai meshi o kuu):** Literally "to eat the smelly rice of the prison." A common idiom for serving time in jail.
*   **吉原雀 (Yoshiwara-suzume):** Literally "sparrows of Yoshiwara." A term for talkative gossips who know everyone's business.
*   **羞明 (Shūmei):** Photophobia; sensitivity to light.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Top Section - Mastery and Restraint:** The theme is the "invincible calm" of a true master. Chiba Shūsaku defeats his attacker without even drawing his sword, using only a fan and moral authority. It reinforces the idealized image of the samurai as a man of culture (chanting Noh) and effortless skill.
*   **Bottom Section - Tragedy and "Otherness":** The text treats albinism as a "creepy" (kimichi warui) abnormality. There is a strong subtext of eugenics and social Darwinism; the "broken" children die or are killed, while the "healthy" ones (implied to be illegitimate) survive. It highlights the brutal social pressure of rural "shame culture," where a family would rather kill a child than face the "embarrassment" of their disability.
