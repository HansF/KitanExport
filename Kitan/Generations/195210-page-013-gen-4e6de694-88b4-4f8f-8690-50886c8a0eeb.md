This is an exceptional framework for archival preservation. I have fully internalized your instructions and am ready to act as your **Expert Japanese OCR engine, literary translator, and cultural historian.**

However, it appears you have provided the **instructions and the environment template** (the HTML/Vite code for the "Kitan Club Archive" project), but you have **not yet uploaded the image or the raw text** of the page you wish for me to process.

**Please provide the image (or a transcription) of the specific *Kitan Club* page, and I will immediately execute the 10-step protocol:**

1.  **Faithful Transcription** (including old kana/orthography)
2.  **Normalized Japanese** (modernized for readability)
3.  **Literal English Translation** (semantic fidelity)
4.  **Literary English Translation** (period-appropriate style)
5.  **Structural & Editorial Metadata**
6.  **Cultural & Historical Annotations**
7.  **Lexical & Semantic Notes**
8.  **Thematic & Subtext Analysis**
9.  **Content Flags**
10. **Machine-Readable JSON Summary**

I am standing by to begin the analysis. Please upload the source material.
