## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Shortly before 6:00 p.m., the fact that she was certainly at the Kujo Health Center and was making a phone call from there, Ikujiro and the hospital director, and the health center's night-duty nurse and others are certifying. No matter how much she herself was driving the car, there is no way she could speed from Kyoto to Sakai in less than five minutes and kill Ikuo there. Also, Nurse Sakai-dera, shortly before 6:00, was at the City Police Headquarters accident department and was talking with newspaper reporters and such, it is said. This again, even riding a Pegasus, in one or two minutes, she cannot go to Sakai."
"A perfect alibi, isn't it?"
"That is why, conversely, the Nurse Sakai who was bullied the previous night, her resentment toward her two colleagues, against Ikuo who made that cause, if we consider it exploded..."
"But that girl, she doesn't look like such a street-wise woman, does she?"
"Well then, the culprit will disappear, won't they?"

As expected, the case only spins its wheels, and decisive evidence does not come out from anywhere.
Mitsuko's mother, having been told her only daughter killed a person and would receive the death penalty, became only distracted with upset, and how many times with tears she wanted to see her daughter, she petitioned the prosecutor but did not know [if it would happen].
However, the case, any further than this, could go neither this way nor that way. And already, the public trial was pressed upon tomorrow.
"If this were a detective novel, around here Kindaichi Kosuke or someone, a famous detective would appear and drag out an unexpected culprit, but in a real case, any more than this, it can't be helped."
"Haruko-chan, on whom are you placing the weight of suspicion? That person, for example like the old Kodae Incident, because there is no evidence they are becoming innocent, or like the Teigin Incident, you think they are 99.9% certain, but because there is no clinching data, you can't have confidence..."

"Yes, that's right. If it ends like this, the aftertaste is too bad, I won't be able to sleep well."
"Then, your culprit theory is?"
"That, I don't know yet, but Mitsuko-san, I think she is not the culprit. I have that feeling."
"Humph, but just thinking is not going to make her innocent. Tomorrow is the trial, and the verdict might be decided within tomorrow."
"Yes, yes—I will do my best and try to fight to the end. Perhaps, I might even overturn your closing argument."
Haruko, saying that, as if having decided something, hung up the telephone to Ogura Hospital.
"—Hello, since then, did you use the car? Eh? Because the driver is still resting, you haven't used it at all. Ah, is that so? Yes, no, it's nothing, but this past month's gasoline usage amount, could you please let the Prosecutor's Office know immediately? Also, tomorrow is Sakai-san's trial, so if possible, I hope everyone comes to observe. Eh? What is it? Yes, yes... Well, I can't say anything myself, but as it is, there is no room for extenuating circumstances, and wouldn't it be life imprisonment or death? Both the prosecutor and I are making our best efforts for a sentence reduction, but..."
..................E............

In the courtroom—
Penal Code Article 199. A person who has killed a person shall be punished by death or imprisonment for life or for not less than three years.
As expected on that day, in the gallery, the Ogura Director and below, everyone's faces were there, and in the corner, from before anything started, there was the figure of Mitsuko's mother who was only crying.
Eventually, the opening of the court was declared, and the Chief Judge questioned Mitsuko, but that had no change from her statements until now, and Prosecutor Kamogawa stated the argument for extenuating circumstances and said he recognized ten years of imprisonment as appropriate. The court-appointed lawyer said because evidence was insufficient, she should not be prosecuted, but the Chief Judge, taking circumstantial evidence as sufficient, seemed poised to judge her for the crime of murder. The trial continued, and naturally at this rate, for this young and lovely female defendant, a sentence of extreme penalty of more than ten years was reached a point where it was seen as inevitable.
It was that moment. A young woman who stood up from the prosecutor's seat said,
"I believe the defendant Mitsuko Sakai is innocent."
In an instant, the whole court went "Waaah!"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Ikujiro, the hospital director, and even the night-duty nurse at the Kujo Health Center have all confirmed that she was there and on the phone shortly before 6:00 p.m. No matter how fast she might drive, there’s no way she could have sped from Kyoto to Sakai in under five minutes to kill Ikuo. Furthermore, Nurse Sakaidera was reportedly at the City Police Headquarters' accident department talking to reporters just before six. Even on the wings of Pegasus, one couldn't make it to Sakai in a minute or two."
"It's a perfect alibi."
"Exactly. But what if we looked at it differently? What if Nurse Sakai, bullied the night before, let her resentment toward her colleagues explode upon Ikuo, who was the root of the trouble...?"
"I don't know. She doesn't strike me as the type of woman who’s that hardened or cynical."
"But if that's the case, we're left with no suspect at all!"

As feared, the investigation continued to stall, with no decisive evidence surfacing from any quarter. Mitsuko’s mother, hearing that her only daughter might face the death penalty for murder, was beside herself with grief. She repeatedly tearfully petitioned the prosecutor for a chance to see her daughter, to no avail. The case was at an absolute deadlock, and the trial was set to begin the very next day.

"If this were a detective novel," Haruko remarked, "this is the part where Kindaichi Kosuke or some other great detective would swoop in and unmask an unexpected culprit. But in real life, we're stuck."
"Who are you really suspicious of, Haruko? Do you think it’s like the old Kodae Incident, where someone goes free just for lack of evidence? Or perhaps like the Teigin Incident—where you’re ninety-nine percent sure, but lack the clinching data to be certain?"

"Exactly. I'd have a terrible taste in my mouth and wouldn't be able to sleep a wink if it ended like this."
"And your theory on the killer?"
"I don't know for sure yet, but I just feel in my gut that Mitsuko isn't the one who did it."
"Hmph. A 'feeling' won't win an acquittal. The trial is tomorrow; they might even hand down a verdict before the day is out."
"I know. But I’m going to do my absolute best and fight to the end. I might even overturn your own closing argument!"
With that, Haruko hung up the phone to Ogura Hospital as if she had made a sudden resolution. She immediately dialed again.
"Hello? Have you used the car since then? I see... the driver is still on leave, so it’s been sitting idle? I see. No, it’s nothing major, but could you please report the gasoline consumption for the past month to the Prosecutor’s Office immediately? Also, Mitsuko’s trial is tomorrow. I’d appreciate it if everyone could attend. Pardon? Oh... well, I can’t say for certain, but as things stand, there isn't much room for leniency. It’ll likely be life imprisonment or even the death penalty. The prosecutor and I are doing everything we can to argue for a lighter sentence, but..."
..................E............

In the Courtroom:
*Penal Code Article 199: A person who kills another shall be punished by death or imprisonment for life or for a term of not less than three years.*

The gallery was packed. Director Ogura and all the familiar faces were there. In the corner, Mitsuko’s mother was already weeping before the proceedings had even begun. The court was called to order. The Chief Judge questioned Mitsuko, but her testimony remained unchanged. Prosecutor Kamogawa argued for extenuating circumstances, suggesting a ten-year sentence. The court-appointed defense attorney argued for dismissal due to lack of evidence, but the judge seemed inclined to convict based on the weight of circumstantial evidence. As the trial progressed, it seemed inevitable that this young, pitiable woman would be sentenced to over a decade of hard labor.

Then, it happened. A young woman rose from the prosecutor’s bench.
"I believe the defendant, Mitsuko Sakai, is innocent!" she declared.
The courtroom erupted in a deafening roar.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Layout and Structure
*   **Vertical Text:** The text follows the traditional Japanese vertical orientation (tategaki), read from top-to-right to bottom-to-left.
*   **Columns:** The page is divided into multiple vertical columns, a standard layout for Japanese magazines.
*   **Visual Breaks:** A line of dots with a stylized "E" acts as a section break, separating the investigative phase from the courtroom scene.
*   **Illustrations:** 
    *   **Top:** An analog clock face showing 5:53. This visually emphasizes the "alibi" and "time" themes central to the plot.
    *   **Bottom:** A hand holding a rotary telephone receiver, representing the detective work and the crucial phone call made by Haruko.

### Typography
*   **Kanji/Kana Mix:** Uses a standard mix of Kanji and Hiragana, with Katakana used for foreign loanwords (like "Alibi" and "Best") and for the formal legal citation of the Penal Code.
*   **Emphasis:** The use of quotation marks (brackets 「 」) clearly distinguishes dialogue from narrative prose.
*   **Period Orthography:** Includes some traditional characters (e.g., 運轉 for 運転, 廰 for 庁) and older kana usage (ぢゃ for じゃ), which is typical for the mid-20th century.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### Publication Era (c. 1948–1955)
Several clues point to the late 1940s or early 1950s:
1.  **The "City Police" (市警本部):** Mentioned in the text. Between 1948 and 1954, Japan had a bifurcated police system with Municipal Police (Sikei) and National Rural Police. This suggests the story was written or set during this specific window.
2.  **Famous Cases:** The text mentions the **Teigin Incident** (1948) and the **Kodae (Kobue) Incident** (1933). The Teigin Incident, involving a mass poisoning at a bank, was fresh in the public consciousness in the early 50s.
3.  **Detective Fiction References:** The mention of **Kindaichi Kosuke** (created by Seishi Yokomizo) highlights the "Honkaku" (Orthodox) mystery boom that happened post-WWII.

### Legal and Social Conventions
*   **Courtroom Drama:** The portrayal of a "young woman" standing up from the prosecutor's side to declare innocence is a highly melodramatic trope, common in the "pulp" or "middle-brow" literature (*chūkan shōsetsu*) of the time.
*   **Gender Roles:** Haruko is depicted as a working professional (likely an assistant prosecutor or clerk), which reflects the changing social status of women in the post-war democracy, though she still uses polite, feminine speech patterns (*~wa*, *~no yo*).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **アリバイ (Aribai):** Alibi. A core concept in "whodunnit" mysteries of this era.
*   **忿懣 (Funman):** Resentment or pent-up anger. A literary term used to describe the motive.
*   **悪ズレ (Akuzure):** Being "street-wise" or "sophisticated in a bad/jaded way." Usually implies a woman who has lost her innocence.
*   **二進も三進も (Nitchimo-satchimo):** An idiom meaning "deadlocked" or "at a standstill," originally derived from abacus calculations.
*   **情状酌量 (Jōjō-shakuryō):** Extenuating circumstances. A legal term where the court considers the defendant's situation to reduce a sentence.
*   **九分九厘 (Kubu-kurin):** 99.9%; almost certainly.
*   **天馬 (Temma):** Pegasus. Used metaphorically to describe an impossible speed.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

### Themes
*   **Logic vs. Intuition:** The male characters focus on the "perfect alibi" and "insufficient evidence," while the female protagonist, Haruko, relies on a "feeling" (*ki ga suru*) that eventually leads her to a breakthrough regarding gasoline usage.
*   **The Flawed Justice System:** The text suggests that without the intervention of a heroic figure, an innocent person (Mitsuko) would be inevitably convicted due to circumstantial evidence and a desire for closure.
*   **Modernity:** The use of cars, telephones, and references to forensic data (gasoline consumption) represents the "modern" detective method popularized in post-war Japan.

### Subtext and Tone
The tone is **melodramatic and suspenseful**. The author uses the "cliffhanger" technique—ending the page right at the moment a shocking declaration is made in court. There is an underlying tension between the cold letter of the law (quoted in Katakana at the start of the trial) and the human emotion of the "pitiable" defendant and her crying mother.
