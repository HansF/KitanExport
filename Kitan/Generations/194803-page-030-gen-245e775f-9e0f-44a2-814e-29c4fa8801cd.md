**パンパンガール殺人事件**
**杉山清詩**
**紫荘児**

（一）

まるで十六娘のお乳のように、猫柳がポツツリ膨んで来る春三月の深夜。近所の抱月荘アパートを管理している小母さんに拝み倒されて、晴子は寝入端を起され、襟をかき合せ乍ら月白い夜道を急いでいた。
「それが何しろまだ二十になったばかりの娘が、素ッ裸で心臓をズブツと抉られているんでしょう。驚くの驚かないのつて、アパート中大騒動ですよ。えゝ、男と寝ていたんです。山野三夫つて同じうちのアパートに居る過剰物資移動業。つまり早く言えば闇屋ですね。その男に抱かれて青春を禮讃していた最中にグサツとやられたんですが、男はどうしても知らないと言ふんです。とにかく警察へ取調べて下さいよ。何しろ帝銀毒殺事件以上の大事件なんですから、慎重にお願いしますよ」
首ばかり前へ突出して、心焦り乍ら駈けて行く小母さんの説明は、しどろもどろでさっぱり要領を得ない。
この呼出された娘、青空晴子というのは、本職は寶塚劇出身のソプラノ歌手なのだが、最近数多の怪事件をバリバリと解決した、素人女流探偵としての名声の方が、巷間にはよく知られているという頼もしき（？）乙女である。今日も抱月荘に起った殺人事件、丁度彼女の家も近いし、まして裸体娘の房に起った事件だけに、荒々しい男性に踏込まれるよりはと小母さん大いに気を利かした所なのである。
もう十二時近い頃なのに、事件の御座で止宿人は殆ど全部起きていたし、彼女の後姿を見送って何か囁き合ったりしていた。
「この室なんですがね、何しろ血みどろでとても酷い有様ですから、気を失わないで下さいよ」
小母さんはそう言って惨劇の室を開けた。コの字型に建つているこのアパートの左の棟の一番奥、十二号室、津田美代子、小母さんの説明によるとデパートガールで、大阪での戦災者、縁故のない独り者だそうだ。
一歩室へ入るとプンと鼻を衝く烈しい血の香。四畳半の中央に夜具が敷いてあり、その上に着物も肌着も全部脱棄てられていたが娘独り暮しの筈が枕が二ツ、使用済の櫻紙が枕元の煤けた襖に、白くついた。美代子の死体は夜具からはみ出して、丸裸になって窓際に仰向に倒れていた。かなり豊熟した左乳房附近は夥しい鮮血に彩られ、それが真珠の肌の色を一層凄い程に引立たせている。致命傷は心臓部の一刺し。しかし兇器は刃物ではないらしい。何か先の尖った棒のようなものだろう。傷口は丸くて深かつた。
晴子は一應の検屍を終ると、今宵被害者と食を共にした。山野三夫という青年をそこへ呼んだ。
「今迄の経過をお話し願いませんか」
そう切出されると、断じて犯人は僕ぢゃありませんと前提してから、彼はぼつぼつと事件に就いてこう語り始めた。
「美代子さんは今迄に何度か僕に肌を許してくれていますので、今夜もそつと誘ってみるとすぐ承知してくれました。近所の室がうるさいので、皆が寝静まるのを待って来ましたので、此室へ来たのは十時過ぎてからでした。勿論美代子さんは待っていてくれたので、それからなにをしたですが、僕も充分楽しませて貰ったし美代子さんも疲れたからもう室へ帰ろうと思ったら、十一時を過ぎていました。そこで僕は便所へ行つたのですが、今度この室へ帰つて来てみるともうこの始末です。
美代子さんは胸からガブガブ血を噴出して倒れていたので、僕は吃驚仰天して、思わず人殺しだ、誰か来てくれエッ！と叫んだら、皆様呆けた顔で駈け付けて来てくれました。僕の知つているのはたゞそれだけです。僕は全然犯人も知らなければ、ほんの便所に入つていた僅かの間にこんな事になつてしまっていたのです」
「その犯行前後に、何所かまだ起きていた室はなかったでしょうか、例えば窓から明りが洩れていたとか便所へ行く時誰かに会ったとか──」
「灯も消えていたし、全然足音なども聞えなかったようですが、起きていたと言えば、その少し前に、この丁度向いの室に人影がしていたようでした」
「向いつて、此所の窓が閉めてあれば見えないぢゃありませんか」
「えゝ、それがその、向うは電燈を消していたので気が付かなかったんですが、どうやら僕らのやつていた事を向側から見られていたらいいんで──」

まるで十六歳の娘のお乳のように、猫柳がぽつりぽつりと膨らんでくる春三月の深夜。近所の「抱月荘」アパートを管理しているおばさんに拝み倒されて、晴子は寝入りばなを起こされ、襟をかき合わせながら月白い夜道を急いでいた。
「それが何しろ、まだ二十歳になったばかりの娘が、真っ裸で心臓をズブりと抉られているんでしょう。驚くの驚かないのって、アパート中大騒動ですよ。ええ、男と寝ていたんです。山野三夫っていう同じアパートにいる過剰物資移動業。つまり、はっきり言えば闇屋ですね。その男に抱かれて青春を礼讃していた最中にグサリとやられたんですが、男はどうしても知らないと言うんです。とにかく警察へ取り調べて下さいよ。何しろ帝銀毒殺事件以上の大事件なんですから、慎重にお願いしますよ」

もう十二時近い頃なのに、事件の現場で同居人はほとんど全員起きていたし、彼女の後ろ姿を見送って何か囁き合ったりしていた。

一歩部屋へ入ると、ぷんと鼻を突く激しい血の臭い。四畳半の中央に夜具が敷いてあり、その上に着物も肌着も全部脱ぎ捨てられていたが、娘の一人暮らしのはずが枕が二つ。使用済みの落とし紙が枕元の煤けた襖に、白く散っていた。美代子の死体は夜具からはみ出して、丸裸になって窓際に仰向けに倒れていた。かなり豊満な左乳房付近は夥しい鮮血に彩られ、それが真珠のような肌の色を一層凄まじいほどに引き立たせている。致命傷は心臓部の一刺し。しかし凶器は刃物ではないらしい。何か先の尖った棒のようなものだろう。傷口は丸くて深かった。

「向かいって、ここの窓が閉めてあれば見えないじゃありませんか」

Just like a sixteen-year-old girl's breasts, the pussy willow is budding—late at night in the spring of March. Being entreated by the middle-aged lady (Obasan) who manages the nearby Hogetsu-so apartment, Haruko was woken up just as she fell asleep, and while pulling her collar together, she hurried along the moon-white night road.
"Regardless, a girl who has just turned twenty was found buck naked with her heart gouged out with a stab. Whether surprised or not, the whole apartment is in an uproar. Yes, she was sleeping with a man. Yamano Mitsuo, who lives in the same apartment, in the 'surplus goods movement' business. In other words, to speak plainly, a black marketeer. In the middle of being held by that man and praising youth, she was stabbed, but the man says he definitely doesn't know. Anyway, please investigate for the police. Since it's a major incident even greater than the Teikoku Bank poisoning case, please proceed cautiously."
With only her head thrust forward, the Obasan's explanation as she ran impatiently was incoherent and didn't get to the point at all.
This girl who was called out, Aozora Haruko, her main profession is a soprano singer from the Takarazuka Revue, but lately, her reputation as an amateur female detective who has solved many strange cases is better known among the public—a dependable (?) maiden. Today's murder case at Hogetsu-so, since her house is close, and especially because it was a case in a naked girl's room, the Obasan used great tact thinking it better than having rough men barge in.
Although it was nearly 12 o'clock, almost all the lodgers were awake at the scene of the incident, and they were whispering to each other while watching her back as she arrived.
"It's this room, but it's bloody and in a terrible state, so please don't lose consciousness."
The Obasan said so and opened the room of the tragedy. Located at the very back of the left wing of this U-shaped apartment, Room 12. Tsuda Miyako. According to the Obasan's explanation, a department store girl, a war victim from Osaka, a lone person without relatives.
Stepping into the room, a violent scent of blood hit the nose. In the center of the four-and-a-half mat room, bedding was laid out, and upon it, kimono and undergarments were all discarded, but though it was supposed to be a girl living alone, there were two pillows. Used cherry blossom paper (tissue) was scattered white against the soot-stained sliding door by the pillows. Miyako's corpse was sticking out from the bedding, lying naked on her back by the window. The area near her quite ripe left breast was colored with a vast amount of fresh blood, which made the pearl-like skin color stand out all the more dreadfully. The fatal wound was a single thrust to the heart. However, the murder weapon doesn't seem to be a blade. Probably something like a pointed stick. The wound was round and deep.
Haruko, having finished a preliminary examination of the corpse, called the young man Yamano Mitsuo, who had shared a meal with the victim this evening, to that place.
"Won't you please tell me the course of events until now?"
When prompted like that, after first stating "The criminal is definitely not me," he began to speak bit by bit about the incident like this.
"Miyako-san has allowed me her skin several times before, so when I quietly invited her tonight, she immediately agreed. Because the nearby rooms are noisy, I waited for everyone to fall asleep before coming, so it was after 10 o'clock when I came to this room. Of course, Miyako-san was waiting for me, so we did 'that,' and I was allowed to enjoy sufficiently, and Miyako-san was tired so I thought to return to my room, it was past 11. Then I went to the toilet, but when I came back to this room this time, it was already this mess.
Miyako-san was collapsed with blood gushing from her chest, so I was startled out of my wits and unintentionally shouted 'It's a murder, someone come!', then everyone came running with dazed faces. What I know is only that. I don't know the criminal at all; in just the short time I was in the toilet, it had become like this."
"Before and after that crime, wasn't there any room that was still awake? For example, light leaking from a window or meeting someone when going to the toilet—"
"The lights were out, and I didn't seem to hear footsteps at all, but if I say who was awake, a little before that, there seemed to be a human shadow in the room directly opposite this one."
"Opposite? If the window here is closed, can't you not see?"
"Yes, well, that's... the other side had the lights off so I didn't notice, but it seems what we were doing was being watched from the opposite side—"

**The Pan-pan Girl Murder Case**
**By Seishi Sugiyama & Sōji Murasaki**

(1)

Late on a midnight in March, the pussy willows were beginning to swell like the breasts of a young girl. Haruko, roused from the edge of sleep by the desperate pleas of the landlady of the nearby Hogetsu-so Apartments, hurried through the moonlit streets, clutching her collar against the chill.
"Listen, she was barely twenty, found stone-dead and stark naked with her heart carved right out! You can't imagine the uproar—the whole building is in a panic. Yes, she was in bed with a man—Yamano Mitsuo, one of those black-market types living in the same house. He was right there with her, celebrating their youth, when she was stabbed. But he swears he knows nothing! Please, you must investigate before the police arrive. This is a bigger scandal than the Teigin Poisoning Case; you must be careful!"
The landlady’s explanation was a breathless, muddled mess as she scurried along, head thrust forward in her haste.
The woman she had summoned, Aozora Haruko, was a soprano formerly of the Takarazuka Revue. However, her fame lately rested more on her reputation as a formidable amateur lady detective who had cracked several bizarre cases. Given that the murder occurred in the room of a naked girl, the landlady had used her wits, deciding it was better to call for Haruko than to have rough, insensitive men trampling through the scene.
Despite the late hour, the lodgers were all awake, whispering in the shadows as they watched Haruko pass.
"It’s this room. It’s a bloodbath, a truly gruesome sight... please, don't faint," the landlady warned as she threw open the door. Room 12, at the far end of the U-shaped building's left wing. The victim was Tsuda Miyako. According to the landlady, she was a department store clerk, a war refugee from Osaka with no living relatives.
A step inside, and the thick, iron scent of blood stung the nostrils. In the center of the four-and-a-half mat room lay the bedding. Her kimono and undergarments had been tossed aside, but despite her living alone, there were two pillows. Used tissues lay scattered like white petals against the soot-grimed sliding doors. Miyako’s body had sprawled off the futon, lying naked and face-up by the window. Her full left breast was stained with a horrific amount of fresh blood, the crimson making her pearl-pale skin look agonizingly beautiful. The fatal blow was a single thrust to the heart, but the wound was round and deep—not the work of a blade, but some sort of sharpened stake.
After a brief examination, Haruko summoned Yamano Mitsuo, the youth who had been with her that night.
"Tell me everything," she commanded.
"I didn't do it, I swear!" he blurted out before beginning his tale. "Miyako and I... we'd been intimate before. I slipped into her room after ten, once the neighbors had quieted down. She was waiting for me. We enjoyed ourselves, but by eleven she was tired, so I got up to use the latrine. When I came back... she was like this. Blood was gushing from her chest. I panicked and screamed for help. That’s all I know. It happened in the few minutes I was gone."
"Did you see anyone else awake? A light in a window? Someone in the hallway?" Haruko asked.
"It was dark, and I heard nothing. But... wait. Just before, I thought I saw a shadow in the room directly across from us."
"Across? But if the window was closed, how could you see?"
"Well... the lights were out over there, so I didn't notice at first. But I think someone was watching us from the darkness the whole time..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography & Title:** The title "パンパンガール殺人事件" (Pan-pan Girl Murder Case) is set in a bold, hand-drawn or stylized gothic-like font to grab attention. This is typical of *Kasutori* magazines—low-quality pulp journals popular in the immediate post-war period.
*   **Layout:** Standard vertical Japanese layout. The text is divided into thin columns to accommodate the narrow page format. 
*   **Numbering:** The "(一)" indicates this is the first chapter of a serialized story.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The author's names are placed prominently under the title. The use of furigana (reading aids) for some kanji (like 抉られている - *egurarete-iru*) suggests a broad audience, including those who might struggle with complex kanji.
*   **Sensationalism:** The text uses evocative language ("like a 16-year-old girl's breasts," "buck naked," "blood-drenched") designed to provoke both prurient interest and shock—hallmarks of the "ero-guro-nansensu" (erotic grotesque nonsense) tradition that saw a revival post-WWII.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Pan-pan Girl (パンパンガール):** A term for street prostitutes who catered primarily to the US-led Occupation forces (GHQ) after WWII. They were often war orphans or refugees with no other means of survival. The term has a somewhat "westernized" or "modern" connotation compared to traditional prostitution.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** Named after a cheap, foul-smelling dregs-based shochu, "Kasutori magazines" were cheap pulp publications that flourished between 1946 and 1952. They focused on sex, crime, and sensationalist gossip.
*   **Teigin Case (帝銀事件):** The text mentions the "Teikoku Ginko (Teigin) Poisoning Case," a real-life mass poisoning and robbery that occurred in January 1948. Referencing it helps date the story to the late 1940s and adds a "true crime" flavor to the fiction.
*   **War Victims (戦災者):** The victim is described as a war refugee from Osaka. This reflects the reality of millions of displaced Japanese people living in cramped "apartments" (often makeshift lodgings like the "Hogetsu-so" mentioned) after the firebombing of major cities.
*   **Yamiya (闇屋):** Black marketeers. In the post-war shortage, the black market was the primary source of food and goods, and "Yamiya" were common fixtures of society and pulp fiction.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **猫柳 (Nekoyanagi):** Pussy willow. Used here as a metaphor for budding sexuality/breasts.
*   **襟をかき合せ乍ら (Eri o kaki-awase nagara):** "While pulling one's collar together." A common literary trope to indicate cold weather or a sense of modest haste.
*   **過剰物資移動業 (Kajō busshi idō-gyō):** Literally "Surplus goods movement business." A euphemism for a black-market dealer (闇屋 - *yamiya*).
*   **櫻紙 (Sakuragami):** A type of coarse toilet paper or tissue commonly used at the time. Its presence near the pillows is a clear sexual euphemism.
*   **巷間 (Kōkan):** "In the streets" or "among the public."
*   **四畳半 (Yojō-han):** A four-and-a-half mat room. This was the standard size for a small, cheap single-occupancy room in post-war Japan.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Decadence:** The story explores the "underbelly" of post-war life: poverty, the black market, and sexual desperation.
*   **The "New Woman" as Detective:** Aozora Haruko is a "modern" woman—a Takarazuka singer turned detective. This reflects a shift in gender roles and the popularity of female protagonists in 1940s mystery fiction.
*   **Voyeurism:** The final hook of the passage introduces the theme of voyeurism (someone watching the couple from across the way), which heightens the "erotic-grotesque" appeal for the reader.
*   **Social Dislocation:** The victim's lack of relatives and her status as a "department store girl" (a common role for young women trying to maintain middle-class appearances while struggling) highlights the fragility of social ties in the post-war era.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction / Pulp Mystery / Ero-Guro
*   **Tags:** Murder Mystery, Post-war Japan, Prostitution (subtext), Noir, Amateur Detective, Black Market, Takarazuka, Sensationalism.
