**愛欲の歯車**
**佐々木 直**

**妹に恋人 二人を奪われたマダムはどう生きた？**

一

「マダム、電話ですよ。」
バーテンの松本が、針を含んだような声で硝子戸の外から呼ぶ。
「電話、あなた聞いていてよ……」
マダム彌生は眉根をよせて、硝子戸越しに言った。
「それが、僕では用をなさんのです。マダムでなくちゃね。」
「そうッ、ぢゃあ、ちょっと待ってもらっていて、ちょうだい」
バーテンの足音が遠ざかると、
「ふぅうん」
と彌生は鼻をならして（バーテン風情で、わたしの行状を批判するなんて滑稽至極だわ）と思いながら、食卓の向いがわに坐っている玉置へ
「しばらく待ってゝね、すぐ来ますから」
といいつつ、酔つてとろりとした眼に媚を現してみつめた。

すうつと立ちあがると、よろよろとよろける、硝子戸につかまつた彌生の着物の裾は乱れ煽情的な、色彩が、ぱつと、なまめかしい雰囲気を醸し出した。
「ねえ、待つて、ねえ……」
甘えるような声を残して、彌生は店へ出て行つた。
うすくらいシャンデリヤの光の下には、客がだてこんでいて、女給の嬌笑が、みだらな爛れた、気配をおほり立てゝいた。酔つた躰をカウンターに凭せかけて、受話器をとると、どこからか
「マダム、マダム」
と呼ぶ、彌生は店内の客へ、まんべなく、媚笑をふりまいた。
「皆さん、いらっしゃい……」
と言つてから受話器を耳へあてた。
「どなた……あゝ……いつお帰りになったの……電報？ 知らないわ……ちょっと待つてね」
電話口を平手でぴたりと押え、
「松本さん、ちょっと……」
と呼んだ。
「ご用ですか、マダム……」
「昨日、電報が来たそうですね」
「来ましたよ、これですよ」
バーテンは電報の皺をのばしながらカウンターの上にひろげた。
「どうして知らせて下さらなかった」
「昨日、これをもつて、マダムのアパートの部屋まで行つたんですが、どうも、なかの気配がね、ひどくお楽しみのようで、僕はノックする気がしなかったのです、それに電報は今日間に合えばいゝんだと言う気があつてね」
「ぢゃあ、何故、今日早く言つてくれなかつたの。」
「すみません、忘れていたのです」
と、つんとして電話口へ向つた。
「馬鹿にしているわ……」
「え、電報、着いていましたわ、店の者がうっかり忘れていたのです、すみません……あらッ、いまからこゝへ来るつて、困るわ、駄目々々、いまはとってもお店が忙しいの……ぢゃね、三十分ほど経つたら帰りますから、アパートの方へ先に行つて待つてゝ下さい……ふゝん、ふふ、念をおさなくても判つているぢゃないの……」
がちやりと受話器をおいた。
「マダムお楽しみの連続ですね……」
「なにを言つているの……」
言い捨てゝ奥へ入ると、玉置が浮かぬ顔をしてそわそわしていた。

二

アパートの自室の前に立つて、彌生ははつとして立ちどまつた、話声が聞える、かぎ穴に耳をあてたが話の内容は不明だつたが、有田が女を連れこんでいるらしい気配に、彌生は、自分の行状を反省する余裕を失つてしまつて、嫉妬にかりたてられた。
「有田さん、お帰りにたつたんですね」「いやんなつちまうわ」
「僕、帰ります……」
「そんなこと気にしなくてもいゝのよ、あなは、いつものとこで待つてゝね、有田をはぐらかせて、わたし大急ぎで、あなたのそばへ駆けつけるから……」
彌生は黒の一重羽織を着ながら言つた。

ハンドルを廻したが内から鍵がかかつていた。
「有田さん、あけてよ……」
室内の狼狽がありありと眼に見える、彌生はいらいらしながら、外で待つていた。
ドアが開くなり、騎虎の勢で飛びこんだ彌生の眼に、思い設けぬ妹の明代がそこにいた。
「あらッ、この部屋、お姉さんの……」
「明ちゃん、あなたこそ、どうしてこゝへ？」
「わたし……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Gears of Lust**
**Sasaki Nao**

**To younger sister, lover: The Madame from whom two people were stolen, how did she live?**

I

"Madame, [it is] a telephone [call]."
Matsumoto the barman, with a voice as if containing needles, calls from outside the glass door.
"The phone, you listen to it please..."
Madame Yayoi, bringing her eyebrows together, said through the glass door.
"That, for me, it won't do the business. It must be the Madame."
"Right. Well then, have them wait a little, please."
When the barman's footsteps recede,
"Hmph,"
Yayoi made a sound with her nose (A mere barman, to criticize my conduct is extremely comical) while thinking, to Tamaki who is sitting on the opposite side of the dining table:
"Wait for a while, okay? Because I will come immediately."
While saying this, with eyes turned blurry by being drunk, she gazed showing coquetry.

Rising smoothly, she tottered unsteadily. The hem of Yayoi's kimono, which caught on the glass door, was disarranged, and the inflammatory colors, suddenly, brewed an alluring atmosphere.
"Hey, wait, hey..."
Leaving a voice as if acting spoiled, Yayoi went out to the shop.
Under the light of the dim chandelier, customers were crowded, and the waitresses' coquettish laughter stirred up a lewd, festering air. Leaning her drunken body against the counter, taking the receiver, from somewhere:
"Madame, Madame,"
[they] call. Yayoi, to the customers in the shop, without exception, scattered coquettish smiles.
"Everyone, welcome..."
After saying [that], she put the receiver to her ear.
"Who [is it]... Ah... when did you return... A telegram? I don't know it... wait a moment."
Pressing the telephone mouthpiece flat with her palm,
"Mr. Matsumoto, a moment..."
[she] called.
"Is there business, Madame?"
"Yesterday, it seems a telegram came, right?"
"It came, it's this."
The barman, while smoothing the wrinkles of the telegram, spread it on the counter.
"Why didn't you let me know?"
"Yesterday, holding this, I went to Madame's apartment room, but somehow, the atmosphere inside, [you] seemed to be having great fun, so I didn't feel like knocking. Besides, there was a feeling that the telegram would be in time if [it] made it today."
"Then, why didn't you tell me early today?"
"I'm sorry, I had forgotten it,"
he said coldly and turned toward the telephone.
"He's making a fool of me..."
"Yes, the telegram, it had arrived. A person of the shop carelessly forgot it, I'm sorry... Oh, coming here from now, [that's] a problem. No, no, right now the shop is very busy... well then, since I will return after about 30 minutes pass, go to the apartment first and please wait... Hmph, fufu, even without making sure, you know, don't you..."
With a click, she put down the receiver.
"Madame, it's a continuation of having fun, isn't it..."
"What are you saying..."
Leaving [those words] and entering the back, Tamaki was fidgeting with a gloomy face.

II

Standing in front of her own room in the apartment, Yayoi stopped with a start. Speaking voices can be heard. She put her ear to the keyhole; the content of the talk was unclear, but at the sign that Arita seems to have brought a woman in, Yayoi, losing the margin to reflect on her own conduct, was driven by jealousy.
"Mr. Arita, you returned, didn't you?" "It becomes unpleasant."
"I, am going home..."
"You don't have to worry about such a thing. You, wait at the usual place, okay? Having dodged Arita, I, in a great hurry, will rush to your side, so..."
Yayoi said while wearing a black single-layer haori.

She turned the handle, but from the inside, the key was locked.
"Mr. Arita, open up..."
The confusion inside the room is clearly visible to the eye. Yayoi, while being irritated, waited outside.
As soon as the door opened, with the momentum of "riding a tiger," Yayoi who jumped in, in her eyes, her unexpected younger sister Akiyo was there.
"Oh, this room, [it's] elder sister's..."
"Aki-chan, you of all people, why are you here?"
"I..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Gears of Desire**
**By Nao Sasaki**

**Her lover stolen by her sister—how did the Madame survive the loss of both?**

I

"Madame, a phone call for you."
Matsumoto the bartender called from behind the glass door, his voice sharp and prickly, as if it held needles.
"Take a message for me, would you?" 
Madame Yayoi replied through the door, her brow furrowing in annoyance.
"I’m afraid I won’t do, Madame. They insisted on speaking to you personally."
"Ugh, fine. Tell them to hold on a moment."
As the bartender’s footsteps faded away, Yayoi let out a sharp "Hmph." *The nerve of a mere bartender, judging my behavior—it’s absolutely farcical,* she thought. She turned back to Tamaki, who sat across the table.
"Wait here a moment, darling. I’ll be right back," she said, her eyes, hazy with drink, casting a lingering, flirtatious gaze upon him.

She rose fluidly, though she swayed on her feet. As she caught herself against the glass door, the hem of her kimono fluttered into disarray. The provocative colors of the silk flashed, instantly conjuring an air of seductive abandon.
"Wait for me now..." 
Leaving that coaxing plea behind, Yayoi stepped out into the main bar.
Under the dim glow of the chandeliers, the room was packed. The high-pitched giggles of the hostesses whipped up a decadent, feverish atmosphere. Leaning her drunken weight against the counter, she picked up the receiver. From various corners of the room, voices called out, "Madame! Madame!" Yayoi scattered practiced, flirtatious smiles to every customer in the house.
"Welcome, everyone..." she purred before finally pressing the receiver to her ear.
"Who is this? Oh... when did you get back? A telegram? I don't know anything about a telegram... hold on a second."
She pressed her palm firmly over the mouthpiece.
"Matsumoto, a word."
"Yes, Madame?"
"I hear a telegram arrived yesterday."
"It did. Here it is." The bartender smoothed out the crumpled paper and spread it on the counter.
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"I actually took it to your apartment yesterday. But judging by the... noises coming from inside, you seemed to be occupied with 'festivities.' I didn't have the heart to knock. Besides, I figured it wouldn't matter as long as you got it today."
"Then why didn't you tell me first thing this morning?"
"I'm sorry. It slipped my mind," he said curtly, turning back to his work.
"He's mocking me," Yayoi hissed under her breath. 
She returned to the phone. "Yes, the telegram was here. My staff carelessly forgot to give it to me, I'm so sorry... What? You're coming here now? Oh, that’s a problem. No, no, the bar is far too busy right now. Listen, I'll be home in about thirty minutes. Why don't you go ahead to the apartment and wait for me there? ...Hehe, you don't have to keep checking, you know I'll be there."
She slammed the receiver back into its cradle.
"Madame, your 'festivities' never seem to end, do they?" Matsumoto remarked.
"Mind your own business!"
She snapped at him and retreated to the back room, where Tamaki sat, looking sullen and restless.

II

Standing before her apartment door, Yayoi froze. Voices were coming from inside. She pressed her ear to the keyhole, but the words were muffled. The realization that her lover, Arita, had brought another woman into her home hit her instantly. Completely forgetting her own indiscretions, she was consumed by a white-hot flare of jealousy.
"So, Arita, you've finally come home... This is disgusting."
Inside, a man's voice muttered, "I'm leaving..."
"Don't worry about him," Yayoi whispered to herself, or perhaps to the imaginary lover she had just left. "Wait for me at our usual spot. Once I get rid of Arita, I'll come running to you..." she muttered as she threw on a black silk haori.

She twisted the doorknob, but it was locked from the inside.
"Arita! Open this door!"
She could practically see the panic on the other side. Bristling with impatience, she waited.
The moment the door creaked open, Yayoi charged inside like a woman possessed. But the person standing there was the last person she expected: her younger sister, Akiyo.
"Oh! Sis... is this your room?"
"Aki? What on earth are you doing here?"
"I..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page uses a traditional vertical layout (*tate-gaki*), common in Japanese periodicals. The title "愛欲の歯車" (Gears of Desire/Lust) is set in a large, bold, stylized font at the top right, signaling its importance as the lead story.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the most prominent element, followed by the author's name (Sasaki Nao) and the subtitle/teaser. The illustration bridges the title and the text, providing visual flavor. The use of numbers (一, 二) indicates chapter or section breaks.
*   **Illustration:** The artwork is typical of 1950s "pulp" magazines—expressive, somewhat melodramatic, and focusing on the "Madame" character (identifiable by her mature hairstyle and kimono). The man in the background adds to the sense of a crowded, smoky nightlife setting.
*   **Decorative Borders:** The text is framed by a decorative, wavy border, which was a common stylistic choice for fiction sections in magazines of this era to distinguish them from news or advertisements.
*   **Columns:** The text is arranged in dense columns. There is a small page number "(20)" at the bottom center.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The "Madame" Culture:** In post-war Japan, a "Madame" was the female proprietress of a bar or nightclub. These women were often independent, savvy business owners who managed "waitresses" (*jokyu*) and catered to a male clientele. They occupied a unique social space: sophisticated and often seen as sexually liberated or morally complex.
*   **Post-War Urban Life:** The story mentions "apartments" (*apaato*) and "telegrams" (*denpo*). In the 1950s, living in a modern apartment building was a sign of urban middle-class or "modern boy/girl" status. Telegrams were still a primary method for urgent communication.
*   **"Kasutori" Literature:** The title and themes suggest this is part of the *kasutori* (low-budget/pulp) magazine tradition. These magazines flourished in the occupation and post-occupation era, focusing on "the three S's": Sport, Screen (movies), and Sex (erotic/romantic drama).
*   **Social Conventions:** The tension between the Madame's professional persona (flirting with customers like Tamaki) and her private life (her relationship with Arita) reflects the era's anxieties about changing gender roles and the "moral decay" of the city.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **愛欲 (Aiyoku):** Passion, lust, or carnal desire. A stronger, more visceral term than *ren'ai* (romantic love).
*   **マダム (Madamu):** Loanword for "Madame." Refers specifically to the female manager of a bar.
*   **バーテン (Baaten):** Abbreviation of "bartender." In this era, it sometimes carried a slightly dismissive nuance from the perspective of the employer.
*   **行状 (Gyōjō):** Behavior, conduct, or "doings." Often used in a slightly judgmental way here.
*   **滑稽至極 (Kokkei shigoku):** Extremely comical or ridiculous. A somewhat formal/literary four-character idiom (*yojijukugo*).
*   **煽情的 (Senjōteki):** Suggestive, inflammatory, or sensational.
*   **女給 (Jokyū):** "Waitress" or "hostess" in a cafe or bar. A term specific to the pre-war and early post-war bar scene.
*   **媚笑 (Bishō):** A coquettish or flattering smile.
*   **一重羽織 (Hitoe-baori):** An unlined formal kimono jacket, typically worn in warmer months.
*   **騎虎の勢 (Kiko no osui):** Literally "momentum of riding a tiger." An idiom meaning to be in a situation where one cannot stop or turn back; charging forward with great force.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Jealousy and Hypocrisy:** The central irony is Yayoi's intense jealousy over Arita potentially having a woman in the room, despite her own blatant flirting and "festivities" with Tamaki and other customers. This highlights the character's ego and the chaotic nature of her "gears of desire."
*   **Public vs. Private Personas:** The shift from Section I (the bar) to Section II (the apartment) illustrates the collapse of the boundary between Yayoi's professional life as a "flirty Madame" and her private domestic life.
*   **Betrayal:** The subtitle and the ending reveal a theme of familial betrayal—the "other woman" turns out to be her own sister, Akiyo. This adds a "taboo" element common in pulp fiction.
*   **Post-War Cynicism:** The bartender's needle-like comments and Yayoi's dismissiveness of him reflect a cynical, fragmented social structure where traditional respect is replaced by transactional or weary relationships.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp/Kasutori.
*   **Genre:** Melodrama, Romance, Drama.
