## 1️⃣ Original Japanese
と我れにもなく血潮を烈しく騒が
せていた。やがて淡い電氣が點くと
「もう一杯注いでくれよ」
　佐崎は何でもなかつた様に言つた
その次に電燈がやつと點つたのは
七時半である。急に話聲が騒々しく
なり、皿やカツプが陽氣な音を立て
た。電蓄が港が見える丘を唄い出し
た時、フラツと入つて来た背の高い
背廣男。
「よお、來た來た」
　佐崎が入り口へ聲をかけたより早く
詩子も、そして富子も、何故か大き
な動揺を表情に走らせていた。そし
てその男も又さつと血の氣の引いた
ような硬い顔になつていた。
「紹介しましょう、僕の竹馬の友、
西山保夫元大尉だ。この人が河原町
第一の人氣女給詩子さん、こつちは
新進のトミ子さん。どうだ、僕の言
つた通り美人揃いだろう。さあ皆變
な顔してないで、とにかく乾盃しよ
う」
　運ばれて来た四つのハイボールを
皆が取上げた時、すつかり酔つ拂つ
てはしやいでいる佐崎は氣付かなか
つたが、詩子はいつになく顔蒼ざめ
ていたし、富子もあの丸ポチヤの可
愛い顔を歪んだように引吊らせて、
盃を持つた手は微かに震えていた。
　次に電燈が消える頃には、皆もう
かなり酔つていたが――
「富子さん、あれからどうした？」
西山君の聲である。
「あれから随分貴方を探したわ。運
命の神様は何所まで悪戯が好きなん
でしよう。私がやつと京都迄来たら
貴方はもう中部三七部隊へ入れら九
た後だったの、それ以後の消息は分ら
なかつたけれど、私は屹度いつか歸
つて下さると信じて、貴方の家のす
ぐ近くにちつと下宿して待ってたの
で、會えてよかったわ、私――」
「有難う富子。俺はソ満國境に抑留
されてたのさ。もう大丈夫、今度は
もう何所へも行かないよ」
「私がこんな女になつていても？」
「境遇や職業が問題ぢやないよ」
　こうした二人の会話を聞いている
うちに、詩子は何故か突然席を立つ
た。
「何所へ行くんだ？」
「少し飲み過ぎたらしいの――」
「ぢやあもう酒はよして、詩子さん
さつきの話……どお？」
「いいわ、誰とでもお相手するわ、
今夜から少し人間が變るかも知
れないわよ」
　詩子は火の様に激しい氣性を無理
に押えて、ともすれば流れ落ちよう
とする涙を見せまいと努力していた
が、佐崎は勿論そんな事を知る筈も
なかつた。
「佐崎、何所へ行くんだ」
「詩子さんとスペシャル・ルーム
へ行くのさ。何なら君も富子さんと
は昔馴染らしいが、一緒に一時間ば
かり、楽しい時間を過したらどうだ
ね」
　昔許した戀人と衾を共にするのに
富子も嫌な筈もない。すぐに話は纏
まつたらしかつた。
　やがて四人はボツクスを立つと、
非常口から外へ出て、隘い露路傳い
に裏通りへ出た。呼鈴の合圖で此家
と背中合せの家の裏木戸が開き、す
ぐ出て来た婆さんが、一本の蠟燭を
頼りに、その鐵梯子を上つて四人
を二階へ案内していつた。
「詩子さん、珍らしくお客様ですか
もうすぐ電燈が點くでしようけど、
それまでローソクで辛抱して下さい
ね」
　雇賃の婆はそう言いながら、二組
の男女を隣り合せの二つの座敷へ案
内した。
　四疊半の小間に茶箪笥が一つつ、そ
の上に茶器が盆にのつて、二羽の折
鶴が仲よく並んでいた。床には墨繪
の軸と活花の水盆。他に何の装飾も
ない室だが、三つに折られた寝具が
若い二人の胸を妖しく騒がせた。ゆ
らゆら揺れる灯影の下で――
「本当に詩子さんが僕と寝てくれる
なんて夢みたいだよ。魔がささない
うちに早速床へ入ろう。詩子さん帯
を解けよ」
　狂うような情炎を佐崎はそんな言
葉にして、すぐに洋服を脱ぐと、詩
子が着せかける寝衣に、身体を包ん
で、もう蒲團の中へもぐり込んでい
た。詩子も仕方なさそうにキユツキ
ユツと帯を解いた。向うむきになつ
て脱いだ着物の下から、情慾を射る
ような緋模様の長襦袢が現れた。彼
女は何度もせき立てられて、やつと
床へ入つて来ると、待ちかねていた
ように佐崎は、彼女の手を握つてき
た。
「嫌……くすぐつたい！」
「ねえ詩子さん、一寸君の素肌を拜
ませてくれないかなア」
　彼女がまだ、嫌も應も言わない間
に、彼はもう上蒲團をはね上げてい
た。蠟燭の幽光に浮彫になつた彼女
の肉体の美しさ。うなじから胸元に
盛上つて來る豊醇な双曲線、白くな
だらかなはち切れそうな下腹、神秘
の聖泉を包む濃い若草の丘、むつち
りしたカーヴを見事に生かしている
二つの太腿――それらはあまりにも
濃艶な、あまりにも妖美な姿だつた
「羞しいから、そんなに見詰めない
で……」
　男にはずれても戀にはすれぬ、ま
だこうした事に慣れない初々しい態
度は、佐崎の肉慾を一層激しく擽つ
た。思わず顔を蔽つてしまう詩子は
酔つて唄つて男を鼻で扱う時の彼女
とは、全く別人のようにいらぶしく
見えた。
　彼女が羞しそうに彼の視線を拒も
うとした時、偶然丁度電燈が點いて
羞しい肉体は燦々たる光線の中に露
出してしまつた。
「あら、嫌アーン！」
　と鼻聲で吃驚して飛起きて、襦袢
の前を押えている彼女は、まるで十
六娘が行水を覗かれた時のような、
水々しいゼスチュアに活きていた。
「電燈消して工、うちこんな明るい
のん嫌ワ」

　運ばれて来た四つのハイボールを皆が取り上げた時、すっかり酔っ払ってはしゃいでいる佐崎は気付かなかったが、詩子はいつになく顔蒼ざめていたし、富子もあの丸ぽちゃの可愛い顔を歪んだように引きつらせて、杯を持った手は微かに震えていた。
　次に電灯が消える頃には、皆もうかなり酔っていたが――
「富子さん、あれからどうした？」
西山君の声である。
「あれから随分あなたを探したわ。運命の神様は何所まで悪戯が好きなんでしょう。私がやっと京都まで来たら、あなたはもう中部三七部隊へ入れられた後だったの。それ以後の消息は分からなかったけれど、私はきっといつか帰って下さると信じて、あなたの家のすぐ近くにちょっと下宿して待ってたので、会えてよかったわ、私――」
「ありがとう富子。俺はソ満国境に抑留されてたのさ。もう大丈夫、今度はもうどこへも行かないよ」
「私がこんな女になっていても？」
「境遇や職業が問題じゃないよ」
　こうした二人の会話を聞いているうちに、詩子は何故か突然席を立った。
「どこへ行くんだ？」
「少し飲み過ぎたらしいの――」
「じゃあもう酒はよして、詩子さんさっきの話……どう？」
「いいわ、誰とでもお相手するわ、今夜から少し人間が変わるかもしれないわよ」

「佐崎、どこへ行くんだ」
「詩子さんとスペシャル・ルームへ行くのさ。何なら君も富子さんとは昔馴染みらしいが、一緒に一時間ばかり、楽しい時間を過ごしたらどうだね」
　昔許した恋人と衾（ふすま）を共にするのに富子も嫌なはずもない。すぐに話はまとまったらしかった。
　やがて四人はボックスを立つと、非常口から外へ出て、狭い路地伝いに裏通りへ出た。呼鈴の合図でこの家と背中合わせの家の裏木戸が開き、すぐ出て来たお婆さんが、一本の蝋燭（ろうそく）を頼りに、その鉄梯子を上って四人を二階へ案内していった。

「嫌……くすぐったい！」
「ねえ詩子さん、ちょっと君の素肌を拝ませてくれないかなあ」
　彼女がまだ、嫌も応も言わない間に、彼はもう上布団をはね上げていた。蝋燭の幽光に浮き彫りになった彼女の肉体の美しさ。うなじから胸元に盛り上がって来る豊醇な双曲線、白くなだらかなはち切れそうな下腹、神秘の聖泉を包む濃い若草の丘、むっちりしたカーブを見事に生かしている二つの太腿――それらはあまりにも濃艶な、あまりにも妖美な姿だった。
「恥ずかしいから、そんなに見つめないで……」
　男には慣れても恋には慣れぬ、まだこうした事に慣れない初々しい態度は、佐崎の肉欲を一層激しくくすぐった。思わず顔を覆ってしまう詩子は、酔って唄って男を鼻であしらう時の彼女とは、全く別人のように愛らしく見えた。
　彼女が恥ずかしそうに彼の視線を拒もうとした時、偶然ちょうど電灯が点いて、恥ずかしい肉体は燦々たる光線の中に露出してしまった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
(And) unlike myself, [my] blood was violently stirred. Soon, when a faint light came on:
"Pour me another cup."
Sazaki said as if nothing had happened. The next time the electric light finally turned on was 7:30. Suddenly voices became noisy, plates and cups made cheerful sounds. When the phonograph started singing "The Hill Where You Can See the Harbor," a tall man in a suit wandered in.
"Yo, look who's here."
Faster than Sazaki could call to the entrance, Utako and also Tomiko, for some reason, let a great agitation run across their expressions. And that man also became a hard face as if the blood had drained away.
"Let me introduce him, my childhood friend, former Captain Yasuo Nishiyama. This person is Kawaramachi’s number one popular waitress Utako-san, and this is the rising star Tomiko-san. How about it, just as I said, they are a pair of beauties. Come on, don't everyone have strange faces, anyway let’s toast."
When everyone picked up the four highballs that were carried over, Sazaki, who was completely drunk and frolicking, did not notice, but Utako’s face was pale as never before, and Tomiko’s cute round face was distorted as if twitching, and the hand holding the cup was slightly trembling.
Next, around the time the light turned off, everyone was already quite drunk, but—
"Tomiko-san, what happened after that?"
It was Nishiyama-kun's voice.
"I looked for you a lot after that. I wonder how far the god of fate likes to play tricks. When I finally came to Kyoto, you had already been put into the Central 37th Unit. After that, news was unknown, but I believed you would surely return someday, and stayed in a lodging right near your house waiting, so I'm glad I met you, I—"
"Thanks, Tomiko. I was detained on the Soviet-Manchurian border. It's okay now, this time I won't go anywhere else."
"Even if I have become this kind of woman?"
"Circumstances and occupation are not a problem."
While listening to these two's conversation, for some reason Utako suddenly stood up from her seat.
"Where are you going?"
"I think I drank a bit too much—"
"Then stop drinking, Utako-san, about the talk from before... how about it?"
"Fine, I'll be a partner for anyone. From tonight, maybe I'll become a bit of a different person."
Utako was forcibly suppressing a temper as fierce as fire, making an effort not to show tears that were about to fall, but Sazaki of course had no way of knowing such a thing.
"Sazaki, where are you going?"
"Going to the 'Special Room' with Utako-san. If you like, since it seems you and Tomiko-san are old acquaintances, why don't you spend about an hour of fun time together."
To share a bed with a former lover she once permitted, Tomiko could not have been unwilling. The talk seemed to be settled immediately.
Before long, the four stood up from the booth, went out through the emergency exit, and followed a narrow alley to a back street. At the signal of a bell, the back gate of the house back-to-back with this one opened, and an old woman who came out immediately, relying on a single candle, climbed the iron ladder and guided the four to the second floor.
"Utako-san, a guest, how rare. The electric light will probably come on soon, but please endure with a candle until then."
While saying so, the hired old woman guided the two pairs of men and women to two adjacent tatami rooms.
In the small four-and-a-half mat room, there was one tea cabinet, and on top of it tea sets were on a tray, with two paper cranes lined up closely. On the alcove, an ink-wash painting scroll and a flower basin. There were no other decorations in the room, but the bedding folded in three caused the two young people's chests to stir strangely. Under the flickering lamplight—
"Really, for Utako-san to sleep with me, it feels like a dream. Before a demon interferes, let's get into bed immediately. Utako-san, undo your sash."
Sazaki put his crazed passion into such words, and immediately took off his suit, wrapped his body in the nightwear Utako put on him, and already crawled into the futon. Utako also, as if having no choice, undid her sash with a 'kyu-kyu' sound. From under the kimono she took off while facing away, a long undergarment with a scarlet pattern that seemed to shoot through lust appeared. Being rushed many times, she finally entered the bed, and as if he couldn't wait, Sazaki grabbed her hand.
"No... it tickles!"
"Hey, Utako-san, let me worship your bare skin for a moment."
While she had not yet said yes or no, he had already thrown back the upper quilt. The beauty of her body carved out by the faint light of the candle. The rich double curves rising from the nape to the chest, the white smooth abdomen seemingly about to burst, the hill of deep young grass surrounding the mysterious sacred spring, the two thighs perfectly bringing to life the plump curves—those were a figure too voluptuous, too bewitchingly beautiful.
"It's embarrassing, so don't stare so much..."
Though jaded by men, she was not jaded by love; her innocent attitude of not being used to such things yet tickled Sazaki's lust even more. Utako, who inadvertently covered her face, looked like a completely different person, lovely, compared to when she was drunk and singing and treating men like nothing.
When she bashfully tried to refuse his gaze, by chance, just then the electric light came on, and her embarrassing body was exposed in the brilliant light.
"Oh, no—!"
And jumping up in surprise with a nasal voice, holding the front of her undergarment, she lived in a fresh gesture, just like a sixteen-year-old girl who was peeked at while bathing.
"Turn off the light, I hate it being this bright."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
My blood was racing with an intensity I didn't recognize in myself. When a dim light finally flickered on, Sazaki spoke as if nothing were amiss. "Pour me another, will you?"

It was 7:30 by the time the electricity was restored for good. Suddenly, the room erupted with the din of voices and the cheerful clatter of plates and cups. Just as the phonograph began to croon *The Hill Where You Can See the Harbor*, a tall man in a suit drifted into the room.

"Hey, there he is!" Sazaki called out.

Even before Sazaki greeted him, both Utako and Tomiko were visibly shaken. The man, too, turned pale, his expression hardening instantly.

"Let me introduce you," Sazaki continued. "This is my old childhood friend, former Captain Yasuo Nishiyama. And over here we have Utako-san, the most popular girl in Kawaramachi, and the rising star, Tomiko-san. Quite the pair of beauties, wouldn't you say? Come now, don't look so grim. Let's have a toast."

As they raised their highballs, the boisterous Sazaki—already quite drunk—failed to notice that Utako was uncharacteristically pale. Tomiko’s cute, round face was contorted with a visible tremor, and her hand shook as she held her glass.

By the time the lights flickered off again, the group was thoroughly intoxicated.

"Tomiko," Nishiyama’s voice broke the air, "what happened to you after that?"

"I searched for you everywhere," she replied. "I wonder how long the gods of fate intend to toy with us. By the time I finally reached Kyoto, you had already been shipped off to the 37th Central Unit. I heard nothing after that, but I believed with all my heart you’d return. I even took a room near your old house just to wait for you. I’m so glad I found you, I—"

"Thank you, Tomiko. I was held in a Soviet camp on the border. But it's alright now. I’m not going anywhere ever again."

"Even though I’ve become... a woman like this?"

"Your circumstances, your job—none of that matters to me."

Listening to their exchange, Utako suddenly stood up. "Where are you going?" Sazaki asked.

"I think I’ve had a bit too much to drink..."

"Then forget the booze. What about what we were talking about earlier? Well?"

"Fine," Utako snapped. "I’ll go with anyone. Maybe I’ll be a different person starting tonight."

She was fighting to suppress a temper as fierce as fire, struggling to hide the tears that threatened to fall. Sazaki, naturally, was oblivious.

"Sazaki, where are you off to?" Nishiyama asked.

"Utako and I are heading to a 'special room.' Since it seems you and Tomiko are old flames, why don't the two of you spend an hour or so together? Have some fun."

Tomiko was more than willing to share a bed with the lover she had once given herself to. The matter was settled in an instant.

The four of them left their booth and slipped out an emergency exit, following a narrow alley to a back street. At the signal of a bell, a gate opened. An old woman appeared with a single candle and led them up an iron ladder to the second floor.

"A guest for Utako-san? How rare," the old woman remarked. "The lights should be on soon, but you'll have to make do with the candle for now."

She led the two couples into adjacent rooms. The small four-and-a-half mat room contained nothing but a tea cabinet with two paper cranes on top, an ink-wash scroll, and a flower basin. It was a sparse room, but the sight of the bedding folded into three sent a thrill of lust through the young couple's hearts. In the flickering candlelight, Sazaki spoke with a desperate passion.

"I can't believe you're actually sleeping with me. It’s like a dream. Let's get to bed before the moment passes. Utako, take off your sash."

Sazaki stripped off his suit and wrapped himself in the robe Utako offered before diving into the futon. Utako, resigned, undid her sash. As she turned away to disrobe, a flash of her scarlet-patterned undergarment—a sight that pierced Sazaki's desire—came into view. After much prodding, she finally joined him in bed, and Sazaki immediately grabbed her hand.

"No... that tickles!"

"Come on, Utako. Let me see you properly."

Before she could protest, he threw back the quilt. In the faint candlelight, her body was revealed in all its beauty—the rich curves of her neck and chest, the smooth white line of her belly, and the soft mound of hair, her thighs perfectly shaped. She was a vision of bewitching sensuality.

"I’m embarrassed... don't stare at me like that."

Though she was jaded by men, she was not jaded by love. Her innocent, bashful reaction only fueled Sazaki’s lust. Covering her face, she seemed like a different person entirely from the girl who sang and toyed with men when she was drunk.

Just as she bashfully tried to shield herself from his gaze, the electric lights suddenly flared to life, exposing her naked form in the brilliant glare.

"Oh! No!" she cried out, leaping up and clutching her garment closed. In that moment, she looked as fresh and startled as a sixteen-year-old girl caught bathing.

"Turn off the light! I hate it being this bright!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Format & Layout:** This is a standard magazine or paperback novel layout from the mid-20th century. The text is arranged in vertical columns (three columns per page).
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho (serif) typeface. Note the use of **furigana** (small kana next to kanji) for difficult words like 衾 (*fusuma* / bedding) or 隘い (*semai* / narrow).
*   **Character Sizing:** The main text is relatively small, suggesting an adult audience.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "33" is centered at the bottom. The text is dense with minimal white space, typical of affordable "pulp" publications.
*   **Orthography:** The text uses a mix of pre-reform and post-reform conventions. For example, it uses the large "tsu" (つ) where modern Japanese would use the small "tsu" (っ) in many instances (though some small 'tsu' appear to be present, the typesetting is inconsistent). It uses characters like 點 (point/turn on) and 氣 (spirit/air), which were later simplified to 点 and 気.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era (Post-WWII/Occupation):** The mention of a "Former Captain" (元大尉) and being "detained on the Soviet-Manchurian border" (ソ満国境に抑留) places this firmly in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Many Japanese soldiers were held in Siberian/Soviet labor camps after the war.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term *Kasutori* refers to a type of cheap, high-alcohol shochu and, by extension, the "pulp" magazines of the era. These stories often featured themes of romance, the "pan-pan" girls (prostitutes or bar hostesses), and the struggles of returning soldiers.
*   **Special Room (スペシャル・ルーム):** This refers to private rooms in bars or inns used for sexual encounters, common in the "red-line" or "blue-line" districts of the era.
*   **Waitresses (女給 - Jokyū):** In the pre-war and early post-war eras, "waitresses" in cafes and bars were essentially hostesses who often provided sexual services, or at least provided intimate companionship.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **竹馬の友 (Chikuba no tomo):** Literally "bamboo horse friend," meaning a childhood or "bosom" friend.
*   **ハイボール (Highball):** Highballs (whisky and soda) were a popular Western-style drink in post-war bars.
*   **衾 (Fusuma):** An archaic/literary term for bedding or quilts, often used in romantic contexts ("sharing a bed").
*   **抑留 (Yokuryū):** Internment or detention; specifically referring to the Siberian internment of Japanese POWs.
*   **長襦袢 (Nagajuban):** A long under-kimono. The "scarlet pattern" (緋模様) suggests a provocative or professional aesthetic (common for hostesses).
*   **十六娘 (Jūroku-musume):** A "sixteen-year-old girl," used here as a metaphor for youthful innocence and bashfulness.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **War Trauma and Reunion:** The subtext of the conversation between Nishiyama and Tomiko involves the trauma of war—separation, internment, and the loss of social status. Tomiko asks if he still wants her "even if I have become this kind of woman," referring to her work as a hostess/waitress, which was seen as fallen status.
*   **Contrast between Innocence and Experience:** Utako is described as a "number one waitress" who is usually cynical and treats men like toys. However, in the private room, she reverts to a "bashful sixteen-year-old," suggesting a hidden purity or a distinction between her professional persona and her true self.
*   **Eroticism (Sensualism):** The detailed description of the female body (the "rich curves," "white belly," etc.) is typical of the *fūzoku* (customs/morals) novels of the time, which pushed the boundaries of eroticism allowed in print.
*   **Fate:** The characters express a sense of being toyed with by the "God of Fate," a common sentiment in post-war Japan when lives were upended by forces beyond individual control.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Popular Novel / Pulp Fiction)
*   **Tags:** Romance, Erotica (soft), Post-war Japan, Military Veteran, Social Drama, Melodrama, Showa Era, Kasutori Culture.
