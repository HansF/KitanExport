**[Main Text]**
女を見ると、俺の子だ、艶子は俺を愛しているから疑われるのを辛がつている。世間に八月子は多いし育つものだ。と思つてしまつた。
十日程して彼女が退院する時、卯一郎は自分で子供を抱いた。軽いフニャとした動物が、まだ目も見えぬくせに、春の光りが眩（まぶ）いのか、眉をこころもちよせて目を半開きにしている。可愛いと思う、これはやつぱり俺の子だ。寄りそつて歩く艶子は、薄化粧で黒地に大きい花模様のお召をさりげなく着こなして、つましく見える、卯一郎はすつかり楽しくなつていた。
妻の菊花は三月遅れて女の児を産んだ。
卯一郎は呼ばれて歸つて来たが、二三日いると、商賣が氣にかかると大阪にいつてしまつた。
卯一郎は二人の女から責められるのがさに、どつちの子も自分の籍に入れなかつた。
卯一郎の大阪の店には、子供を抱いた艶子がいつも彼によりそつていた。子供に手がかゝるのだらうか、素顔の時が多かつた。化粧をせぬ彼女の肌は蒼ざめた荒肌で、五つ位老けて見えたおむつの洗濯をしている時、乱れた髪の頂に、五円玉位のはげが顔を出してて、彼女の過去を教えている。夜になると膝から上のつんつるのシュミー一枚で往来を歩いた。
普段にでも、駒よりのお召を粋に着こなして、髪もその時の流行に型よく結つて彼女に禿のある事など知る人はなかつたのに、子を産めば女はこうも変るものか。
風呂で見かける裸体も、筋ばつた、肉付の乏しい青白い肌で、乳房も聳弱に垂れていた。
（四）
終戰後のインフレに、ヤミで稼ぎ、筍生活のサラリーマンから、足許をつけこんで、捨て値で買つた衣類を田舎に賣りつけぼろい儲けをしていた彼も近頃はさつぱりで、妻へは金を送る事もしなくなつた。
菊花は子供を背負つて、艶子の親の家へ、卯一郎を、私の處に帰してくれる様に、としば〜頼みに行つたけれど、彼は滅多に歸つて来てくれなかつた。
そのうち菊花の子は一年程して死んだ。その時は流石に彼も帰つたけれど父にも看護されず死んだ吾が子の不びんに、彼女は卯一郎の冷たさを深く恨んだ。
子供を生んでからの菊花は、今までよりずっと健康で、急に女らしい魅力に溢れた体付になつて来た。子を産んだ爲、新陳代謝がよくなつて、彼女の体内にどどおつていた、あらゆる病源を押し出してしまつたのだろう。見違える程血色のよい顔で、卯一郎は不思議に思つた。昔の菊花でない別の女が自分を慕つている様だ。
或日、一日中艶子は店に姿をみせなかつた、何時もなら、住家と店とは近いのでよく子供を連れてやつて来て、食事の仕度をする頃に帰つて、彼の帰りを家で待つていてくれたのに、その日は食事の仕度もしてなく、いつまで待つても帰つて来なかつた。
艶子の親元へ行つてみると、子供が一人で遊んでいる。
何か胸に嫌な物がこりかたまつている様な、嫌な氣持になつて家へ帰つてそこらを見廻してみると、外出用の履物はないし、着物はと見て見ると、あつ――これは、タンスの中は殆ど空つぽであつた。
流石に肝を冷やして、下のおばあさんに尋ねて見たが、うす馬鹿の彼女は、「朝出ていきはりましたで」というだけで何も知らない。
お湯から帰つて来た、おかみさんに、「うちのはどこへ行きました。」と聞くと、

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Main Text]**
When looking at the woman: "It is my child." Because Tsuyako loves me, being suspected is painful for her. In the world, "eight-month babies" are many, and they grow up. So I ended up thinking.
About ten days later, when she was discharged from the hospital, Uichirō held the child himself. A light, squishy animal, despite not being able to see yet, perhaps the spring light was dazzling, it knit its brows slightly and kept its eyes half-open. "Cute," he thinks, this is definitely my child. Walking close beside him, Tsuyako, with light makeup, wore a black-base large flower pattern *omeshi* (silk) casually, looking frugal. Uichirō had become completely happy.
The wife, Kikuka, three months late, gave birth to a girl.
Uichirō was called and returned, but after being there two or three days, saying "business is on my mind," he went to Osaka.
Because Uichirō hated being blamed by two women, he did not enter either child into his family register.
At Uichirō's Osaka shop, Tsuyako, holding the child, was always close to him. Was it because the child took effort? There were many times she had a bare face. Her skin without makeup was a pale, rough skin, looking about five years older. While washing diapers, at the top of her disheveled hair, a bald spot about the size of a five-yen coin showed its face, telling of her past. When night came, she walked the streets in just one thin chemise that ended above the knees.
Even in daily life, she used to wear *komayori omeshi* stylishly, and her hair was tied well in the fashion of the time; no one knew she had a bald spot, but when a woman bears a child, does she change this much?
The naked body seen in the bath, too, was sinewy, pale skin lacking flesh, and breasts hung weakly.
(4)
In the post-war inflation, earning through the black market, from "bamboo shoot life" salarymen, taking advantage of their situation, he bought clothes at throwaway prices and sold them in the countryside for huge profits, but lately business was nothing, and he stopped sending money to his wife.
Kikuka, carrying the child on her back, went to Tsuyako’s parents' house often to ask, "Please let Uichirō return to my place," but he rarely returned for her.
Meanwhile, Kikuka's child died after about a year. At that time, as expected, he returned, but at the misery of the child who died without being nursed by its father, she deeply resented Uichirō’s coldness.
Kikuka, after giving birth, was much healthier than before, and her body became full of sudden womanly charm. Because she gave birth, her metabolism improved, and perhaps all the sources of illness that had been stagnant in her body were pushed out. With a complexion so good he hardly recognized her, Uichirō thought it strange. It was as if a different woman, not the old Kikuka, was yearning for him.
One day, all day, Tsuyako did not show her face at the shop. Usually, since the residence and shop were close, she often came bringing the child, and returned around the time to prepare meals, waiting at home for his return, but that day she hadn't even prepared the meal, and no matter how long he waited, she didn't return.
When he went to Tsuyako's parents' place, the child was playing alone.
With a feeling like something unpleasant was hardening in his chest, he felt bad and returned home to look around; her going-out footwear was gone, and looking at her kimonos—ah! This... the inside of the chest of drawers was almost empty.
Naturally, his blood ran cold, and he asked the old lady downstairs, but she, being a bit simple-minded, only said, "She went out this morning," and knew nothing.
To the landlady who returned from the bath, he asked, "Where did my wife go?" and...

**Star Anecdotes: Nude Photos**
In "Love of an Idiot," speaking with her voluptuous body and radiating eroticism, she sold herself as the post-war's first "Body Star," and now again in "Rashomon," Machiko Kyō makes fans groan with passionate scenes with Toshiro Mifune.
A certain director was completely smitten by this. Not satisfied with a simple crush, he thought of a "brilliant plan" to somehow see her naked body.
It was to create a script with a scene even more intense than the bath scene in "Love of an Idiot" and make her perform it.
Well, finally, the filming. Machiko Kyō, completely naked, immersed her plump body in a bath filled with real hot water.
However, as it happened, the camera's film unfortunately ran out, and it had to be replaced with a new one.
During that time, the water grew hotter and hotter. Finally unable to bear it, she jumped out of the bath. At that moment, the crank finally turned.
In this way, about ten frames of Machiko Kyō's naked body were clearly captured on film.

**The Main Story: A Tale of Two Women**
Whenever Uichirō looked at the child, he told himself, "He’s mine." He believed Tsuyako's apparent distress at his suspicion was merely proof of her love. He convinced himself that "eight-month babies" were common enough and usually survived. 
When she was discharged ten days later, Uichirō held the infant himself. The tiny, squirming creature, though still blind to the world, seemed to knit its brows against the dazzling spring sun, eyes half-open. "He's cute," Uichirō thought, feeling a surge of paternal certainty. Beside him, Tsuyako looked the picture of modesty, wearing a black silk *omeshi* kimono with a bold floral print, her makeup applied with a light, tasteful touch. In that moment, Uichirō was genuinely happy.
Three months later, his legal wife, Kikuka, gave birth to a daughter. Uichirō returned home briefly, but after only two or three days, he fled back to Osaka, claiming business demands. Hating the pressure of being caught between two women, he neglected to enter either child into his official family registry.

In Osaka, Tsuyako was always by his side at the shop, child in arms. Perhaps the toll of motherhood was too great; she rarely wore makeup now. Her skin had grown sallow and rough, making her look five years older than her age. Once, while she was washing diapers, Uichirō noticed a bald spot the size of a coin at the crown of her head—a lingering scar from a troubled past she had tried to hide. At night, she would wander the streets in nothing but a short, translucent chemise. He marveled at how much a woman could change after childbirth; she had once been so stylish, her hair always perfectly coiffed to hide her flaws. Now, even her body in the bath seemed different—sinewy, pale, and withered.

(4)
Uichirō had once thrived during the post-war inflation, profiting from the "bamboo shoot life" of desperate city dwellers by selling them cheap countryside clothes at a premium. But lately, his luck had dried up, and he stopped sending money to Kikuka. 
Kikuka would carry their child to Tsuyako’s parents’ house, begging them to send Uichirō back to her, but he rarely came. Eventually, their daughter died. Though Uichirō returned for the funeral, Kikuka could not forgive his coldness toward a child he had never bothered to nurture. 
Strangely, motherhood seemed to have transformed Kikuka into a more vibrant, healthy woman. It was as if the birth had purged her of old ailments, leaving her radiant. Uichirō found himself drawn to this "new" version of his wife.

One day, Tsuyako vanished from the shop. Usually, she would bring the child over and then head home to prepare dinner. But that evening, the house was cold and empty. He checked her parents’ house and found the child playing alone. A heavy dread settled in his chest. Back at home, he searched the rooms. Her outdoor sandals were gone. He flung open the dresser—it was empty. 
Panic-stricken, he asked the elderly neighbor downstairs, but the woman only dithered, saying she'd seen her leave that morning. Finally, he cornered the landlady returning from the bath. "Where did my wife go?" he demanded...

**Sidebar: Star Gossip - The Accidental Nude**
Machiko Kyō, the "Body Star" who rose to fame through her raw eroticism in *Love of an Idiot* and her sizzling chemistry with Toshiro Mifune in *Rashomon*, has a certain director quite obsessed. Desperate to see her unclothed, he devised a "brilliant" plan: he wrote a bath scene into a script that was even more daring than her previous roles. 
On the day of the shoot, Kyō climbed into a tub of real hot water, completely nude. But just as they began, the camera ran out of film. As the crew scrambled to reload, the water temperature continued to climb. Unable to stand the heat a second longer, Kyō leaped out of the tub. It was at that exact moment the camera started rolling. And so, ten clear frames of the naked star were immortalized on film by pure accident.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page uses a standard vertical layout common in Japanese magazines. The main story is organized into numbered sections (this being section 4). The use of *furigana* (reading aids) is sparse but present for difficult kanji like 眩 (mabui/dazzling).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The headline for the sidebar "Star Ibun" (Star Anecdotes) is set apart with wavy decorative borders, creating a clear distinction between the "literary" fiction/reportage and the "gossip" content.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style typical of mid-century printing. Some characters show slight wear or ink bleeding, characteristic of cheap "kasutori" paper.
*   **Column Structure:** The main text flows from right to left in long vertical columns, while the sidebar is boxed off on the right-hand side to catch the reader's eye first.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Japan, ca. 1950):** The text mentions "post-war inflation" and "yami" (black markets), placing the story firmly in the late 1940s or early 1950s.
*   **"Takenoko Seikatsu" (Bamboo Shoot Life):** This term refers to the desperate post-war period when urbanites had to sell their belongings (layers of clothing, like peeling a bamboo shoot) to farmers in exchange for food.
*   **Machiko Kyō & "Nikutai" Stars:** Machiko Kyō was a legendary actress. The term "Nikutai Star" (Body Star) was used in the post-war era to describe actresses who portrayed a more liberated, physical, and often eroticized version of femininity, contrasting with the "purity" expected during the war.
*   **The Films:** *Chijin no Ai* (Love of an Idiot, based on Tanizaki's novel) was released in 1949, and *Rashomon* (directed by Kurosawa) in 1950. This dates the magazine to late 1950 or 1951.
*   **Family Register (Koseki):** The mention of Uichirō not putting the children in his register highlights the social instability of the time. Children born "out of wedlock" or in complicated secondary relationships often lacked legal standing.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **八月子 (Hachigatsu-ko):** Literally "eight-month child." A term for a premature baby. In this context, it implies Uichirō suspects the child might not be his (suggesting Tsuyako was pregnant before they were together), but he convinces himself otherwise.
*   **お召 (Omeshi):** A high-quality pre-dyed silk fabric used for kimonos. Wearing this "casually" suggests a certain level of past vanity or class.
*   **つんつる (Tsuntsuru):** An onomatopoeic expression here suggesting something very short or smooth/slippery (referring to the short chemise).
*   **シュミー (Shumī):** A loanword from the French "chemise." A common piece of western-style undergarment that became popular in the early 20th century.
*   **クランク (Kuranku):** "Crank." Referring to the hand-cranked or motorized mechanism of a film camera.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Decay of Beauty:** The text focuses heavily on the physical deterioration of Tsuyako after childbirth (baldness, rough skin, sagging breasts). This reflects a common naturalistic (and often misogynistic) trope in post-war literature regarding the "exhaustion" of women.
*   **Contrast of Women:** There is a clear "Madonna/Whore" or "Wife/Mistress" dichotomy. The legal wife, Kikuka, becomes healthier and more beautiful after birth, while the mistress, Tsuyako, withers. This might be a moralistic subtext suggesting the "rightful" wife flourishes while the "extralegal" relationship leads to ruin.
*   **Male Irresponsibility:** Uichirō is portrayed as a classic "dame-mens" (useless man). He profits from others' misery, abandons his legal family, and fails to provide legal status to his children.
*   **The "Gaze":** Both the story and the sidebar are obsessed with the "naked body" (裸体). In the fiction, it is used to show decline; in the sidebar, it is used for titillation and celebrity gossip.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Serial Novel), Celebrity Gossip/Anecdote.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war poverty, Infidelity, Motherhood, Cinema history, Scandal, Eroticism, Social realism.
*   **Classification:** Kasutori Magazine (Pulp fiction).
