第２話
マダム☆スカンク

一

私は、その二階の明け放たれた窓へ性来の大音を投げつけた。
「おい！　ハマノ、居るかい」
直ぐにニヤけたリーゼント・ヤーのノッペリとした顔が覗くと、それがハマノだった。
「よッ、ガンテツのオッサンか。あがれよ。」
「いやだ！　この暑いのに、窮ん中にツッ込んどる法があるか！」
私は叱るように怒鳴りあげた。
途端に、下の格子戸がガラリと開いて、此の家のマダムのお鹿、バケツをさげて現われた。とつさの事で私は少しドギマギして会釈した。
マダムはニコ〜しながら私の方を見て、直ぐ傍の共同水道の前に踊んだ。二十七八にはなるが、顔のまるまると色白の肌で、太い眉がやゝ気になるが、鼻大きく鼻筋通り、日光尋常、肥り肉の方で踊んだ、裾前から、荒巻の鮭の身のような健康な内股を見せている。
彼女はバケツの中の茶碗や小皿を丹念に洗っているのだ。時折、私の方をチラッと見上げる目付が、馬鹿に色っぽい。私はマダムの内股から広い腰へ目をそらした。
「相不変ガンテツ主義だな。外を歩けやア向暑いんだよ。」
ハマノが派手な色のアロハを引かけて出て来た。
彼はマダムの方を見向きもせずに、私と並んで歩き出した。私は少し悪いと思ったので、マダムの方へ振り返ると彼女の方からぺこりと頭をさげた。
私達は扇町公園へ出た。此の附近唯一の樹林地帯で浮浪者やパンパンの休息所でもあるのだ。畳間の暑熱を避けるには、こうした樹林地帯の芝生の上に寝ころんで、渡ってくる天然の風に吹かれる事が一番涼しいのである。
「時に、ガンテツ。用は何だ？」
「いや、何、大した用ぢやないんだが……三木は仕事だろ？」
「うむ。」
「実は先達て、チラと拝見した三木の妹だな。あの人を、こちらから云うのもおこがましいが、自分の弟の嫁に欲しいのだが。もはや国へ帰つたのだろうね。」
「いや、まだ居る。おそらく国へ帰らないかも知れん。婆も喰いついて残つておるし、大変だよ。」
「そりゃあ好都合だ。」
「君にや好都合か知らんが、僕は溜まったもんぢゃない。何せ、六帖と四帖半のふたま。三木は三木で勝手な事に、妹を自分の間に置いて、婆を僕の部屋へ寄越しやがるんだ。尤も奴の部屋ア商売がら、道具で一杯なんで、実質上は、四畳半でも僕の部屋の方が広いとゆう、変則的な事になつてるのだからしかたがない。僕は毎晩婆の糞糞臭い寝息を嗅がされて往生しているんだ。それなのに、下のお鹿さんが族いらやつて、三木の妹とどうとかしてるとでも思うのか、下へ来て寝ろつてゆうんだが。いつそ、社長の家の玄関番にでもお願いしようかと、考えているんだ」
「あの、マダムの亭主は失礼だが、あの、下の六帖に、臥込んだ切りの御主人はどうした？　居ないのかね？」
「岡山の兄貴が連れて帰つたよ。兄貴はお鹿さんを好かないんだ。お鹿さんも兄貴一家を好かないんで、死んでも岡山へは行かないと断言している。お鹿（こゝからハマノはマダムを呼称にする）の亭主は、腹膜炎でもう到底駄目なんだ。彼が死ねば先代からの預かり物の遺産を当然お鹿へ渡さなければならぬ、長男がまだ七才だからね。それが厭さに亭主の兄貴は、その七才の長男を連れて行つちまつたんだ。勿論、籍も抜くだろう。お鹿にしてみりゃ厄介払いしたようにセイ／＼した顔をしているが、なるほど、女つて、魔物ツて感じがするね。五ツになる女の子は、お鹿の姉の嫁ぎ先が淀川にあるので、そこへ養女に貰われていつた。末の男の子はまだ乳がいるので、家にある。考えてみりゃ、お鹿一家の生活費てみりゃ、お鹿一家の生活費は、僕一人が出しているようなものだ。三木の奴は、あんな奴だから、月末に、家賃三百円。当時は人数が増えたから五百円出しているがね。ともかく、そいつをぽいと手渡したら、それきりでいいんだからね。僕ときたら、下宿代四千円の他に、洗濯その他の雑用費として千五百円提供している。まだ、時折、何のかのと立替金があるのだ。それが積り積ると、どうみても、僕の手から月々八千円前後の金が、お鹿の手へ渡つている事になるんだ。これぢやア僕は、サラリー全部投げ出してもやり切れない。幸いチョコ〜競輪で儲かるものだから、どうにかそれで埋め合せをつけている始末なんだ。全く、お鹿にも三木にも弱つたよ。……」
ハマノは向い側のキャンデー屋のそれを二本買つて来て一本を私に手渡した。樹の間を洩れる真夏の太陽はギラ／＼輝やいて、公園の道……う道は、白く乾きあがつている。
ハマノは私の郷里の者で、私には再従兄弟みたいな関係にある。彼はこの界隈の大観

私は、その二階の明け放たれた窓へ性来の大声を投げつけた。
「おい！ ハマノ、居るかい」
すぐにニヤけたリーゼントヘアののっぺりとした顔が覗くと、それがハマノだった。
「よお、ガンテツのオッサンか。上がれよ」
「嫌だ！ この暑いのに、部屋の中に突っ込んでいられるか！」
私は叱るように怒鳴り上げた。
途端に、下の格子戸がガラリと開いて、この家のマダムのお鹿が、バケツを下げて現れた。咄嗟（とっさ）のことで私は少しドギマギして会釈した。
マダムはニコニコしながら私の方を見て、すぐ傍の共同水道の前にしゃがんだ。27、8にはなるが、顔のまるまると色白の肌で、太い眉がやや気になるが、鼻が大きく鼻筋が通り、日光の下で見ると、太り肉の方でしゃがんだ裾から、新巻き鮭の身のような健康な内股を見せている。
彼女はバケツの中の茶碗や小皿を丹念に洗っているのだ。時折、私の方をチラリと見上げる目付きが、馬鹿に色っぽい。私はマダムの内股から広い腰へ目を逸らした。
「相変わらずガンテツ主義だな。外を歩きゃあ、もっと暑いんだよ」
ハマノが派手な色のアロハを引っ掛けて出てきた。

Part 2: Madam Skunk

1

I, toward that second-floor wide-open window, threw my innate loud voice.
"Hey! Hamano, are you there?"
Immediately, a grinning regent-hair flat face peeked out; that was Hamano.
"Yo, it's Uncle Gantetsu. Come up."
"I refuse! In this heat, how can there be a way to be stuffed inside a room!"
I, as if scolding, shouted up.
At that moment, the lattice door below clattered open, and the Madam of this house, Oshika, appeared carrying a bucket. Because it was a sudden thing, I was a bit flustered and bowed.
Madam, while smiling "nico-nico," looked toward me and crouched in front of the nearby communal water tap. She is around 27 or 28, but her face is round and her skin white; her thick eyebrows are a bit bothersome, but her nose is large and straight; under the sunlight, she is on the plump side. From her crouched hem, she shows healthy inner thighs like the flesh of a salted salmon.
She is diligently washing teacups and small plates in the bucket. Occasionally, the way she glances up at me is terribly sexy. I averted my eyes from Madam's inner thighs to her wide hips.
"As usual, it's the Gantetsu-ism. If you walk outside, it’s even hotter."
Hamano, having thrown on a brightly colored aloha shirt, came out.
He, without even looking toward Madam, started walking alongside me. I thought it was a bit rude, so when I looked back toward Madam, she lowered her head with a "pekori" bow.
We went out to Ogimachi Park. It is the only wooded area in this vicinity and also a resting place for vagrants and "pan-pan" (streetwalkers). To avoid the heat of the tatami rooms, lying down on the grass of such a wooded area and being blown by the natural wind that passes through is the coolest thing.
"Anyway, Gantetsu. What is the business?"
"No, it's nothing big, but... Miki is at work, right?"
"Yeah."
"Actually, the other day, I caught a glimpse of Miki's younger sister. It's presumptuous of me to say, but I want her as a bride for my younger brother. She probably went back to the countryside by now, right?"
"No, she's still here. She probably won't go back. The old lady is stuck here too, it's a mess."
"That is convenient."
"It might be convenient for you, but it’s unbearable for me. Anyway, it’s two rooms of six tatami and four-and-a-half tatami. Miki, for his own selfish reasons, keeps his sister in his room and shoves the old lady into my room. Of course, because of his business, his room is full of tools, so in reality, even at four-and-a-half tatami, my room is wider; it’s become an irregular situation, so it can’t be helped. Every night, I'm forced to smell the old lady's dung-stinking breath and am at my wit's end. Despite that, Oshika-san downstairs is sharp, and thinking maybe I'm doing something with Miki's sister, she tells me to come down and sleep downstairs. I'm thinking of asking to be the gatekeeper at the company president's house instead."
"Um, the Madam's husband—excuse me—the master who was bedridden in the six-tatami room downstairs? What happened? Is he not there?"
"The older brother from Okayama took him back. The brother doesn't like Oshika-san. Oshika-san doesn't like the brother's family either, so she declares she won't go to Okayama even if she dies. Oshika's (from here Hamano calls the Madam by name) husband is hopeless with peritonitis. If he dies, the inheritance entrusted from the previous generation must naturally be passed to Oshika. Because the eldest son is still seven years old. Hating that, the husband's brother took that seven-year-old eldest son away. Of course, he’ll probably remove him from the family registry too. From Oshika’s perspective, she has a refreshed face as if she’s gotten rid of a nuisance, but truly, women... you get the feeling they are monsters. The five-year-old girl was taken as an adopted daughter by Oshika's older sister’s marriage family in Yodogawa. The youngest boy still needs milk, so he’s at the house. If you think about it, it’s like I alone am paying the living expenses for Oshika's family. That guy Miki, being the way he is, pays 300 yen rent at the end of the month. Since the number of people increased, he's paying 500 yen now. Anyway, once he tosses that over, that’s all he does. As for me, besides 4000 yen for lodging, I provide 1500 yen for laundry and other chores. And occasionally, there are various advances for her. When those pile up, no matter how you look at it, about 8000 yen a month passes from my hand to Oshika's. With this, even if I throw away my whole salary, I can't make ends meet. Fortunately, because I make a bit here and there on the bicycle races, I’m somehow making up the difference. Truly, I’m fed up with both Oshika and Miki..."
Hamano went and bought two of those from the candy shop across the street and handed one to me. The midsummer sun leaking through the trees shines "gira-gira," and the park road... the road is dried white.
Hamano is someone from my hometown, and has a relationship like a second cousin to me. He is the grand view of this neighborhood...

**Madam Skunk: Episode 2**

**I**

I hollered up at the wide-open second-story window with the full force of my naturally booming voice. 
"Hey, Hamano! You in there?"
A flat, greasy face with a Regent-style pompadour peeked out immediately. It was Hamano.
"Yo, if it isn't old man Gantetsu. Come on up."
"Not a chance! Who in their right mind would stuff themselves into a cramped room in this heat?" I barked back, sounding more like I was scolding him than greeting him.
Just then, the lattice door on the ground floor rattled open, and Oshika—the "Madam" of the house—appeared, carrying a bucket. Taken off guard, I gave her a flustered, sheepish bow.
She shot me a beaming smile and went straight to the communal tap nearby, where she crouched down to work. She looked to be about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, with a round, pale face. Her thick eyebrows were a bit distracting, but she had a fine, prominent nose. In the bright daylight, she looked rather plump; as she sat there, her kimono hem parted to reveal inner thighs as healthy and pink as a fresh cut of salted salmon.
She was meticulously scrubbing teacups and small plates in her bucket. Every so often, she’d glance up at me with an expression that was disturbingly seductive. I quickly shifted my gaze from her thighs to her broad hips.
"Still sticking to that 'Gantetsu' philosophy of yours, I see," Hamano said, emerging from the house with a loud, garish aloha shirt thrown over his shoulders. "It’s even hotter out here on the pavement."
He didn't spare the Madam a single glance as we started walking. Feeling a bit guilty for the snub, I looked back over my shoulder; she gave me a polite little nod.
We made our way to Ogimachi Park. It was the only patch of green in the area, serving as a sanctuary for the local vagrants and "pan-pan" girls. To escape the stifling heat of the tatami rooms, there was nothing better than sprawling out on the grass under the trees and letting a natural breeze wash over you.
"So, Gantetsu," Hamano asked. "What brings you here?"
"Nothing major... I assume Miki is at work?"
"Yeah."
"To tell you the truth, it's about Miki’s sister. I saw her briefly the other day. It’s a bit forward of me to ask, but I’d like her as a bride for my younger brother. Has she headed back to the country already?"
"No, she’s still here. Might not go back at all, actually. The old lady has planted herself here too. It’s a nightmare."
"Well, that’s convenient for me."
"Convenient for you, maybe, but it’s killing me. We’ve only got two rooms—a six-mat and a four-and-a-half. Miki, selfish as ever, keeps his sister in his room and foists the old lady on me. Since his room is crammed with all his business gear, my four-and-a-half mat room is technically the bigger one, so I’m stuck with her. Every night I have to suffer through the old lady’s breath—which, frankly, reeks like a latrine. It’s miserable. And to top it off, Oshika downstairs is so sharp she’s practically psychic; she thinks maybe I’m sniffing around Miki’s sister, so she’s been telling me to just come down and sleep in her room. Honestly, I’m about ready to go beg for a job as a gatekeeper at the company president's estate."
"And what about the Madam’s husband?" I asked. "The master who was bedridden in that back room—is he gone?"
"His older brother came from Okayama and hauled him back. The brother hates Oshika. And she hates that whole side of the family right back; she says she wouldn’t go to Okayama if her life depended on it. Oshika’s husband—" Hamano dropped the formal title here—"is a goner. Peritonitis. When he kicks off, there’s a family inheritance that’s supposed to go to her, since the eldest son is only seven. To prevent that, the brother made off with the kid. He’ll probably strike him from the family tree, too. Oshika looks relieved, like she’s finally rid of a burden, but man... women are terrifying creatures. The five-year-old girl was sent off to live with Oshika’s sister in Yodogawa as an adoptee. The youngest boy is still nursing, so he’s still here. If you look at the math, I’m basically bankrolling her whole family. Miki is useless; he just tosses her 300 yen for rent at the end of the month—maybe 500 now that there are more bodies. Once he pays that, he considers his hands clean. Me? I pay 4,000 for lodging, plus another 1,500 for laundry and chores. Then there are all the 'advances' she asks for. It adds up to about 8,000 yen a month going straight into her pocket. My entire salary can't cover it. If I weren't winning a bit on the bicycle races, I’d be underwater. I’m at my breaking point with both of them."
Hamano bought two ice pops from the candy stand across the street and handed me one. The midsummer sun blazed through the canopy, and the park paths were baked a chalky white.
Hamano was from my hometown, a sort of second cousin to me. In this neighborhood, he was the local expert on...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout**: This is a standard vertical-text layout typical of Japanese literary magazines (B5 or A5 size). The page is divided into multiple columns. 
*   **Typography**: The font is a traditional Mincho style used for movable type printing. The title "第2話 マダム☆スカンク" is placed in the upper right, with "第2話" enclosed in a decorative rectangular border.
*   **Visual Elements**: A simple line-art illustration is placed near the title. It depicts the midsection of a woman, emphasizing her waist and hips, which mirrors the narrator's preoccupation with the character's physical appearance in the text.
*   **Text Flow**: The narrative uses a mixture of descriptive prose and heavy dialogue. Dialogue is indicated by traditional Japanese corner brackets (「 」). 
*   **Pagination**: The page number "(81)" is visible at the bottom center.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The "Kasutori" Era**: This story belongs to the genre of "popular literature" (taishū bungaku) or perhaps "Kasutori" literature (pulp fiction of the late 40s/early 50s). These stories often focused on the gritty reality of post-war urban life: cramped housing, financial struggles, and casual sexuality.
*   **Housing Conditions**: The mention of "six-mat and four-and-a-half-mat" rooms (*rokujō* and *yojōhan*) highlights the communal and crowded living situations in post-war Japan. Shared kitchens and bathrooms (*kyōdō suidō*) were standard.
*   **Social Roles**:
    *   **Madam**: In this era, "Madam" usually referred to a woman running a boarding house, a bar, or a small business. She is often portrayed as worldly, resilient, and sexually aware.
    *   **Pan-pan**: Mentioned in the text, these were streetwalkers who often catered to occupation GIs or locals. Their presence in parks was a common sight in the 1950s.
*   **Fashion & Subculture**:
    *   **Regent (リーゼント)**: A hairstyle popular among the "bum" or "rebellious" youth (influenced by American greaser culture).
    *   **Aloha Shirt (アロハ)**: Wearing a brightly colored Aloha shirt was a sign of a "modern" or perhaps slightly shady urbanite (often associated with black marketers or *yakuza* in that era).
*   **Gambling (Keirin)**: Bicycle racing (Keirin) was established in 1948 and became a popular way for low-income workers to try to supplement their meager "salary-man" earnings.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Gantetsu (ガンテツ)**: Likely a nickname derived from "stubborn" (*ganko*) or "iron-headed" (*tetsu*). It suggests a character who is old-fashioned or rigid.
*   **Aramaki-no-sake (荒巻の鮭)**: Salted salmon wrapped in straw. Used as a metaphor for the Madam's healthy, pinkish-white skin.
*   **Pekori (ぺこり)**: Onomatopoeia for a quick, polite bow.
*   **San-pachi (商売がら)**: Though the text says "shōbai-gara" (due to his business), "San-pachi" (3-8) was often slang for brokerage or middleman work.
*   **Oujou (往生)**: Meaning "to be at one's wit's end" or "to give up."
*   **Fun-shū-kusai (糞𦤎臭い)**: A very vulgar way to say someone's breath smells like excrement.
*   **Sei-sei shita (せい／＼した)**: Feeling refreshed or relieved after getting rid of a burden.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Poverty and the "New Woman"**: The story explores the economic burden placed on young men in the post-war era. Hamano is frustrated that he is essentially supporting a woman and her children, yet he is clearly attracted to her ("terribly sexy").
*   **The "Monster" Woman**: Hamano refers to women as "monsters" (*mamono*). This reflects a common post-war literary trope where women were seen as survivors who would do anything—including exploiting men or abandoning family members—to get by.
*   **Urban Anomie**: The setting of the park as a place for "vagrants and streetwalkers" emphasizes a sense of societal breakdown and the search for "natural" relief from the artificial, crowded heat of the city.
*   **The Marriage Market**: The narrator (Gantetsu) is acting as a traditional intermediary, looking for a bride for his brother, showing that traditional customs still existed alongside the "Regent" hair and "Aloha shirts" of the new generation.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type**: Fiction, Short Story (Shōsetsu).
*   **Genre**: Pulp Fiction, Social Realism, Mid-century Drama.
*   **Thematic Tags**: Post-war Japan, Urban Poverty, Gender Dynamics, Romance (Cynical), Family Struggles.
