## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

今度は、カマキリが、やたらに腕を振り廻して喚いた。
「チエッ、豚箱へ放りこんだときや白状するだらう、しいつびいてゆけッ！」
カンボテはプリプリしてドシン／＼と靴音をたて先頭を切って部屋を出ていった。

翌日、哥力達を使って大々的に海岸の死体検索を行ったが、波にさらわれたか、それとも、悪人達が夜の内にどこかへかくしたのか、全然手がかりさえ掴めなかつた。
一方、警察署では二人の容疑者の取調べを開始した。
事件に直接関係を持つているらしい例のでつぷりした男の素性を洗ってみると、兇悪極まる前科を持つた無頼漢でも何でもない、ゴク温順い人間でカフェービンタンマラムのマネージャーであつた。
「前科者でない者は犯人ではない」
気短かのカパラポリシー（警察署長）はそういつてサジを投げたが、カンボテは
「いや、前科者になるまでの犯人は前科者でなかつたか、それが前科者になるんですから前科者でない犯人も前科者になりますぜ」
とやりかえしてトコトンまで男を追及したが知らぬ存ぜぬ。果ては石地蔵みたいに黙つてしまうのでいつこうにラチがあかない。動かぬ証拠があるから彼が手をかけたのに違いないのだがらなだめつゝすかしつゝ、タマにはムリして貰をやった衣類や財布をつきつけて、やつと口を割らしたところが、何故あんな所にあったのか知りもしなければ責任もないとうそぶいて仕末におえない。
厚化粧をして毒々しく口紅を塗つているところをみると春をひさいでいる女に違いないが、顔立ちは上品で、ビンタンマラムにはちょつといない美人だ。男と二人きりで同じ部屋にいたところをみると口惜しいが彼の情婦らしい。前身を洗つてみたが不思議なことに彼女の素性はてんで分らない。カフェービンタンマラムには大分まえからいたらしいが何処に家があつてどういうところから通つているのかチンプン分らない魔物みたいな女なのである。
ところが、三日目になつて、今まで気づかなかつた重大な足跡がついた。女が肘のあたりに、そうとう深い傷を負っており、上衣の袖でかくしていたので今まで気がつかなかつたが、繃帯と傷口の新しいところからみて、どうもあの夜受けたものらしいと推定された。カンボテはキンキジャクヤクよい／＼動かし難い証拠を発見したというのでぎゆう／＼責めたてたがシブトイ奴で貝殻みたいに口を閉じて開かない。で遂に白状するまで一週間の断食を申渡した。
一方マリアームの夫の素性を洗つたが、アンボン中のカフェー、映画館、劇場などをしらみつぶしに当つてみたが楽師として雇入れたこともなければそんな男はみたことも聞いたこともないと口を揃えていうのだつた。では、どういう商売で金儲けをしていたかとあらゆる職業方面に当りをつけて聞き込みをやつたがカイモク分らない。
マリアームとの結婚前の行跡を洗つてみると、そこに、ひとつの疑点が見出された。つまり、彼は、いつも夕方出かけて朝帰つてきたというのである。それも、どこへ出かけて行くのかと、ごていねいにいつて行つたという男の話によると、ヤレ嬉しいや、矢張り彼はビンタンマラムの前で立止り、きょろ／＼周囲を警戒してから、こっそり中へ這入つていつたというのである。
それによつて、彼も、カフェービンタンマラムで無頼漢共と一緒に悪事を働くか、美女をめぐつての恋愛チャンバラでもやらかして殺されたのかも知れないと思われる。
マリアームとの結婚については、両親を呼び出して問い糺したが、娘が惚れて申込んだので別に詳しく素性も調べていないというのだ。こうなるとろくでもない所を探つたみたいで益々ややこしくなつてきた。
そこへもつてきて、また、マリアームのところへ、変な手紙が舞いこんできた。開いてみると五千円近くの彼女の名儀になつている貯金通帳が同封されている。手紙には、自分は或る所に生きているが殺されるかも知れないから今まで儲けた金をおまえ名儀にして預けた通帳を同封した。自由に使っておくれ、勇気を出せばまた生きて会うことができるか知れないが、もう、自分は、元のようにおまえと一緒に楽しく暮すことはできないだろう。自分が

今度は、カマキリが、やたらに腕を振り回して喚いた。
「ちえっ、豚箱へ放り込んだときゃ白状するだろう、引きずっていけッ！」
カンボテはプリプリしてドシンドシンと靴音を立て、先頭を切って部屋を出ていった。

翌日、苦力（クーリー）たちを使って大々的に海岸の死体捜索を行ったが、波にさらわれたか、あるいは、悪人たちが夜の内にどこかへ隠したのか、全然手がかりさえ掴めなかった。
一方、警察署では二人の容疑者の取調べを開始した。
事件に直接関係を持っているらしい例の太った男の素性を洗ってみると、凶悪極まる前科を持った無頼漢でも何でもない、ごく温順な人間で「カフェ・ビンタン・マラム」のマネージャーであった。
「前科者でない者は犯人ではない」
短気なカパラ・ポリシー（警察署長）はそう言って投げ出したが、カンボテは、
「いや、前科者になるまでの犯人は前科者ではなかったか、それが前科者になるんですから、前科者でない犯人も前科者になりますぜ」
とやり返して、とことんまで男を追及したが、「知らぬ存ぜぬ」の一点張り。果ては石地蔵のように黙ってしまうので、いっこうに埒（らち）が明かない。動かぬ証拠があるから彼が手を下したのに違いないのだが、なだめたり透かしたり、時には無理やり押収した衣類や財布を突きつけて、やっと口を割らせたところが、「何故あんな所にあったのか知りもしないし責任もない」とうそぶいて始末に負えない。

厚化粧をしてどぎつく口紅を塗っているところを見ると、売春をしている女に違いないが、顔立ちは上品で、「ビンタン・マラム」にはちょっといない美人だ。男と二人きりで同じ部屋にいたところを見ると、癪だが彼の情婦らしい。前歴を洗ってみたが、不思議なことに彼女の素性はさっぱり分からない。「カフェ・ビンタン・マラム」にはだいぶ前からいたらしいが、どこに家があって、どこから通っているのかちんぷんかんぷんな、魔物のような女なのである。
ところが、三日目になって、今まで気づかなかった重大な痕跡が見つかった。女が肘のあたりに相当深い傷を負っており、上着の袖で隠していたので今まで気がつかなかったが、包帯と傷口の新しさから見て、どうもあの夜負ったものらしいと推定された。カンボテは「欣喜雀躍（きんきじゃくやく）」、いよいよ動かし難い証拠を発見したというので厳しく責め立てたが、しぶとい奴で貝殻のように口を閉じて開かない。そこで、ついに白状するまで一週間の断食を申し渡した。

一方、マリアムの夫の素性を洗ったが、アンボン中のカフェ、映画館、劇場などをしらみつぶしに当たってみたが、楽師として雇い入れたこともなければ、そんな男は見たことも聞いたこともないと口を揃えて言うのだった。では、どういう商売で金儲けをしていたかと、あらゆる職業方面に見当をつけて聞き込みを行ったが、全く分からない。
マリアムとの結婚前の素行を洗ってみると、そこに一つの不審点が見出された。つまり、彼はいつも夕方出かけて朝帰ってきたというのである。それも、どこへ出かけて行くのかと、ご丁寧に話してくれた男によると、やはり彼は「ビンタン・マラム」の前で立ち止まり、きょろきょろと周囲を警戒してから、こっそり中へ入っていったというのである。
それによって、彼も「カフェ・ビンタン・マラム」で無頼漢共と一緒に悪事を働くか、美女をめぐる色恋沙汰の喧嘩でもやらかして殺されたのかも知れないと思われる。
マリアムとの結婚については、両親を呼び出して問い質したが、娘が惚れて申し込んだので、別に詳しく素性も調べていないというのだ。こうなると、つまらない場所を調べたようで、ますますややこしくなってきた。
そこへ持ってきて、また、マリアムのところへ、変な手紙が舞い込んできた。開いてみると五千円近くの彼女の名義になっている貯金通帳が同封されている。手紙には、「自分はある所に生きているが、殺されるかも知れないから、今まで儲けた金をお前名義にして預けた通帳を同封した。自由に使っておくれ。勇気を出せばまた生きて会うことができるかも知れないが、もう自分は元のように、お前と一緒に楽しく暮らすことはできないだろう。自分が……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

This time, Kamakiri (Mantis), excessively arms swinging around, shouted.
"Tche, when thrown into the pig-box (jail) they will confess probably, drag them away!"
Kanbote, being huffing and puffing, "thud-thud" with shoe sounds making, taking the lead, the room exited.

III

Next day, using coolies, on a large scale the coast's corpse search was performed, but whether by waves carried away, or, by bad people during the night somewhere hidden, even a clue at all could not be grasped.
On the other hand, at the police station, two suspects' interrogation started.
In the incident direct relation having-seeming that fat man's background when washed (investigated), extreme atrocious criminal record possessing rascal or anything not, very gentle human being and "Cafe Bintang Maram"'s manager was.
"He who is not a former convict is not a criminal."
Short-tempered Kepala Polisi (Police Chief) so saying threw the spoon (gave up), but Kanbote:
"No, the criminal until becoming a former convict was not a former convict? Because that person becomes a former convict, even a criminal who is not a former convict becomes a former convict."
Thus replied and to the very end the man pursued but "know not, aware not." Eventually like a stone Jizo statue becoming silent, at all progress does not open. Because there is unmoving evidence, that he laid hands [on it] there is no mistake, while soothing and coaxing, sometimes forcibly showing the clothes or wallet received, finally the mouth when made to split (confess), why in such a place [the items] were he neither knows nor has responsibility, he boasted and was unmanageable.

Heavy makeup having and poisonously lipstick applying when seen, selling spring (prostituting) woman without mistake, but facial features are elegant, in Bintang Maram a little-not-seen beauty. With a man two people only in the same room was when seen, it is vexing but his mistress seems. Previous history when washed, mysteriously her background at all is not known. In Cafe Bintang Maram from a long time ago seemed to be, but where a house is and what kind of place from she commutes is "ching-pun-kan-pun" (gibberish/unknown), a monster-like woman she is.
However, on the third day becoming, until now not noticed important footprint (trace) was attached. The woman on the elbow area, fairly deep wound was bearing, and with the upper garment's sleeve was hiding so until now did not notice, but from the bandage and the wound's newness looking, surely that night received thing it seems it was estimated. Kanbote was "jumping for joy," finally unmoving evidence discovered so "tightly-tightly" (hard) interrogated, but a stubborn fellow and like a seashell the mouth closed and does not open. So at last until confessing one week's fasting was ordered.

On the other hand, Mariam's husband's background was washed, throughout Ambon's cafes, movie theaters, theaters, etc. "louse-crushing" (thoroughly) searched, but as a musician employed even once not, such a man seen or heard people even once not, with one mouth they said. Then, by what kind of business money-making was doing, toward every occupation direction aim putting and inquiries did but "kaimoku" (at all) not known.
Mariam-with before marriage conduct when washed, there, one doubt-point was found. That is, he always in the evening went out and morning-returned, it is said. That also, where to going out, to a man who politely spoke according to, "oh joy," as expected he in front of Bintang Maram stopped, "kyoro-kyoro" (restlessly) surroundings guarding after, secretly inside crawled-in, it is said.
By that, he also, at Cafe Bintang Maram with rascals together evil deeds working, or over a beautiful woman a love-sword-fight even doing was killed maybe, it is thought.
Regarding the marriage with Mariam, parents were called out and questioned, but the daughter fell in love and applied so particularly in detail background even not searched, they say. This becoming, a worthless place searched-like, more and more complicated it became.
To that brought, also, to Mariam's place, a strange letter flew in. When opened, near 5,000 yen her name-under becoming savings passbook was enclosed. In the letter, "I in a certain place am living but might be killed so until now earned money in your name deposited passbook enclosed. Freely please use, if courage put out again living can meet maybe, but already, I, like the original with you fun-living cannot probably. I..."

Kamakiri brandished his arms wildly and barked, "Dammit! Once they're thrown in the slammer, they’ll sing. Drag 'em out of here!"
Bristling with rage, Kanbote stormed out of the room, his boots thumping rhythmically against the floor as he led the way.

**III**

The following day, a massive search of the coastline was conducted using a crew of coolies. However, whether the body had been swept away by the tide or hidden away by the villains under the cover of night, not a single clue was found.
Meanwhile, the police station began interrogating the two suspects.
When they investigated the background of the portly man who seemed directly involved in the incident, he turned out to be no hardened criminal or thug; he was a perfectly mild-mannered man who served as the manager of the "Cafe Bintang Maram."
"A man without a record isn't our killer," the short-tempered *Kepala Polisi* (Police Chief) declared, washing his hands of the matter.
But Kanbote shot back, "Listen, every convict was a man without a record until he committed his first crime. That’s how they get a record in the first place! A criminal without a record is just a convict in the making."
He pursued the man relentlessly, but the suspect feigned total ignorance. Eventually, he shut down entirely, becoming as silent as a stone statue, and the investigation ground to a halt. Kanbote was certain the man was involved—there was hard evidence, after all. He tried playing good cop and bad cop, at times even shoving the confiscated clothes and wallet in the man's face, but when the suspect finally spoke, he simply sneered that he had no idea why those items were there and bore no responsibility for them. He was utterly incorrigible.

As for the woman, her heavy makeup and garish lipstick marked her clearly as a lady of the night, yet her features were refined—a beauty rarely seen at the Bintang Maram. It was galling to think she was the mistress of that man, given they were caught alone in a room together. Her background was a complete mystery. She had apparently been at the Bintang Maram for some time, but no one had the slightest clue where she lived or where she came from. She was a phantom-like creature.
However, on the third day, a vital piece of evidence finally came to light. The woman had a deep wound near her elbow. She had been hiding it with her sleeve, but the freshness of the wound and the bandages suggested it was sustained on the night of the incident. Kanbote was overjoyed. Believing he had finally found the "smoking gun," he interrogated her mercilessly, but she was a tough nut to crack, her mouth clamped shut like a clam. In the end, he sentenced her to a week of fasting until she confessed.

Meanwhile, an investigation into Mariam’s husband turned up nothing. They scoured every cafe, cinema, and theater in Ambon, but everyone told the same story: they had never hired him as a musician, nor had they ever seen or heard of such a man. They checked every possible trade to see how he might have been making his money, but they hit a total dead end.
Looking into his life before he married Mariam, however, they found a suspicious pattern. He apparently went out every evening and didn't return until morning. According to a man who had observed him, he would always stop in front of the Bintang Maram, look around shiftily to make sure he wasn't being followed, and then slip inside.
This suggested that he was either in league with the thugs at the Cafe Bintang Maram or had perhaps been killed in a brawl over a woman.
When Mariam's parents were brought in and questioned about the marriage, they claimed they hadn't looked into his background because their daughter had fallen in love and insisted on the match. It felt like the investigation was chasing shadows; the deeper they dug, the more convoluted it became.
To make matters worse, a strange letter arrived for Mariam. Inside was a savings passbook in her name with nearly 5,000 yen in it. The letter read: "I am alive and hiding, but I may be killed. I have enclosed this passbook with the money I’ve earned, deposited in your name. Please use it freely. If we are brave, perhaps we may meet again, but I fear I can never return to our happy life together. I..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in two vertical columns, a standard format for Japanese periodicals. 
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style. The use of emphasis marks (repetition marks like 「／＼」 for "doshin-doshin") is characteristic of pre-digital printing.
*   **Illustration:** A prominent, stylized illustration sits in the lower center. It features a woman in a state of partial undress (a common trope in "kasutori" pulp magazines to attract male readers), looking toward the viewer or into the distance, with smaller, sketchy faces of men in the background. The art style is reminiscent of late-1940s/early-1950s "erotic-grotesque" (*ero-guro*) pulp art.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The section marker "三" (Three) indicates a serialized story or a chapter break. The text uses brackets for dialogue, creating a narrative flow typical of popular fiction.
*   **Contextual Clues:** The name "Bintang Maram" (Indonesian/Malay for "Midnight Star") and "Ambon" (a city in Indonesia) immediately establish the exotic Southeast Asian setting.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text is representative of the "Kasutori" era (approx. 1946-1955). Named after a cheap, low-quality sake, *kasutori* magazines were pulp publications that focused on mystery, sex, and the "exotic." They were cheap to produce and very popular in the struggling post-war years.
*   **The "South Seas" (Nanyo) Fascination:** During and after WWII, Japan had a complex relationship with Southeast Asia. Tales of mystery and romance set in the former occupied territories (like Indonesia/Ambon) were common, blending nostalgia with the "exotic" and dangerous allure of the tropics.
*   **Currency:** The mention of "5,000 yen" provides a chronological marker. In the late 1940s, 5,000 yen was a significant sum (a monthly salary for a white-collar worker might be around 500-1,000 yen in 1946, rising rapidly due to inflation).
*   **Kepala Polisi:** The text uses the term "カパラポリシー" (Kapara Porishii), a transliteration of the Indonesian *Kepala Polisi* (Police Chief). This shows the author's attempt to provide local flavor.
*   **Coolies (哥力/苦力):** The use of the term "coolie" reflects the colonial/occupational era's language regarding manual laborers in Asia.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Femme Fatale:** Mariam is portrayed as a "monster-like" (魔物) woman whose beauty and unknown background make her dangerous and alluring—a classic trope in hard-boiled and noir fiction.
*   **Colonial/Post-Colonial Noir:** The setting of Ambon, with its mix of cafes, police stations, and mysterious foreigners/locals, creates a "noir" atmosphere where the social order is tenuous.
*   **Class and Criminality:** The dialogue about whether one is a "former convict" reflects a cynical, deterministic view of the law—once you are in the system, you are a criminal.
