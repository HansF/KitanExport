**珍話：墨の貞操帯**

明治11年5月、深川区森下町の人力車夫・萩原林蔵（30）は、いたって生真面目な男にて、毎日仕事に出る前には女房のおかつ（25）のどこかへ墨で印をして、帰宅した時にとくと調べ、それからまた印をして出かけるのであった。女房も馬鹿馬鹿しくはあり、うるさくも思えども、これまた評判の正直な女なれば、亭主のなすままに任せていたが、このところ林蔵の弟の亀吉という者が同町に引っ越してきて、ここへ遊びに来るのを兄は大不承知であった。

それより後は、昼の一度では済まず、日に三、四度も帰り来ては、かまどに当たっていれば大層腹を立てて当たり散らし、「臭いが変だ」「色が怪しい」と、下手な衛生家が土用に牛肉を買うようにやかましく小言を言うので、おかつも耐えきれず、四五日後に本港町の親戚の方へ逃げ行き、委細を話して「とても私には辛抱ができません」と言う折から、林蔵は例の検査に戻り来た。おかつがいないので狂ったように諸方を尋ね、ついにこの家へ来て女房の顔を見るなり怒鳴り込み、手を取って連れ帰ろうとするのを、親戚の者が止めてこれまでの心得違いをいろいろと説得したところ、林蔵は一言もなく詫び入って帰った。しかしそれより一層、右の検査が厳しくなり、その後は仕事にも出さずに朝からあれこれと口やかましく罵ったので、流石のおかつも愛想が尽きて、一昨日当局へ訴え出たとのこと。これは女房の苦情がもっともである。（東京日々新聞より）

船岡六助が堺刑務所を釈放されたのは、島祭りの三日目だった。五年ぶりに見る街の情景はことごとくが目新しく、六助は思わず目を見張った。五年前にはあまり見なかったと言ってよい島の女たちのパーマ、最近流行のロングスカート、肌もあらわな薄物のドレスを着た女。それらは彼の視覚に妖しく踊った。長い間、異性から隔絶された世界にいた六助の眼には、行き交う女のすべてが法外な美しさに見えた。出口を固く抑えられていた情欲が、五年前の抑制に拍車をかけられて泉のように溢れてくるのを制御することもできなかった。彼の刑務所入りの罪名は、若い人妻に対する強盗殺人未遂罪であった。

六助は島祭りの人混みを縫って海岸通りの自分の家へ急いだ。家といっても商店街の裏の、馬小屋のような崩れかかった長屋の一角だったが、そこには同様に一ヶ月で別れた「さゆみ」がただ一人で住んでいるはずだった。面識のない床屋で無精髭を剃り落とし、急いで長屋へ飛び込んだ六助の目に真っ先に映ったものは何であったろうか。それは風鈴と共に吊るされた、子供のがらがらであった。咄嗟に他人の家ではないかと迷ったが、そんなはずはない。疑惑に満ちた眼をぐるぐるさせて敷居をまたいだ。中には汚れたシミーズ一枚の女が赤子と一緒に寝そべっていた。

「誰っ？」女は振り返った。「あっ！」
「さゆみ、それは誰の子だっ」六助は赤子を見つめながら、ぎしっと座敷へ飛び上がった。さゆみのぽかんと開いた口がさっと歪み、見る影もなくやつれた顔が蒼白になった。「あんた、帰ってきたのね」
「帰ったのがいけないか！」「いいえ、でも、あんたの刑期は八年じゃなかったの？」
六助は部屋の中をぐるぐると見回していたが、そこに男の衣類や帽子を発見すると、赤子に鋭い憎悪の眼を向けた。生後一年そこそこである。「貴様、俺を裏切ったな」
「裏切るなんて、そんなわけじゃないけど、でも、よく考えてごらんよ……こんな時代に女一人で生きられると思うの？わたしの顔をつぶしてしまうような忌まわしい罪を犯しておきながら、その男が刑務所から出てくるのを八年も待ってるものですか」
「何だと、おい、よくも言ったな」六助は激しく詰め寄った。
「ええ、いくらでも言いますとも。もともとこの長屋だって、死んだお父さんが借りていたんじゃないの。それをあんたたち、お父さんが死ぬのを待ち構えていたように乗り込んできて、わたしをめちゃめちゃにしてしまったんじゃないか」
「ふん、それが五年ぶりに帰ってきた亭主に言う言葉か」
「誰がお前さんなんぞと……馬鹿馬鹿しい。私には金次っていうちゃんとした夫があるんですよ」
さゆみは冷淡に言って顔を背けた。「馬鹿ッ」
六助は手近な七輪にかけてあった薬缶をひったくって投げつけた。湯は冷えていたが、さゆみの肢体にはね返って、汚れた畳の上に地図を描いた。その物音に目覚めた赤子は火がついたように泣き出した。さゆみは赤子をかばって後ずさりしながら「ここは妾（わたし）の家よ、出て行って！」とヒステリックに叫んだ。
六助の狂暴性は彼の自制心を奪い、さゆみを所嫌わず殴りつけた。さゆみは真っ赤な鼻血を垂らしてヒーヒーと泣きわめいた。何事かと驚いて飛び出してきた近所の人々は、「六助じゃないか」「悪い奴が戻ってきたな」「これは金さんが帰ってきたら面白いことになるぜ」と口々に言うが、他人事（ひとごと）は面白いと見えて決して止めようとしない。
「どうしたんだ？」と飛び込んできた男があった。「あっ、金さんだよ」
それは折悪くも仕事場から飯に帰ってきた金次だった。さゆみが殴られているのを見た彼は、脱兎のごとく走り込んで六助の前に立ちはだかった。

**Strange Story: The Ink Chastity Belt**

Meiji 11, May. Fukagawa Ward, Morishita-cho rickshaw puller Hagiwara Rinzo (30) was an extremely serious/honest man; every day before going to work, on wife Okatsu's (25) somewhere, with ink he made a mark, and when returning home, thoroughly inspected it, and then again made a mark and went out. Wife also, although it was foolish and she thought it annoying, this woman being a famously honest woman, let him do as husband does; however, recently, Rinzo's younger brother named Kamekich moved to the same town, and to his coming over to play, the older brother was greatly disapproving.

From then on, not finishing with just once at noon, returning three or four times a day, if she was by the hearth he would become very angry and vent his rage, "The smell is strange," "The color is suspicious," like a poor hygienist buying beef during the Midsummer Day of the Ox, noisily grumbling; Okatsu, unable to endure it, after four or five days fled to relatives in Honminato-cho, and explaining the details said "I absolutely cannot bear this," just at that time Rinzo returned for the usual inspection. Because Okatsu was not there, like a madman he searched various places, finally came to this house, as soon as he saw his wife's face he barged in shouting, and tried to take her hand and lead her home, but a certain person stopped him and explained his various misunderstandings, then Rinzo without a word apologized and returned. However, after that, the aforementioned inspection became even stricter, and after that he wouldn't let her go to work and from morning was mouth-noisy with insults, so as expected Okatsu's affection ran out, and the day before yesterday she appealed to the authorities. This wife's complaint is reasonable. (From Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun)

When Funaoka Rokunosuke was released from Sakai Prison, it was the third day of the Island Festival. The street scenery seen for the first time in five years was entirely new, and Rokunosuke unintentionally widened his eyes. Island women's "perms" which one could say were rarely seen five years ago, recently popular long skirts, women wearing thin fabric dresses exposing skin. Those danced eerily in his vision. For a long time, having been in a world isolated from the opposite sex, in Rokunosuke's eyes every passing woman looked extraordinarily beautiful. His lust, which had its outlet tightly suppressed, was spurred by five years of restraint and he couldn't control it as it overflowed like a spring. The name of the crime for which he entered prison was attempted robbery-murder against a young housewife.

Rokunosuke, threading through the crowds of the Island Festival, hurried to his own house on the coast road. Even calling it a house, it was a corner of a crumbling tenement like a stable behind the shopping street, but there, Sayumi, whom he had separated from after just one month [of marriage], was supposed to be living alone. At an unfamiliar barber shop he shaved off his stubble and jumped into the tenement; what was the first thing reflected in Rokunosuke's eyes? It was a child's rattle hung with a wind chime. Instantly he wondered if it was someone else's house, but that couldn't be. With eyes full of suspicion rolling around, he stepped over the threshold. Inside, a woman in a single dirty chemise was lying down with an infant.

"Who?!" The woman looked back. "Ah!"
"Sayumi, whose child is that!" Rokunosuke, staring at the infant, jumped up onto the tatami floor with a creak. Sayumi's agape mouth suddenly twisted, and her haggard face became pale. "You, you've come back."
"Is it bad that I've come back?!" "No, but, wasn't your prison term eight years?"
Rokunosuke was looking around the room, and when he discovered a man's clothing and hat, he turned eyes of sharp hatred toward the infant. It was barely a year after birth. "You, you betrayed me."
"Betrayed... it's not like that, but, think about it... do you think a woman can live alone in these times? While you committed such a loathsome crime that ruined my reputation, do you think I'd wait eight years for that man to come out of prison?"
"What, hey, you've got a lot of nerve saying that." Rokunosuke aggressively approached her.
"Yes, I'll say it as much as I want. Originally, even this tenement, wasn't it my dead father who rented it? You lot, as if waiting for my father to die, barged in and made a mess of me, didn't you?"
"Humph, are those words to say to a husband returning after five years?"
"Who's calling someone like you [husband]... ridiculous. I have a proper husband named Kinji."
Sayumi said coldly and turned her face away. "Fool!"
Rokunosuke grabbed a kettle that was on a nearby shichirin (brazier) and threw it. The water was cold, but it splashed off Sayumi's body and drew a map on the dirty tatami. At that noise, the infant woke up and began crying like a house on fire. Sayumi, protecting the infant while backing away, screamed hysterically, "This is my house, get out!"
Rokunosuke's brutality robbed him of self-control, and he struck Sayumi regardless of where. Sayumi, dripping bright red nosebleed, wailed and cried. The neighbors who jumped out surprised by the commotion said, "Isn't that Rokunosuke?" "A bad guy has come back," "This will be interesting when Kin-san gets back," each saying so, but since other people's problems are entertaining, they didn't try to stop it at all.
"What's happened?" a man came jumping in. "Ah, it's Kin-san."
It was Kinji, who had unfortunately returned from his workplace for a meal. Seeing Sayumi being beaten, he ran in like a bolting rabbit and stood in Rokunosuke's way.

**Curious Tales: The Ink Chastity Belt**

In May of the 11th year of Meiji (1878), there lived a rickshaw puller named Rinzo Hagiwara in the Morishita neighborhood of Fukagawa. He was a man of excessive, almost obsessive, earnestness. Every morning before heading out for work, he would mark his twenty-five-year-old wife, Okatsu, with a dab of ink on a hidden part of her body. Upon his return, he would meticulously inspect the mark before reapplying a new one for his next shift. Okatsu found the practice absurd and irritating, but being a woman of celebrated honesty and devotion, she dutifully submitted to her husband’s whims.

However, trouble brewed when Rinzo’s younger brother, Kamekich, moved into the neighborhood and began visiting. Deeply suspicious, Rinzo began returning home three or four times a day instead of just once at noon. He would fly into rages if he found her near the hearth, sniffing her clothes and complaining of "strange smells" or "suspicious colors," fussing like a pedantic health inspector examining beef at the height of summer. Unable to bear it, Okatsu eventually fled to a relative’s house in Honminato. Rinzo tracked her down, nearly losing his mind, and tried to drag her home by force. It took the intervention of a relative to talk sense into him, leading to a temporary apology. Yet, the "inspections" only grew more frequent and severe, with Rinzo eventually forbidding her from working and spending his days hurling verbal abuse. Finally reaching her breaking point, Okatsu filed a formal complaint with the authorities two days ago—a plea the public deems entirely justified. (Source: Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun)

***

The day Funaoka Rokunosuke was released from Sakai Prison happened to be the third day of the Island Festival. After five years behind bars, the world felt startlingly new. He stared in disbelief at the women of the island: many now sported "permanent waves" in their hair, a rarity five years prior, while others wore the latest long skirts or sheer, provocative dresses that left little to the imagination. To a man who had been isolated from women for half a decade, every passing female seemed impossibly beautiful. His long-suppressed lust, coiled tight by five years of deprivation, threatened to burst forth like a dammed spring. He had been imprisoned for the attempted robbery and murder of a young housewife.

Rokunosuke pushed through the festive crowds toward his old home on the coast road—a ramshackle corner of a tenement house behind the shopping district that resembled a stable more than a residence. He expected to find Sayumi there, the woman he had married and lived with for only a month before his arrest. After a quick stop at an unfamiliar barber to shave his rough stubble, he burst into the room. The first thing his eyes landed on was a baby’s rattle hanging next to a wind chime. He froze, wondering if he had entered the wrong house, but the layout was unmistakable. With eyes darting in suspicion, he stepped inside. There, sprawled on the floor in nothing but a soiled chemise, was Sayumi, lying next to an infant.

"Who’s there?" she gasped, turning around. Her eyes widened. "Ah!"
"Sayumi! Whose brat is this?" Rokunosuke demanded, the floorboards creaking as he lunged into the room. Sayumi’s mouth fell open; her haggard, worn face turned deathly pale. 
"You... you’re back."
"Is it a crime for a man to come home?" 
"No... but wasn't your sentence eight years?"
Rokunosuke scanned the room until he spotted a man’s clothes and a hat. He glared at the infant—barely a year old—with pure venom. "You bitch, you betrayed me."
"Betrayed you? It’s not that simple," she retorted, her voice trembling but defiant. "Think for a moment. Do you think a woman can survive alone in these times? You committed a loathsome crime that shamed me, and you expected me to wait eight years for a man like you?"
"What did you say?" He closed in on her.
"I’ll say it again! This tenement was my father's. You and your lot barged in here the moment he died and ruined my life!"
"Is that any way to talk to the husband who’s been away for five years?"
"Who are you calling 'husband'? Don't be ridiculous. I have a real husband now—Kinji."
She turned away coldly. "You fool!"
Enraged, Rokunosuke snatched a kettle from the brazier and hurled it at her. The water inside was cold, but it splashed across her body and pooled on the tatami like an ugly map. The noise woke the baby, who began to wail hysterically. Sayumi shielded the child, backing away. "This is *my* house! Get out!" she shrieked.
The old violence took hold of him. He began beating her indiscriminately. As Sayumi wailed, blood streaming from her nose, neighbors gathered at the door. "Is that Rokunosuke?" "The bad seed is back." "Wait until Kinji gets home; then the real show starts." They watched with morbid curiosity, making no move to intervene.
"What's going on here?" a man shouted, bursting through the door. 
"It's Kinji!" someone cried.
Kinji, having returned early from work for his midday meal, saw Sayumi being struck. Like a bolt of lightning, he threw himself between her and Rokunosuke.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tategaki*). It features a header for the column ("Strange Story") and a title for the specific piece. 
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. It uses a mix of *Kanji* and *Kana*. Notably, it uses some older character forms (*kyūjitai*) and historical kana usage (*rekishiteki kanazukai*), such as 區 (区), 爲 (為), and づ instead of ず in some contexts, suggesting a publication date between the late 1940s and early 1960s.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "Ink Chastity Belt" is slightly larger and bolder. The first story serves as an anecdotal "preface" or a historical example of the theme, followed by a longer, more contemporary (to the era) narrative. 
*   **Structure:** The piece is divided into two distinct parts. The first is a short historical anecdote (dated Meiji 11) attributed to the *Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun*. The second is a more descriptive, fictionalized "pulp" narrative about a convict returning home.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Meiji 11 Reference:** The first story is set in 1878, a period of rapid Westernization in Japan. However, the story highlights the persistence of "feudal" or archaic attitudes toward women and domestic control.
*   **Teisōtai (Chastity Belt):** In Japan, "chastity belts" were rarely physical metal devices. Instead, suspicious husbands often used "ink marks" or "hidden signatures" (often on the inner thigh or belly) to ensure their wives hadn't bathed or been touched while they were away. This was a common trope in *Edo-era* and *Meiji-era* gossip columns.
*   **Post-War "Pulp" Context:** The second story mentions "perms" (permanent waves) and "long skirts," which were fashion trends that became widespread in the 1950s. The mention of a "chemise" (シミーズ) also points to the mid-Showa era.
*   **Social Class:** Both stories focus on the lower working class (*rickshaw pullers*, *tenement dwellers*). These stories often appeared in magazines catering to a male audience, blending elements of crime, domestic drama, and eroticism (the "Ero-Guro" genre).

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **恪氣深き (Kakki-fukaki):** An archaic or literary way to describe someone who is overly serious, stiff, or temperamental. 
*   **衛生家 (Eiseika):** A "hygienist." The comparison to an "unskilled hygienist" inspecting beef is a colorful Meiji-era idiom for someone being overly pedantic or suspicious about cleanliness/purity.
*   **島祭り (Shima-matsuri):** Refers to a festival on an island. Given the mention of "Sakai Prison" (located in Osaka), the "Island" likely refers to one of the islands in the Inland Sea or perhaps a specific local district known as "The Island."
*   **七輪 (Shichirin):** A small charcoal grill/brazier used for cooking and heating. Throwing the kettle from the shichirin is a classic trope of domestic violence in Japanese period dramas.
*   **脱兎の如く (Datto no gotoku):** "Like a bolting rabbit," an idiom meaning to move extremely fast.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Male Jealousy and Control:** The central theme is the male desire to control female sexuality through marking (ink) or violence. The "Ink Chastity Belt" is a metaphor for the psychological shackles men placed on women.
*   **The "Returning Soldier/Convict" Trope:** A common post-war narrative involves a man returning after a long absence (war or prison) to find that the world has moved on and his "property" (his wife) has been taken by another.
*   **Economic Desperation:** Sayumi’s defense—"Do you think a woman can live alone in these times?"—highlights the lack of social safety nets for women whose husbands were imprisoned or dead.
*   **The "Gaze" of the Neighbors:** The neighbors' reaction (watching the violence for entertainment) reflects a cynical, "pulp" view of society where human suffering is merely a spectacle for the bored masses.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction / Short Story (Pulp Noir)
*   **Genre:** Domestic Drama, Crime, Sensationalist (Ero-Guro-Nansensu)
*   **Themes:** Jealousy, Infidelity, Post-prison life, Meiji history, Domestic violence, Poverty.
*   **Flags:** Contains descriptions of domestic abuse and violence against women.
