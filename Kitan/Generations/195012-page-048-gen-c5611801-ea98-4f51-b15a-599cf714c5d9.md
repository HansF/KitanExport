## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

握つたまま、女の手を引寄せようとした。
そのとき、パッと場内が明るくなつた。
ニュースが終つた。
私は、仕方なしに手を離した。
難したけれど、私は、女をもう他人と思われないような気がするので、どんな顔をしているかと振り向くと、きまり悪そうな顔をして俯向いているのが初々しくて、とてもたまらぬ程美しくみえた。
こんど暗くなつたら要領を得るだけのことにしておかねばならぬと、次の映写を待つていると、女が立つて出て行つた。
便所へ行くのだろうと思い、後姿を見送つていると、便所の方へ行かずに出口の方へ行くので、こりやじつとしていられないと、大慌てに立上つて、出口の方へ行くと、女は、もう外へ出かつている。
階段を二階づつ飛び降りて大急ぎで表へ飛び出したが、人混の中だから女の姿がもうみえない。
こいつは困つたと思つて、人を押し分け、ムキになつて探し廻り、花遊小路の角まで来たら、四條通りへ抜けて行く後姿がチラッと眼に入つた。
しめたと思つて、駈足で追いつき、声をかけようとしたが、人通りが多い所では女が迷惑するだろうと、わざと接近しないで、一定の距離を保つて歩いた。
それでも、見失つては大変だと思つて、少しでも距離が遠くなると、人中を駈出したりしていた。
女は、澄したもので、後も振り向かずに、四條大橋を渡り、京阪電車の停留場へ入つて切符を買つている。何処まで買うか聞き落しては大変と、傍へ飛んでゆくと、女が振り向いた。ぱつたり眼が合つた。
きつと笑顔を見せるであろうと改つていたのに、私の姿をみた女はサツと顔の色を変えると、くるりと背をみせて、改札口へ向つて歩いてゆく。
少し当がはずれた気がしないではなかつたが、処女としては恥しくて、そうした素振をみせるのだろうと思つて大して気にもとめなかつた。
とにかく、丹波橋まで切符を買つて改札を出ると、やがて電車がきた。
満員で掛けるところがないので、女と少し離れた所で吊り皮にぶらさがり様子を窺つてみたが、女は私に背中を向けて、いつこう振り向こうともしない。
夕日の落ちた加茂川面から涼しい風が吹きこんできて、女のほつれ毛をなぶつていた。
私は、その後姿を、うつとり眺めていろいろな空想を描いていた。
これから、どつかで降りたら、すぐ声をかけようか、それとも、どこへ行くか、ゆく所まで黙つてついて行つてみようか、そして、声をかけたら、どんな返事をするかしら、返事の模様によつては、話がどう発展するかも知れない。そうなつたらどうしよう――。
そんなことを、それからそれへと繰返しているうちに、丹波橋へ着いた。
乗り越してもいいや、と思つていたら、案の定、女が降りた。
改札を出ると、もう薄暗かつたが、人通りが少なかつたから、見失う様なことはないと思い、少し離れて女の後をつけてゆくと、急に、薄暗い路地へ折れ曲つた。
片側は板塀、声をかけるなら今だと思つて、女の傍へ寄ると、気配でそれと知つた女は、こちらを振向いた。
その顔つきが、いかにも気重いので口まで出かけた声が内訌して、私は唾を飲んだ。まごついているうちに、女はだん／＼向うへ歩いて行く。これではならぬと、女の後をまたつけて行く、と、女は、足を速め、私が時々駈出さねば追いつけないほど速く歩いてゆく。しかし、ここまでついてきて、このまま別れてしまうのは、何といっても甲斐性のないことだから、せめて住所だけなりと知つておきたいと思つて、接近した時には声をかけようとするのであつたが、映画館でみたときは、まるで別人の様な、険のある眼つきで睨まれるので、いおうと思つていたこともいい出せなかつた。
女は、私にひとことも、ものをいわせないようにして、行き過ぎようとするのだが、もう、こうなれば、私も意地みたいになつてどこまでも追つかけてゆくと、人家の切れた田圃道へ出た。
ここまでくれば、全く人通りがないし、歩いているのは、女と私の二人きり、日はとつぷり暮れて、どんなことをいつたつて安心だ。そう思うと勇気百倍して女の近くへ寄り添い
「もし／＼」
と大胆に呼び止めた。
ところが、聞えないのか、女は知らん振りして行き過ぎようとするから私は駈出して行つて、躰すれ／＼にまで寄り添い
「ちよつと待つて下さい」
今度は、大きな声で叫んだ。
こうなると、女も黙つて行く訳にも行かぬとみえて、そこへ立止ると、私の方へ向き直つたが、矢張り険しい眼つきをしている。
「あなたに少し話したいことがある」
凄いような眼でみつめられるのが、なんとなく気味が悪かつたけれど、今となつて尻ごみすることもできぬから、思つていることをいおうとした時、
「執念深い人だね、話したいことがある
(49)

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

While holding, the woman's hand I tried to pull closer. At that time, suddenly the inside of the hall became bright. The news finished. I, without choice, released the hand. Released though, I, the woman already another person do not think feeling because I do, what kind of face doing whether as for when turn around, embarrassed-seeming face doing looking down being is innocent, very unbearable degree beautifully seemed. Next time when becomes dark getting the knack only thing do must do and, next projection waiting when, the woman stood up went out. Toilet to going probably thinking, back figure seeing off when, toilet's direction to without going exit's direction to going because, this still cannot be and, in great hurry stood up, exit's direction to go when, the woman, already outside go-about-to-be.

Stairs two floors at a time jumping down in great haste outside jumped out but, crowd's middle because is woman's figure already cannot see. This is troubled thinking, people pushing aside, in earnest searching around, Kayu-koji corner until came when, Shijo-dori toward passing through going back figure "glance" eye into entered. "Got it" thinking, running pace with caught up, voice try to call but, pedestrian traffic many place in is woman trouble will probably and, purposely not approaching, certain distance maintaining walked. Even so, losing sight of is terrible thinking, even a little distance far becomes when, people middle ran out was doing.

Woman, composed thing, back also without turning around, Shijo Ohashi crossing, Keihan electric train stop into entering ticket buying is. To where until buy miss-hearing is terrible and, side to fly-go when, woman turned around. "Suddenly" eyes met. Surely smiling face will show likely corrected-myself was although, my figure saw woman "quickly" face color change when, "spin" back show, ticket gate toward walking goes. A little expectation missed feeling did not not was but, as a virgin/maiden is shy, such behavior showing probably thinking much care also did not stop. Anyway, Tanbabashi until ticket buying ticket gate exit when, eventually train came.

Full-capacity because sitting place is not because, woman and a little distant place in strap to hanging state-of-affairs peeked tried but, woman to me back turning, at all turn-around try even does not. Sunset fallen Kamo River surface from cool wind blowing in come, woman's loose hair was teasing. I, that back figure, entranced gazing various fantasies drawing was. From now, somewhere exit if, immediately voice shall call whether, or, where to go whether, going place until silently follow go try whether, and, voice call if, what kind of reply do I wonder, reply's appearance according to, talk how develop also not known. That becomes if what shall I do—. Such things, that from that to repeating during, Tanbabashi to arrived. Ride-past okay, was thinking when, as expected, woman got off.

Ticket gate exit when, already dim was but, pedestrian traffic small was because, lose sight of such thing is not thinking, a little distant woman's back following go when, suddenly, dim alley to turned. One side is wooden fence, voice call if now is thinking, woman's side to approach when, presence by that knew woman, this way turned around. That expression, indeed heavy-hearted because mouth to out-about-to voice internal-attacked, I saliva swallowed. Fumbling during, woman gradually over there toward walking goes. This for is not and, woman's back again following go, then, woman, feet speed-up, I sometimes must-run-out degree fast walking goes. However, until here following come, this as separate end is, what say even lack-of-resourcefulness thing because, at least address only even want to know thinking, approached time in voice call to was doing but, movie theater in saw time is, completely different person like, sharp/thorny eye-expression with glared because, say was thinking thing also say-out could not.

Woman, to me one word also, thing not-say-as, pass-by-try is although, already, this becomes if, I also stubbornness-like become everywhere chasing go when, houses ended rice-field-road to came out. To here come if, completely pedestrian traffic is not and, walking is, woman and me two-people only, sun completely set, what kind of thing say even safe. So think when courage hundred-fold woman's near to draw-close "Moshi moshi" and boldly called-stop. However, hear-cannot whether, woman knowing-not-pretend pass-by-try because I run-out go, body-barely-touching until draw-close "A little wait please" this time, loud voice with shouted. This becomes when, woman also silently go reason also go-not seems, there to stop when, me's direction to turned-back but, as-expected sharp eye-expression doing is. "To you a little want to talk thing exists" terrible-like eyes with stared-at being is, somehow creepy was although, now become retreat thing also cannot because, thinking thing say-try time, "Persistent person indeed, want to talk thing exists..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Still clutching her hand, I tried to pull her closer to me. Just then, the lights in the theater flared on. The newsreel had ended. Reluctantly, I let go. Though I had released her, I felt as if she were no longer a stranger. When I turned to see her face, she was looking down with an air of bashful awkwardness. There was a guileless innocence about her that made her appear unbearably beautiful. I told myself that when the lights dimmed again, I would have to be more decisive. But as I waited for the next screening to begin, she stood up and walked out.

Thinking she was simply heading to the restroom, I watched her go. But when she bypassed the restroom and headed straight for the exit, I realized I couldn't just sit there. I scrambled to my feet in a panic. By the time I reached the exit, she was already stepping outside. I leaped down the stairs two at a time and burst out onto the street, but the sidewalk was teeming with people, and she was nowhere to be seen. Distraught, I began pushing through the crowd, searching frantically. It was only when I reached the corner of Kayu-koji that I caught a fleeting glimpse of her back, heading toward Shijo-dori.

"Got her," I thought. I broke into a trot to catch up. I wanted to call out to her, but fearing she might be embarrassed in such a crowded place, I kept my distance and followed behind. Still, terrified of losing her again, I would find myself sprinting through gaps in the crowd whenever the distance between us grew too wide.

She remained perfectly composed, never once looking back. She crossed the Shijo Bridge and entered the Keihan station to buy a ticket. Terrified that I might miss her destination, I hurried to her side just as she turned around. Our eyes met squarely. I had braced myself for a smile, but the moment she saw me, her expression hardened. She turned her back on me and walked toward the ticket gate. I felt a pang of disappointment, but I brushed it off, assuming her behavior was merely the natural shyness of a young maiden.

I bought a ticket for Tanbabashi and passed through the gate. Soon, the train arrived. It was packed, with no seats available, so I stood a short distance away, clinging to a strap and stealing glances at her. She kept her back to me the entire time, never once turning around. A cool breeze blew in from the Kamo River as the sun began to set, teasing the loose strands of her hair. I gazed at her from behind, lost in a trance, my mind spinning with fantasies. Should I speak to her the moment she gets off? Or should I follow her all the way to her destination? If I do speak to her, how will she respond? Depending on her reaction, who knows how things might develop? And if they do... what then?

Lost in these circular thoughts, we arrived at Tanbabashi. I was prepared to ride past my stop if necessary, but as I expected, she got off. Outside the gate, the world was growing dim. Since there were few people around, I felt confident I wouldn't lose her. I followed at a distance, until she suddenly turned into a dark alley. It was lined on one side with a wooden fence. Thinking this was my chance, I drew near. Sensing my presence, she turned toward me. Her expression was so heavy and burdened that the words died in my throat, and I could only swallow hard. While I hesitated, she began to walk away. I couldn't let it end like this, so I followed again. She quickened her pace—so fast that I had to break into a run just to keep up. After coming this far, it would be pathetic to simply walk away. I wanted to at least know where she lived. Every time I got close enough to speak, I remembered the sharp, piercing glare she had given me in the theater—so different from the girl I first saw—and the words failed me.

She seemed determined not to let me say a single word, hurrying past as if to escape. But I had grown stubborn. I pursued her until the houses thinned out and we reached a path through the open rice fields. Out here, there wasn't a soul in sight. It was just the two of us under the fallen cloak of night. I felt a surge of boldness, knowing I could say anything now without fear of being overheard. My courage bolstered, I drew close to her side.

"Excuse me," I said, calling out boldly.

She acted as if she hadn't heard me and tried to push past. I ran ahead and drew so close our bodies almost touched.

"Wait a moment, please!" I shouted.

Seeing that she could no longer ignore me, she stopped in her tracks and turned. Her eyes were as sharp and cold as before.

"I have something I want to tell you," I said. Being pinned by that terrifying gaze was unnerving, but I had come too far to back down now. Just as I was about to pour out my heart, she spoke.

"You certainly are persistent, aren't you? So, you have something to tell me..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese vertical layout (*tate-gaki*), common in literary magazines. It is divided into two main columns of text.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface typical of mid-20th-century printing. It uses *kyujitai* (older kanji forms) occasionally, though many are standardized. 
*   **Visual Elements:** At the bottom of the page, there is a line-art illustration depicting the two characters. The man wears a suit and a fedora, typical of urban male fashion in the early to mid-Showa era. The woman wears a kimono, suggesting a blend of modern and traditional styles. The landscape in the background shows a path by a fence, matching the "rice-field path" and "wooden fence" mentioned in the text.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "(49)" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger serialized story or a collection.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses the "dash" (——) for internal monologue/trailing thoughts and specific repetition marks (だん／＼ for *dandan*).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Showa Period):** The mention of a "newsreel" (*news*) at a cinema is a strong indicator of the 1930s-1950s. Before television became common, newsreels were the primary way people saw visual news.
*   **Geography (Kyoto):** The story tracks a specific route in Kyoto:
    *   **Hanakayu-koji (花遊小路):** A narrow, historic alley near Shijo-Kawaramachi.
    *   **Shijo-dori (四條通り):** The main east-west commercial artery of Kyoto.
    *   **Shijo Ohashi (四條大橋):** The bridge over the Kamo River.
    *   **Keihan Electric Railway (京阪電車):** The line connecting Kyoto and Osaka.
    *   **Tanbabashi (丹波橋):** A station in Fushimi, Kyoto, which was less developed and more "rural" (rice fields) in the mid-20th century than it is today.
*   **Social Convention:** The narrator’s behavior—following a woman from a theater onto a train and into a dark alley—is framed as a romantic or obsessive pursuit. In the context of mid-century "I-novels" (*watakushi shosetsu*), this type of voyeuristic obsession was a common literary trope used to explore the narrator's psyche, though today it reads clearly as stalking.
*   **Terminology:** The term "処女" (*shojo*) is used here not just to mean "virgin" but to characterize her as a "young, respectable, unmarried maiden" who would naturally be "shy" around men.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **初々しくて (Ui-uishikute):** Innocent, naive, or fresh. The narrator projects this quality onto the woman to justify his attraction.
*   **澄ましたもので (Sumashita mono de):** Acting composed, unperturbed, or "putting on airs." 
*   **甲斐性のない (Kaisho no nai):** Lacking spirit, resourcefulness, or worth. The narrator feels that giving up would make him a "worthless" man.
*   **内訌 (Naiko):** Usually means internal strife or domestic conflict. Here, it’s used metaphorically to describe his voice "collapsing inward" or failing to come out due to nerves.
*   **勇気百倍 (Yuki Hyakubai):** "Courage increased a hundredfold." A common idiom for a sudden surge of bravery.
*   **執念深い (Shunen-bukai):** Persistent, tenacious, or spiteful. It carries a negative connotation of being obsessive or refusing to let go of a grudge/desire.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Obsession and the Male Gaze:** The narrative is entirely driven by the protagonist's one-sided projection and pursuit. He interprets her silence as "shyness" and her glares as a challenge to his "stubbornness."
*   **Urban Solitude vs. Rural Isolation:** The story moves from a crowded theater and busy Kyoto streets to a desolate rice-field path. This transition heightens the tension and shifts the power dynamic from the public sphere (where she can ignore him) to a private, potentially dangerous space.
*   **Misinterpretation:** A central theme is the gap between the narrator's "fantasies" (*kusō*) and the reality of the woman's reaction. He expects a smile or a romantic development, but receives "terrible eyes" and a rebuke of being "persistent."
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The text explores the predatory nature of "streetwalking" or "following" (*biko*) which was a recurring element in Japanese naturalist and "I-novel" literature, often portraying the male protagonist's social awkwardness as a source of dark literary tension.

---
