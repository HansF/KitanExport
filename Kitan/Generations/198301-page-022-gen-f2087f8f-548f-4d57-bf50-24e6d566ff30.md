## Literal English Translation

Even if something originates from a person, if it is my fault, one should not attribute it to oneself and return it [to the self].
If there is something unavoidable, even if that originates from the heart, one should yield it to others, it is said.

○ Fierce/Brave (たけく), not being like that, and desiring to destroy. This thing, even regarding a younger sister/lover (妹), is not hated, as it is written in old texts.
Perhaps, by being pitiful, one is not strong. Not being strong must be the heart of a woman (女の心).
My Lord, do you not see? Teeth (hard) fall out and spoil quickly due to their hardness. But the tongue (soft) is always soft, so it never spoils until the body ends.
Ancient people, too, held up the teeth and the tongue to caution against the violently fierce heart of man.

○ A person called a good friend (仲よし) is infinitely praised because they take joy in hearing of the faults that are in my own body.
Modern people, however, if they have faults, do not rejoice in correcting them, but dislike it, like a sick person hating medicine. This is a saying of Lord Shu Shi (Zhou Dunyi).
Those who criticize me become my enemies. Who knows what a good teaching this is?

○ When employing people, one must know the affection (mercy) one has and how to utilize them well.
It is extremely rare to find good people who go everywhere, persisting without complaint.
Moreover, if the end is darker than the beginning of the road, one must especially see that there are no major defects (たほたぬ事). If one clearly understands this principle, one should forgive minor matters.
A man named Tao Yuanming, in a letter giving a servant to his child, wrote, "You exert yourself in evening labor." If [the servant] helps by driving the cart, collecting firewood, and drawing water, give this servant [to him].

## Literary English Translation

Even if a failing originates from oneself, one should not claim ownership of that mistake. If there is an unavoidable consequence, even if born from the heart, it is better to deflect it onto others, so the wisdom states.

○ The inclination to be fierce, to avoid restraint, and to desire breaking things—this tendency, which is not detested even when directed towards a younger woman or lover (妹), is found in ancient texts.
Perhaps, by being pitiful, one sacrifices strength. Indeed, lacking strength must be the essence of the feminine heart.
Do you observe, Lord? The teeth, being hard, decay quickly and are soon lost. But the tongue, being eternally soft, suffers no damage until the body itself perishes.
The ancients used the analogy of the teeth and the tongue to caution against the violently fierce nature of the human heart.

○ A true friend is one who earns boundless praise precisely because they delight in hearing about the errors of your own self.
The people of today, however, if confronted with their own mistakes, do not rejoice in the opportunity for correction. They despise it, like a sick person who rejects medicine. These are the words of Lord Shu Shi (Zhou Dunyi).
Those who criticize me become my adversaries. But who truly understands that this is the best form of instruction?

○ When managing employees or subordinates, one must possess compassion and understand how to properly cultivate their service.
It is rare indeed to find good workers who never complain, no matter where they are sent or what task they undertake.
Furthermore, if their later actions prove darker than their early performance, one must ensure they are free from major, insurmountable flaws. If one grasps this truth, then small matters should be forgiven.
The poet Tao Yuanming, when dispatching a servant to his son, wrote in the accompanying letter, "If he applies himself to the evening’s labor—that is, if he aids in driving the cart, collecting wood, and drawing water—you may accept this servant."

## Structural & Editorial Analysis

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Section Type** | *Zuihitsu* (Miscellany / Philosophical Essay) or Editorial Commentary. The use of `○` separates distinct, unrelated moral observations. |
| **Author Attribution** | Implicitly the editor or a regular columnist, using a formal, classical, and pedagogical tone. No explicit author name is present. |
| **Voice** | Formal, scholarly, moralistic, and slightly archaic (employing historical kana and complex syntax). The voice shifts between philosophical generalization ("Ancient people...") and direct address ("My Lord, do you not see?"). |
| **Target Audience** | Literate, intellectually curious readership of *Kitan Club* seeking justification and context for modern behavioral issues using classical authority. Appeals to both intellectual curiosity and conservative social norms. |
| **Tone** | Didactic, authoritative, and reflective, with sudden shifts to discussing gender and power dynamics. |
| **Contextual References** | References the Chinese philosopher Zhou Dunyi (周子, often Shu Shi in older texts) and the poet Tao Yuanming (陶淵明). This elevates the text beyond simple pulp commentary. |
| **Positioning** | Likely part of a recurring column offering commentary on social/sexual ethics, perhaps bridging classical Asian morality with the contemporary anxieties of the Showa era. |

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

1.  **Classical Morality in Showa Magazines:** The heavy reliance on Zhou Dunyi (11th-century Neo-Confucian philosopher) and Tao Yuanming (4th-century poet) is a common trope in mid-century Japanese intellectual discourse. Even in ero-guro magazines, citing classical authority lent gravitas to discussions of social order, hierarchy, and moral failings.
2.  **Gender Roles and Strength (女の心):** The core metaphor of the teeth (hard, fierce, brittle, temporary) versus the tongue (soft, yielding, lasting, feminine) reinforces a traditional ideal of female virtue (*onna no kokoro*). The text explicitly links softness and weakness to the feminine nature, contrasting it with the destructive "fierce heart" of man (*takekuゝしき心*). This is a classical trope repurposed to comment on Showa-era gender expectations, likely reinforcing the idea that women must endure or submit (be soft like the tongue) to thrive in a patriarchal society.
3.  **The Term *Imōto* (妹):** While literally "younger sister," in older texts and the context of ero-guro, *imōto* (妹) often functions as a euphemism for a young lover, mistress, or sexual object, implying youth, availability, and a degree of power imbalance.
4.  **"Modern People" (今やうの人):** This is a key phrase used by conservative commentators (even in avant-garde magazines) to lament perceived moral decay and the loss of traditional virtues, specifically the inability to accept constructive criticism, contrasting them with the ideal of the "true friend" who corrects faults.
5.  **Subordination and Compassion (*Ninjō* / 情け):** The final section, discussing the management of *genin* (下人, servants/subordinates), stresses the necessity of *nasake* (affection or compassion) in authority. This reflects a persistent societal structure where hierarchy remains firm, but the ideal Confucian ruler/manager tempers power with clemency, especially regarding minor faults, referencing Tao Yuanming's known humility and respect for labor.

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

1.  **Gendered Power Dynamics:** The central thematic tension lies in contrasting fierce masculine energy (*takeku*) with soft feminine endurance (*onna no kokoro*). The text legitimizes the fierce nature of man (by claiming it is recorded in ancient texts) but cautions against its destructive excess via the tongue/teeth metaphor. The underlying implication is that the feminine strategy (softness, endurance) is necessary for survival in a world defined by masculine hardness and potential violence.
2.  **Authority and Control:** The essay is deeply concerned with the maintenance of social and personal control. This is seen in the advice on deflecting blame, the critique of modern failure to accept correction, and the detailed instruction on managing subordinates. The implicit anxiety is the breakdown of traditional authority in the turbulent postwar/mid-Showa environment.
3.  **Intellectual Voyeurism:** By packaging moral philosophy (Confucian ethics) with subtle commentary on sexual/gender traits (fierceness toward the *imōto*), the text allows the reader to engage in a seemingly scholarly reflection on control and sexuality, typical of *Kitan Club*'s style of intellectualizing taboo subjects.
4.  **The Value of Submission:** Both the gender metaphor and the instruction on managing servants suggest that the highest virtue for the subordinate (woman, servant) is compliant endurance and adaptability.

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual content:** Moderate (Implied power dynamics, specific reference to *imōto* in a context of "fierceness").
*   **Violence:** Suggested (The "violently fierce heart" of man; "desiring to destroy").
*   **Coercion:** Suggested (Power imbalance between master/servant and man/woman).
*   **Medical / bodily themes:** Explicit (Teeth falling out, illness, medicine).
*   **Taboo or illegal implications:** Low (Primarily philosophical, though the discussion of fierce aggression toward a younger woman touches on potentially darker themes).
