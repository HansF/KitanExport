## Normalized Japanese (現代仮名遣い)

主君と想い、慎みつつ、敬うことを怠り、志が深いからといって、深く恥ずかしながら、初めから違えてばかりいる。

それが、己を許しとなり、自ら顧みて己を責めるべきである。これが善き御業をしたならば、必ず、岩木ならず、このようにすることは久遠なるものとなる。我が万事尽くしたならば、人の悪さがあるからこそ我が悪さとなる。徒にのみ他人を辛い（苦しい）と思うのは、何か心の中で我が身を疎(うと)んじるものとするからか。

これみな聖の御業にしか倣ったるなり。つくよみ深くも思い、我、故郷に有る歌を童たちが歌うとき、我より優るべき人ならば、我より優るる道を踏み破るべき人ならば、我また直ぐに学ぶな。向こうの過ちを学ぶな。

（別段落）

○人は我に依らず、我は無体な人をして溢るるをぞ、敬うことに、ひと我を直すとし、時我よりの世の人みな知るもあれ、たとえ人はともあれかくもあれ、我は慕い敬い倣うべき人ならんか、とき人よりの例を、我より優るべき人ならば、我より優るる道を踏み破るべき人ならば、我また直ぐに学ぶな。

よしや、人ら邪淫(よこしま)は、向こうの過ちを学ぶなじ。

## Literal English Translation

Thinking of the Lord (or Master), while cautious, I am neglectful of reverence, and though my intention is deep, I am deeply ashamed; since the beginning I have only been deviating.

That becomes the allowance of the self; one must reflect upon oneself and blame oneself. If one performs this good deed, it will inevitably become an eternal thing, not merely rock or wood. If I have exhausted all things (done my utmost), then it is because there is wickedness in others that my own wickedness exists. Is it only in vain that I feel others are harsh? Is it because I treat my own heart as something contemptible?

All this is merely imitation of the deeds of the Sages. Even Tsukuyomi thought deeply: when the children sing the songs existing in my hometown, should there be a person who should surpass me, should there be a person who should break the path of my superiority, then I vow not to quickly learn (from them). Do not learn the faults of the opposite side.

(Section break)

O, people do not rely on me, but I am an unruly person letting things overflow, and in reverence, one person corrects me, and then everyone in the world knows about my time (era). Even if others are thus or thus, should I be a person who should admire, revere, and imitate them? If they are people who should surpass me, if they are people who should break the path of my superiority, I vow not to quickly learn (from them).

Well then, let others be [sexually] wicked—I vow not to learn the faults of the opposite side.

## Literary English Translation

I consider the Master, cautious and mindful, yet I am negligent in my reverence. I tell myself my intent is profound, but deep shame attends me, for I have only strayed since the very first moment.

This deviation becomes my self-absolution. I must examine myself and deliver my own judgment. If I accomplish this good work, it will endure eternally, not like ephemeral things of rock and wood. If I have done my utmost, then my own depravity is merely a consequence of the depravity I see in others. Why do I find others so needlessly cruel? Is it perhaps because I treat my own heart as a thing of slight regard?

All this is simply an imitation of the Sages’ conduct. Even Tsukuyomi considered this deeply: when the children sing the ancestral songs of my home, should there be a person who ought to excel me—a person who ought to destroy the very path of my superiority—I swear I shall not quickly learn to follow them. Do not acquire the failings of the opposition.

(Section break)

O, people do not rely on me, for I am a lawless man, allowing my nature to run rampant. In my performance of reverence, one person corrects me, and suddenly everyone in the world knows of my state. Though others may be thus or so, am I to be a person who admires, reveres, and emulates them? If they are a person who should surpass me, if they are a person who should destroy the path of my superiority, I swear I shall not quickly learn from them.

Very well, let others commit their wicked acts (adultery)—I swear I shall not acquire the failings of the opposite side.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Philosophical Essay, Literary Zuihitsu (Musing), or the internal monologue/confession of a short story character. The intense moral focus suggests literary fiction or a highly stylized reader letter/editorial segment. |
| **Author Attribution** | Unattributed (no name visible). |
| **Editorial Voice** | Narrative voice is highly personal, self-critical, and defensive, using complex, archaic syntax; definitively not an objective editorial voice. |
| **Target Audience** | Highly literate readers interested in moral philosophy, self-justification, and the intellectualization of transgression (common *Kitan Club* demographic). |
| **Stylistic Markers** | Extensive use of *rekishiteki kanazukai* (historical kana usage) and complex furigana. The text relies heavily on antithesis (Self vs. Others; Sages vs. Modernity). |
| **Positioning** | Page 19. The ornate bird vignette in the upper left suggests a section break or the beginning/end of a short, intense piece. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Mid-Showa Literary Style:** The ornate syntax and reliance on historical kana mark this text as written in a high literary style popular in the 1930s-1950s, linking traditional aesthetics with modernist psychological depth.
*   **The Master/Lord (主君, Shukun):** The term evokes feudal loyalty, but here it might be metaphorical, representing a cultural ideal, mentor, or even a dominant sexual partner (in the context of *Kitan Club* BDSM themes), suggesting a failure to live up to a high standard of submission or dedication.
*   **Sages (聖, Hijiri):** References to traditional moral exemplars (Confucian, Buddhist, or ancient Japanese poets/thinkers) set up the classic modernist conflict: how can the individual maintain integrity when traditional moral frameworks (the Sages) clash with modern psychological reality and desire?
*   **Tsukuyomi (つくよみ):** The Moon God. Invoking a high-ranking deity in a personal philosophical crisis is a form of spiritual grounding, suggesting the narrator believes their dilemma has cosmic significance.
*   **Moral Relativism (My Wickedness vs. Others'):** The narrator attempts to justify personal "wickedness" (わろさ) by arguing it is a consequence of external societal corruption (the other's wickedness). This is a common defense mechanism in texts exploring *ero-guro* themes, where the grotesque behavior is presented as a mirror reflecting a degenerate society.
*   **姦 (よこしまひ - Yokoshimahi):** The concluding phrase clearly introduces sexual transgression (*jain* or adultery/lewdness) as the ultimate "fault of the opposing side" that the narrator must *not* learn, even while allowing others to commit it. This sharp turn anchors the abstract moral debate squarely in the realm of erotic taboos.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Furigana) | Standard Meaning | Nuance / Ero-Guro Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **おこた（り）** (怠り) | Neglect; failure. | Failure in duty, possibly duty to one's Master (sexual or moral). |
| **ふかみずかし** (深みずかし) | Deeply ashamed; having great scruples. | High literary marker for acute moral distress/inner conflict. |
| **久遠** (くをん) | Eternity; permanence. | Contrasted with the fleeting, shameful acts of the present. |
| **無体な人** (むたいなひと) | Lawless, rough, brutish person. | A self-description implying defiance of social norms. |
| **つらし** (辛し) | Hard; cruel; painful. | Used to describe the oppressive judgment felt from others. |
| **うと（す）** (疎し) | To treat lightly, contemptuously. | The self-contempt that fuels the narrator's actions. |
| **わろさ** (悪さ) | Badness; wickedness. | A deliberately simple term for sin, used in a complex philosophical argument. |
| **よこしまひは** (邪淫/姦) | Adultery; lewdness; sexual misconduct. | The definitive taboo act cited in the conclusion, providing the context for the "faults of the opposing side." |
| **むかふのあし** (向かふの過ち) | The mistake/fault of the opposite side/adversary. | The specific moral flaw the narrator vows to avoid learning, despite his own general wickedness. |

---

## Themes & Subtext

*   **The Superiority of Non-Conformity:** The narrator rejects imitating those who "surpass" him or "break his path," suggesting that his true superiority lies in maintaining a unique, self-determined moral path—even if that path is defined by recognized "wickedness."
*   **Intellectualized Transgression:** The entire text is a sophisticated, classicist defense of internal chaos. The narrator takes responsibility ("I must blame myself") only to immediately deflect blame outward ("my wickedness exists because of others'"). This intellectual cycle justifies continued moral deviation.
*   **Psychological Sadism/Masochism:** The insistence on self-blame ("責むべし") coupled with the rejection of external correction suggests a psychological state where moral anguish is sought out or cultivated as a form of painful pleasure or spiritual purification—a common undercurrent in ero-guro literature exploring power over the self.
*   **Erotic Anxiety:** The abrupt conclusion, focusing on avoiding the "faults" of adultery/lewdness (*yokoshimahi*), implies that while the narrator defends their general "unruly" nature, there is a specific line (likely sexual) that they intellectually or morally draw, making the entire preceding argument a tense meditation on how close they are to crossing it.
