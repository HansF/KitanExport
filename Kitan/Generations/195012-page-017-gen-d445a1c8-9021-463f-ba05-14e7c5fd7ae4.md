新婚夫婦の寝物語から

お化け屋敷の睦言
兵庫 一二三

「ねえ、あなたッ」
例によつて艶子が甘つたるい声を出す。
「うん……」
「もう、そろそろ、お炬燵がほしくなるわね」
「うん」
「あたし、足が冷たいわ……ねえ、あなたッてば」
「……」
「うん」
「あなたの足、いつでも暖かいわ、あなたは情熱家なのよ……」
「うん」
艶子は幸福そうに天井裏をちつと見つめながら、
「いゝ、お家がみつかつてよかつたわね」
「うん」
「まるで、このお家、あたしたちの結婚を待つていてくれたようなものね。ほんとにいゝお家だわ、一戸建で、大きな声をあげても、お隣へは聞えないし、いゝわね、あなた、そう思わない？」
「うん」
「結婚して、義兄さんたちの狭いお家へ同居するなんて、みじめだつたわ、ほんとによかつたわ。こんないいお家がみつかつて……難を言えば、鉄道線路の近いだけが欠点、でも、これも、馴れればリズムのように思えるわ、あたしたちにこんないいお家が与えられるなんて、奇蹟よ、うれしいわ、あなたうれしくない？」
「うん」
「これは、あなたが敏腕家だからよ。あたしどうして、こんな幸福をつかんだのでしょう……あたし、あなたを信頼してるのよ、寂しがらせず、悲しませず、あなたお願いするわ、」
「うん」
「頼りないのね、なにを言つても、うんうんて、どうなさつたの――」
艶子の饒舌はつづく、
「艶子、そう僕の躰を揺るなよ、僕は疲れているんだ」
「あら、まあ、あなたは結婚前にどんなことをおつしやつたか覚えていらつしやる。会社で疲れて帰つても艶子さんの顔を見りゃ、疲れなんか一ぺんにけし飛んでしまうつて……あれ、嘘だつたの……」
「嘘ぢやないよ……」
「ぢゃあ、元気を出してちょうだい。ねえ、あなた、電燈が明るいんでしょう、暗くしましょうか」
「暗くするのは待つてくれ」
「変ね、どうかしていらつしゃるわ……あたし一日中、一人でお留守していて寂しいのよ、あなたのお帰りをどんなにお待ちしているか、あなたにはお判りにならないのね」
「判つている……艶子、汽車が通つているね」
「そりゃ線路が近くだもの……」
「何時だろう？」
「十時？、いよいよ、近づいてきたね……」
「あなた、それ、なにのこと……今晩のあなた変ね、すつかりおつきがないわ、疲れたと言つていながら大きな目を開けて、ときどきむつくり起き上つたりして、ますます変だわ……夜は艶子の愛情に思いつきり、おぼれるんだとおつしやつていらしたのに……あたし失望するわ、なんかあるの……」

From the Bedtime Stories of Newlywed Couples

Pillow Talk of the Haunted House
By Hyogo Hifumi

"Hey, dear,"
As usual, Tsuyako lets out a sugary-sweet voice.
"Yeah..."
"It's about time we started wanting a kotatsu, isn't it?"
"Yeah."
"My feet are cold... Hey, I'm talking to you."
"..."
"Yeah."
"Your feet are always warm; you're a passionate person..."
"Yeah."
Tsuyako, while looking up at the ceiling looking happy, says:
"It was good that a nice house was found, wasn't it?"
"Yeah."
"It's almost as if this house was waiting for our marriage. It really is a good house; it's a detached house, so even if we raise our voices loud, it won't be heard by the neighbors. It's nice, isn't it, dear? Don't you think so?"
"Yeah."
"After getting married, living together in your brother-in-law's narrow house was miserable. It's truly good. To find such a good house... if I were to say a flaw, the proximity to the railroad tracks is the only drawback, but even this, once we get used to it, will seem like a rhythm. For such a good house to be given to us is a miracle. I'm happy; aren't you happy?"
"Yeah."
"This is because you are a capable man. I wonder how I grabbed such happiness... I trust you. Don't make me lonely, don't make me sad, I'm asking you, dear."
"Yeah."
"You're unreliable, no matter what I say, you just say 'yeah, yeah.' What's the matter with you—"
Tsuyako's talkativeness continues.
"Tsuyako, don't shake my body like that, I am tired."
"Oh, my. Do you remember what kind of things you said before marriage? Even if you come home tired from the company, if you see Tsuyako-san's face, the tiredness will fly away all at once... Was that a lie?"
"It wasn't a lie..."
"Then, please cheer up. Hey, dear, the electric light is too bright, isn't it? Shall we make it dark?"
"Wait on making it dark."
"Strange, you're acting somehow off... I'm home alone all day long and lonely. How much I wait for your return, you don't understand, do you?"
"I understand... Tsuyako, a train is passing, isn't it?"
"That's because the tracks are nearby..."
"What time is it?"
"Ten? Finally, it's getting closer..."
"Dear, that, what do you mean? You're strange tonight; you have no composure at all. While saying you're tired, you keep your eyes wide open and sometimes suddenly sit up; it's getting stranger... You said that at night you would drown yourself completely in Tsuyako's affection... I'm disappointed. Is there something [wrong]?"

**From "Newlywed Pillow Talk"**

**Pillow Talk in a Haunted House**
By Hyogo Hifumi

"Hey, darling..." Tsuyako's voice was, as usual, syrupy and sweet.

"Mmm..."

"It’s getting to be that time of year when we’ll want a kotatsu, don’t you think?"

"Mmm."

"My feet are so cold... Hey, are you listening?"

"..."

"Mmm."

"Your feet are always so warm. You really are the passionate type, aren't you?"

"Mmm."

Tsuyako gazed happily up at the ceiling. "I'm so glad we found this place, aren't you?"

"Mmm."

"It’s almost as if this house was waiting for us to get married. It’s such a lovely home. And since it’s a detached house, the neighbors won't hear a thing even if we get... a little loud. Isn’t it wonderful? Don't you agree?"

"Mmm."

"Living with your brother-in-law in that cramped little house after the wedding was just miserable. I’m so relieved. Finding a place like this... well, the only downside is how close the train tracks are, but I’m sure we’ll get used to it. It’ll just be like a rhythm. It’s a miracle we were given such a great house. I’m so happy. Aren’t you?"

"Mmm."

"It’s only because you’re so capable. I don’t know how I got so lucky... I trust you, darling. Please, never let me be lonely or sad."

"Mmm."

"You’re being so vague. No matter what I say, it’s just 'Mmm, mmm.' What’s wrong with you?" Tsuyako’s chatter showed no signs of stopping.

"Tsuyako, don't shake me like that. I told you, I’m exhausted."

"Oh, really? And do you remember what you used to say before we were married? You said that no matter how tired you were from work, one look at Tsuyako’s face and your fatigue would vanish instantly. Was that all a lie?"

"It wasn't a lie..."

"Then cheer up! Look, is the light too bright for you? Shall I turn it off?"

"Wait—don't turn the light off yet."

"You’re acting so strange... I’m here all alone, keeping the house all day, and it’s lonely. You have no idea how much I look forward to you coming home."

"I know... Tsuyako, listen. A train is passing."

"Well, of course it is. The tracks are right there."

"What time is it?"

"Ten? Finally, it’s getting close..."

"Darling, what are you talking about? You’re so odd tonight. You can’t seem to settle down at all. You say you’re tired, yet your eyes are wide open, and you keep bolting upright in bed. You’re acting stranger by the minute. You promised that at night you’d lose yourself in my love... I’m so disappointed. Is something going on?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese magazine format. It uses vertical orientation (tategaki), reading from right to left. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** 
    *   The top-left corner features a decorative frame with the series title: "From the Pillow Talk of a Newlywed Couple" (新婚夫婦の寝物語から).
    *   The main title, "Pillow Talk in a Haunted House" (お化け屋敷の睦言), is written in large, stylized, bold vertical calligraphy on the right side.
    *   The author’s name (Hyogo Hifumi) is at the bottom right in a smaller, boxed-in script.
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing sits in the center-left, depicting a couple lying together in a futon. The woman (Tsuyako) looks animated and talkative, while the man appears tense or preoccupied. The background shows a simple room with a sliding door (fusuma).
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of Kan-ji and Kana. Interestingly, while it mostly uses modern kana (including small 'tsu' and 'yo'), it occasionally uses full-sized 'tsu' (e.g., 待つて) and older punctuation (like the repetition mark いゝ), which suggests a transitional period in Japanese printing (likely late 1940s or 1950s).
*   **Page Marker:** The page number (18) is centered at the bottom in parentheses.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Housing Crisis:** Tsuyako mentions the "misery" of living in a cramped house with her brother-in-law's family. This reflects the severe housing shortages in Japan following WWII, where many families were forced to double up in small spaces. Finding a "detached house" (ippodate) was a significant luxury and a "miracle."
*   **Pillow Talk (睦言/寝物語):** The terms *mutsugoto* and *nemonogatari* refer specifically to the intimate conversations of lovers or spouses in bed. In mid-century Japanese literature, this was a popular sub-genre that allowed for domestic drama or, as hinted here, suspense.
*   **Modern Conveniences:** The mention of "electric lights" (電燈) and "kotatsu" (炬燵) grounds the story in a domestic setting. The husband's reluctance to turn off the light suggests a fear of the dark or what might be lurking there.
*   **Gender Roles:** The dialogue portrays a traditional gender dynamic: the husband works at a "company" (kaisha) and comes home exhausted, while the wife stays home ("keeping the house") and craves emotional connection and attention.
*   **The Train:** In Japanese "ero-guro" (erotic grotesque) or suspense literature of the era, the proximity to railroad tracks often served as a metaphor for industrial intrusion, a source of anxiety, or a mechanical "rhythm" that masks other sounds.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **睦言 (Mutsugoto):** Intimate talk between lovers; sweet nothings. Derived from *mutsumu* (to be harmonious/intimate).
*   **情熱家 (Jounetsuka):** A passionate person. Tsuyako uses this as a playful flirtation because his feet are warm.
*   **敏腕家 (Binwanka):** A person of great ability; a "go-getter" or capable businessman.
*   **饒舌 (Jouzetsu):** Loquacity, talkativeness, or "glibness." It suggests Tsuyako is doing all the talking while her husband is silent.
*   **むっくり (Mukkuri):** Onomatopoeia for suddenly sitting up or rising.
*   **おつきがない (Otsuki ga nai):** A variant of *ochitsuki ga nai* (落ち着きがない), meaning restless, fidgety, or lacking composure.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Domestic Anxiety vs. Marital Bliss:** The wife's dialogue is filled with "happy" buzzwords (miracle, happiness, trust), but the husband's monosyllabic "un" (yeah) and the title's reference to a "haunted house" create a creeping sense of dread.
*   **The Uncanny (The "Haunted House"):** The house is described as perfect—too perfect. It was "waiting" for them. The husband’s behavior suggests he knows something about the house that the wife doesn't. He refuses to turn off the light and is hyper-fixated on the passing train and the time.
*   **Isolation:** The wife prizes the fact that the house is detached and neighbors can't hear them, but in a suspense context, this means no one can hear them if something goes wrong.
*   **Communication Gap:** There is a stark contrast between Tsuyako’s desire for romantic intimacy and the husband’s preoccupation with an external threat (or internal psychological break).

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story), Magazine Serial.
*   **Genre:** Suspense, Mystery, Domestic Drama.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, marriage, haunting, urban legends, gender roles, psychological tension.
