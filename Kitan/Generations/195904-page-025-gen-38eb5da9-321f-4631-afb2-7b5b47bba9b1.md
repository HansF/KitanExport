25　　　　　文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き

『頼朝の顔色はいよいよ不快なものになって行った。……
……（中略）…………
「憎き女性かな。九郎の子をなんとて誇ろうとはする。梶原、そうそうかの女の腹を裂いて子を取り棄てよ。わがためには仇の末たるものを」……（中略）……
「恐れながら」
老練な景時はひと膝すすみ出た。
「前伊予守殿、今は仇とは申しながら、そのお言葉はあまり酷き仰せかと存ぜられます。分娩の後はとも角として今の静どのに手を加えるの儀はお差控えを」
「と申して鎌倉より戻して後に分娩し、これを隠さば、この頼朝の仇を世に送るに等しかるべし」
「されば、分娩いたすまではこの鎌倉にとどめられ、もし生れ出るものが、女性ならばなんの差支えもなきままに帰され、男児たりし折りこそ、兎も角もなし給うが正当と覚え候」
景時の言葉が先ず常識であった。
「左様か」
頼朝は不承（ぶしょう）ぶしょうに短く答えた。』
それにしても頼朝が、「静の腹を裂いて、胎児を引きずり出せ」と言ったのは、単に仇義経の種を宿していたからだけであろうか。嵐を断つだけならば、まだ他にも方法はいくらもある。たとえば、どうせ母子共に殺すならば、静の首を討つなり、毒殺するなりしてもよい筈で、殊更に生体解剖をして恥しめを与える必要はない筈である。それをあえて「腹を截ち割れ」といったのは、何しろ妊娠している日本一の美女。頼朝ならずとも……というのは浅はかな邪推であろうか？

近松門左衛門の「嫩（ふたば）胎内裙（すそ）」はこれを脚色したものであるが、これは生まれた男子は、畠山重忠の情で、助けられることになっている。静の子供が助けられたという説は、吉川英治氏も「新平家物語」の中で採用しておられるので、あながち判官びいきからの俗説ではないのかも知れない。
浄瑠璃といえば、最近かたばみ座が上演したり、五、六年前に伊藤晴雨氏が百万ドル劇場で上演させたりした奥州安達原四段目、「遠行千里の岩峅帯（いわくらおび）」は、いわゆる安達ヶ原の黒塚の伝説を劇化したもので、生駒之助に連れられた恋絹が、安達ヶ原に来て急に腹痛を覚える。
やっとのことで一軒家にたどりつき、生駒之助は老婆と共に薬を求めに町へ下りてゆく。
あとに一人残された恋絹は、障子を開けるなといわれたため、かえって覗いてみたくなり、こっそり開いてみると、そこに髑髏（どくろ）がある。びっくりしている処へ、老婆が一人帰ってくるのである。
婆　其夫の戻らぬ先に、こなたにばが無心がある。
恋　サア其無心とははやんすは、路銀をかせといふのである。わしが肌にはないによって、ちょっと夫を呼んで来て
婆　イヤ銀ばかりぢゃない。路銀よりまだ外に、こなたの腹の子がほしい。
恋　エイ、あの胎内にある子を、どうしておまえ
婆　イヤ心安うとられろ。つい其腹を裁割（たちわ）って、ホホホホあの子とした事が、何のそう震ふ事ぞ、ばばがいたうないやうに、つい一思いに殺してやる。よい子ぢゃ、ここへちっとござれ。南無阿弥陀仏。南無阿弥陀仏。
〜と、となふる口は耳までさけ、安達ヶ原の黒塚に、こも

「頼朝の顔色はいよいよ不快なものになって行った。……

それにしても頼朝が、「静の腹を裂いて、胎児を引きずり出せ」と言ったのは、単に仇である義経の種を宿していたからだけであろうか。災いの芽を断つだけならば、他にも方法はいくらでもある。例えば、どうせ母子共に殺すならば、静の首を討つなり、毒殺するなりしてもよいはずで、殊さらに生体解剖をして辱（はずかし）めを与える必要はないはずである。それをあえて「腹を切り割れ」と言ったのは、何しろ妊娠している日本一の美女。頼朝ならずとも……というのは浅はかな邪推であろうか？

近松門左衛門の『嫩胎内裙（ふたばたいないのすそ）』はこれを脚色したものであるが、これは生まれた男子は、畠山重忠の情で助けられることになっている。静の子が助けられたという説は、吉川英治氏も『新平家物語』の中で採用しておられるので、あながち判官贔屓（ほうがんびいき）からの俗説ではないのかも知れない。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

25: Ventral slitting of women appearing in literature.

"Yoritomo's facial expression became increasingly unpleasant. ... (Omitted) ... 'A hateful woman indeed. How dare she try to take pride in the child of Kuro (Yoshitsune). Kajiwara, quickly slit that woman's belly and take out the child and discard it. To me, it is the descendant of an enemy.' ... (Omitted) ... 'With all due respect,' the veteran Kagetoki stepped forward one knee. 'Former Lord of Iyo, though he is now an enemy, those words are considered a very cruel command. Regardless of after the birth, as for the matter of laying hands on the current Lady Shizuka, please refrain.' 'If I say so and she returns from Kamakura and gives birth afterward, and hides it, it would be equivalent to sending Yoritomo's enemy into the world.' 'Therefore, until she gives birth, keep her in this Kamakura, and if the one born is a female, let her return without any hindrance; only in the event it is a male child, to do as you will would be proper, I believe.' Kagetoki's words were, first of all, common sense. 'Is that so?' Yoritomo answered shortly and reluctantly."

Even so, that Yoritomo said, "Slit Shizuka's belly and drag out the fetus," was it simply because she carried the seed of the enemy Yoshitsune? If it was only to cut off the storm (threat), there are many other methods. For example, if killing both mother and child anyway, striking off Shizuka's head or poisoning her would be fine; there should be no need to perform vivisection particularly to give humiliation. That he dared to say "slice open the belly," after all, she is the pregnant number-one beauty in Japan. Even if not Yoritomo... is it a shallow wicked guess?

Chikamatsu Monzaemon's "Futaba Tainai no Suso" is a dramatization of this, but in this, the born boy is saved by the compassion of Hatakeyama Shigetada. The theory that Shizuka's child was saved is also adopted by Mr. Eiji Yoshikawa in "Shin Heike Monogatari," so it might not necessarily be a mere popular myth from "Hōgan-biiki" (sympathy for the loser).
Speaking of Joruri, recently "Katabami-za" performed it, or five or six years ago Mr. Seiu Ito had it performed at the Million Dollar Theater, the fourth act of "Oshu Adachigahara," "En'gyo Senri no Iwakura-obi," is a dramatization of the so-called legend of the Black Mound of Adachigahara; Koiginu, led by Ikomanosuke, comes to Adachigahara and suddenly feels stomach pain.
Finally reaching a lone house, Ikomanosuke goes down to the town with an old woman to seek medicine.
Koiginu, left alone, because she was told not to open the sliding door, instead wanted to peek; when she secretly opened it, there were skulls. While she was surprised, the old woman returned alone.
Hag: "Before that husband returns, I have a request for you."
Koi: "Now, what is that request? Are you saying to lend travel money? Since I don't have it on me, go call my husband for a moment..."
Hag: "No, not just silver. Even beyond travel money, I want the child in your belly."
Koi: "Eh, that child in the womb, why do you..."
Hag: "No, give it up peacefully. I'll just slice open that belly, ho-ho-ho-ho, talking about that child, why tremble so? The old lady will kill you in one thought (instant) so it doesn't hurt. Good girl, come here a bit. Namu Amida Butsu. Namu Amida Butsu."
...so saying, the chanting mouth tore to the ears, and at the Black Mound of Adachigahara...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Page 25: Graphic Depictions of Women’s Abdominal Mutilation in Literature**

"Yoritomo’s expression grew increasingly dark and resentful. ... 'What a loathsome woman. How dare she flaunt being pregnant with Kuro’s child? Kajiwara, go at once! Rip open her womb, tear out the fetus, and cast it away. To me, that child is nothing but the seed of my enemy.' ... 'Forgive my intrusion,' Kagetoki, the seasoned strategist, said as he knelt forward. 'My Lord, though he is your enemy, your command is far too cruel. Whatever happens after the birth, I beg you to refrain from laying hands on Lady Shizuka while she is in this state.' 'If I let her leave Kamakura and she gives birth in secret,' Yoritomo countered, 'it would be the same as unleashing a future assassin against me.' 'Then keep her here in Kamakura until the child is born,' Kagetoki suggested. 'If it is a girl, let her return home unharmed. If it is a boy, only then should you deal with him as you see fit. That is the path of reason.' Kagetoki’s advice was grounded in basic human decency. 'Very well,' Yoritomo replied curtly and with visible reluctance."

Still, one must wonder: when Yoritomo ordered his men to "slit Shizuka's belly and drag out the fetus," was it truly just because she carried Yoshitsune's child? If his goal was simply to eliminate a political threat, there were plenty of other ways. If mother and child were to die regardless, he could have ordered her beheading or poisoning. There was no practical need to subject her to the public humiliation of a living vivisection. Could it be that his demand to "slice her open" was driven by a darker impulse—after all, she was the most beautiful pregnant woman in all of Japan? Is it merely a base suspicion to suggest that even a man like Yoritomo might have been moved by such a twisted urge?

Chikamatsu Monzaemon’s play *Futaba Tainai no Suso* dramatizes this event, though in his version, the baby boy is saved through the mercy of Hatakeyama Shigetada. The theory that Shizuka’s child survived is also supported by Eiji Yoshikawa in his *New Tale of the Heike*, suggesting it might be more than just a myth born of "Hōgan-biiki"—the traditional Japanese sympathy for the tragic hero.

Regarding puppet theater (Joruri), there is the famous fourth act of *Oshu Adachigahara*, titled "The Iwakura Sash of a Thousand Miles," which was recently staged by the Katabami-za troupe and previously by Seiu Ito at the Million Dollar Theater. This play dramatizes the legend of the "Black Mound of Adachigahara." In the story, a woman named Koiginu, traveling with Ikomanosuke, is overcome by sudden labor pains. They find shelter in a lonely hut, and Ikomanosuke heads to town with an old woman to find medicine. Left alone and told not to look behind the sliding doors, Koiginu’s curiosity gets the better of her. She peeks inside, only to find a pile of human skulls. As she recoils in horror, the old woman returns.

**Hag:** "Before your husband gets back, I have a little favor to ask of you."
**Koiginu:** "A favor? Do you mean travel money? I don't have any on me—please, go find my husband..."
**Hag:** "Oh, it’s not silver I’m after. I want something far more precious than travel money. I want the child in your womb."
**Koiginu:** "What? The child inside me? How could you...?"
**Hag:** "Now, now, just stay still. I’ll just slice that belly right open. Ho-ho-ho! Why are you shaking so much? Grandma will make it quick so it doesn't hurt a bit. There’s a good girl, come closer. *Namu Amida Butsu... Namu Amida Butsu...*"

As she chanted, her mouth tore open all the way to her ears, revealing her true demonic form at the Black Mound of Adachigahara...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is formatted in traditional Japanese vertical columns (tategaki), reading from right to left. The page number "25" is at the top left.
*   **Typography:** The main text uses a standard Mincho-style font typical of mid-20th-century printing. It includes "furigana" (ruby text) for difficult Kanji like "不承（ぶしょう）" and "嫩（ふたば）".
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き" is centered at the top. The first section is a block quote (indicated by brackets), followed by the author's commentary. The bottom section discusses theatrical adaptations and concludes with a dramatic script-like dialogue.
*   **Illustration:** At the top, there is a stylized woodblock-style illustration depicting a woman (likely Shizuka Gozen) in a state of distress or being judged, with a small caption or decorative border.
*   **Structure:** The piece moves from historical/literary anecdote (Minamoto no Yoritomo and Shizuka Gozen) to analytical commentary (questioning Yoritomo's motives) and finally to cultural/theatrical manifestations (Chikamatsu and the Adachigahara legend).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Shizuka Gozen & Yoritomo:** This refers to a famous episode from the *Gikeiki* (Chronicle of Yoshitsune). Shizuka Gozen was the mistress of the tragic hero Minamoto no Yoshitsune. After Yoshitsune fled, his brother Yoritomo captured the pregnant Shizuka. Historically, if she gave birth to a girl, she was released; if a boy, the child was killed. The text here focuses on the more gruesome (and likely fictionalized) version where Yoritomo considers "ventral slitting."
*   **Adachigahara (Kurozuka):** A famous Japanese ghost story/play. An old hag living in a hut kills pregnant travelers to consume the blood or liver of the fetus, often cited as a cure for a disease or for demonic longevity.
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu / Fuzoku Kenkyu:** The tone of the writing suggests the "Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense" era or post-war "Fuzoku" (customs) research magazines (like *Kitan Club* or similar titles from the 1950s). These publications often blended scholarly interest in folklore with a voyeuristic interest in cruelty and the macabre.
*   **Seiu Ito (伊藤晴雨):** Mentioned in the text, he was a real-life artist known for his "torture art" and research into historical punishments. His involvement in a theatrical production at the "Million Dollar Theater" (a famous venue in Asakusa) helps date this text to the mid-20th century (1940s-50s).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **腹裂き (Harasaki):** Literally "belly-splitting." While "Harakiri" is ritual suicide, "Harasaki" in this context refers to the violent, non-consensual mutilation of a woman's abdomen.
*   **不承不承 (Bushō-bushō):** Reluctantly; against one's will.
*   **判官びいき (Hōgan-biiki):** "Sympathy for the Lieutenant" (referring to Yoshitsune's rank). It is a Japanese idiom for favoring the underdog or the tragic loser of a conflict.
*   **生体解剖 (Seitai Kaibō):** Vivisection. The author uses this modern medical term to highlight the cruelty of the historical/legendary act.
*   **無心 (Mushin):** In this context, it means "to beg for something" or "to make an unreasonable request/demand for money or goods."
*   **路銀 (Rogin):** Traveling expenses; money for a journey.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Misogyny and Power:** The text explores historical violence against women as an exercise of male political power (Yoritomo) and supernatural horror (the Hag).
*   **The Macabre as Entertainment:** The transition from a historical debate about Yoritomo’s cruelty to a description of a "Grand Guignol" style stage play suggests the audience's fascination with the "grotesque."
*   **Psychological Speculation:** The author engages in "邪推" (wicked guesswork), wondering if Yoritomo’s cruelty was motivated by a twisted sexual or aesthetic impulse regarding Shizuka’s beauty—a hallmark of mid-century "ero-guro" literature.
*   **Tragedy of the Womb:** The "child in the belly" is treated as a political object, a medical ingredient (for the hag), or a source of tragic irony in theater.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay, Literary Analysis, Folklore/History Research.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Grotesque (Ero-Guro), Folklore, Samurai History, Kabuki/Joruri, Violence against Women, Mythology.
