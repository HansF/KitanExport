つい此の間よ。煙草をくわえて、すまして湯船に入つた人があつた。ところが直ぐ濕りが来て消えてしまつたの。立消えの煙草を持つて上つて来たから何をするだろうと、見て別の煙草を袂から取り出して火をつけてまたお湯につかつてたわ。何だかあたし、それを見て嬉しくなつてしまつたの、あら、そんな意味じやないのよ。

御宅が近いのに、ふだん着に一ぱい膨らんだ紙入れを持つてくる方。
「お民ちやん、預つて呉れないか大してないんだが」
お湯屋は十円札一枚持つてくる処よ。つまらない見榮坊はおよしなさい。

角の酒場に可愛い人（先方じやあうるさい人でしよう）があると自惚れている疊屋の源さん。いい物を見せてやると紙切れを出したから、うつかりのぞいたわ。馬鹿にするわ、あたしの顔を見てるわ、あたしの顔を見てるわ。それが此の間も又別なのを待つて来たからと廣げるから知りませんとはねつけてやつたの。そうしたら女中のお由さんをざるの積んである隅に追い詰めて抱き締めるように覆いかぶさつて無理矢理に見せていたわ。

見せつけられた女の様子が見たいんでしよう。男つて、みんなこういう性質が強いんじやないかとあたし思うんだけど、どう？……

ついこの間よ。タバコをくわえて、すまして湯船に入った人があった。ところがすぐに湿気が来て消えてしまったの。立ち消えのタバコを持って上がってきたから何をするだろうと見ていたら、別のタバコを袂（たもと）から取り出して火をつけて、またお湯に浸かっていたわ。なんだかあたし、それを見て嬉しくなってしまったの。あら、そんな意味じゃないのよ。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The burning matchstick, into the matchbox I threw. That, to the ceiling smoke climbed. I, a real fire it became thought and stood blankly. (To the person who thinks it's a lie, with the intent to waste one box, try a large box and see.) That person frantically struck it down and stepped on it. Mustache and ankle, a little burn he suffered. This kind of person, a burn-free kimono and tatami, no relation having person, right?

Just the other day. A cigarette in mouth, coolly into the bathtub entered a person there was. However, immediately dampness came and it went out. The extinguished cigarette holding, he came up, so "what will he do?" I watched; another cigarette from his sleeve took out, lit it, and again in the bath soaked. Somehow I, seeing that, became happy. Oh, it's not that kind of meaning.

Even though home is near, in everyday clothes a full bulging wallet bringing person.
"O-Tami-chan, won't you keep this for me? It's not much, but..."
A bathhouse is a place for bringing one 10-yen bill. Boring vanity-striver, please stop.

At the corner bar, a cute person (to the other party, a nuisance person probably) there is, so vanity-having Tatami-maker Gen-san. "A good thing I will show you," a piece of paper he took out, so carelessly I peeked. He makes a fool of me, he's looking at my face. That person, the other day again another thing brought, "I'll spread it out," so "I don't know" I rejected him. Then, the maid O-Yoshi-san, into a corner where baskets are piled, he cornered her, as if hugging her he leaned over and forcibly showed it.

The shown-to woman's state he wants to see, right? Men, everyone this kind of nature is strong, isn't it? I think, but how about it?

**This Stupid Bastard**
A miller's wife with a lover in a watermill was trysting, where the husband knocks the door.
Wife: "Now, quickly behind the door hide! At the moment I open it, in that shadow hide, and then run away."
Husband (entering): "Why quickly didn't you open?"
Wife: "Because just now, a spell to drive away rats I was doing. From a great fortune-teller I learned it."
Husband: "Hmm, that, what kind of spell is it?"
Wife: "The head into this bag thrust. And then, as I say, try saying."
The husband obediently, as the wife says, is doing, but the lover forever blankly is standing, so,
Wife (in a small voice): "Why don't you run away? You're so slow-witted."
Lover: "I too, that spell I'm thinking of hearing. At my place too, a huge rat is there, because."

**The Bathhouse Tales & Other Observations**
I once tossed a lit match back into the box. Good grief, the smoke went all the way to the ceiling! I just stood there in a daze, thinking I’d started a real fire. (If you think I’m lying, go ahead and waste a large box trying it yourself.) The man there frantically swatted at the flames and stomped them out. He ended up with a few burns on his mustache and ankles. I suppose he’s the type of man who just isn’t meant to have unburnt kimonos or tatami mats!

Then there was a fellow just the other day. He walked right into the bath with a cigarette in his mouth, looking all cool. Of course, the humidity killed it instantly. He stepped out of the water clutching the dead cigarette, and I wondered what he’d do next. He just pulled another one out of his sleeve, lit it, and hopped right back into the bath. Seeing that made me feel oddly happy—oh, but don't go getting the wrong idea!

And then there are those men who live right nearby but insist on bringing a bulging wallet while dressed in their house clothes. They say, "Hey O-Tami, hold onto this for me, would you? It's not much..." Please! A bathhouse is a place where you bring a single ten-yen note. Give the pathetic vanity a rest.

Old Gen the tatami-maker is convinced there’s a "cute girl" at the corner bar (though he’s likely just a nuisance to her). He pulled out a scrap of paper saying, "I’ve got something good to show you," and I made the mistake of looking. He was just mocking me, staring at my face to see my reaction. When he tried to show me something else recently, I brushed him off. So what does he do? He corners O-Yoshi, the maid, behind a pile of baskets, looms over her like he's going to hug her, and forces her to look at it.

Men just want to see how a woman reacts when they show them something, don't they? I can't help but think that all men have that streak in them. What do you think?

**The Stupid Bastard**
A miller’s wife was having a secret tryst with her lover in the watermill when her husband knocked at the door.
"Quick!" the wife hissed. "Hide behind the door! When I swing it open, stay in the shadow and then make a run for it!"
The husband stormed in. "What took you so long to open the door?"
"I was just performing a spell to drive away the rats," she lied. "A famous fortune-teller taught it to me."
"Hmm. And what kind of spell is that?"
"You just stick your head into this bag," the wife explained, "and repeat everything I say."
The husband obediently stuck his head in the bag and started chanting. But the lover just stood there like an idiot, staring blankly.
"Why haven't you run off yet?" the wife whispered frantically. "Don't be so thick!"
"I'm waiting to hear the rest of the spell!" the lover whispered back. "I've got a hell of a 'rat' back at my house, too!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Structure:** The page is structured into multiple distinct sections: two anecdotal essays/monologues at the top and a scripted comedic story (kobanashi style) at the bottom.
*   **Typography:** The text uses traditional vertical layout (*tategaki*). It features a mix of standard kanji and hiragana, with some furigana (reading aids) provided for difficult words like "頓馬" (tonma - stupid) and "濕り" (shimeri - dampness).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Large, bold titles or lead-ins mark the start of new stories. The bottom story has a clear header: "此の頓馬野郎" (This Stupid Bastard). 
*   **Illustrations:** Two cartoons by an artist named "Keiji" (けいじ). 
    *   The top illustration shows a man in a state of undress (typical for a bathhouse setting) with sound effects "Achi-chi" (Hot!) and "Potsu" (Drip/Pop). 
    *   The middle illustration shows a man with a suggestive expression opening his coat to show something to a woman, matching the text about Gen the tatami-maker. The woman's dialogue is "Shall I show you something good?" with the man laughing "He-he-he."
*   **Column Structure:** The text is divided into thin vertical columns, typical of newspaper or magazine layouts to maximize space.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s - Early 1950s):** The mention of a "10-yen note" (十円札) for a bathhouse suggests the early post-war period. Before hyperinflation settled, 10 yen was a significant but common amount for a service like a public bath. 
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text is representative of "Kasutori magazines," which flourished during the US occupation. They were cheap, printed on poor-quality paper, and focused on "3S" (Screen, Sport, Sex) to provide escapism for a population recovering from war.
*   **The Sento (Public Bath):** Public baths were central to community life. The narrative voice is likely that of a "Banto-san" (bathhouse attendant) or a regular customer observing the eccentricities of the neighborhood men. 
*   **Social Conventions:** The stories play on the trope of the "show-off" (miebō) and the "lecherous old man," which were staples of Edo-period *rakugo* (storytelling) and carried into post-war pulp humor.
*   **The Watermill Tryst:** The watermill (*suishagoya*) is a classic literary setting for illicit affairs in Japanese folklore and humor, representing a secluded place away from the village.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **頓馬 (Tonma):** An archaic or colloquial term for a fool, simpleton, or "blockhead." 
*   **袂 (Tamoto):** The sleeve of a kimono, often used as a pocket in pre-modern and early modern Japan.
*   **見榮坊 (Miebō):** Someone who puts on airs or tries to look more important/wealthy than they are. 
*   **逢曳 (Abiki/Aibiki):** A secret meeting between lovers; a tryst.
*   **易者 (Ekishya):** A fortune-teller or diviner. In the story, the wife uses "superstition" to trick her gullible husband.
*   **色男 (Iro-otoko):** A "lady-killer" or a handsome lover, often used in a slightly derogatory or scandalous sense in these comedies.
*   **軸木 (Jikugi):** The wooden stem of a match.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Sexual Innuendo:** The text is rife with "double-entendre." The man showing something "good" under his coat and the "rat" in the watermill story are thinly veiled references to male anatomy and infidelity.
*   **The "Battle of the Sexes":** The narrator (a woman) mocks the vanity and predictable lechery of men. She portrays them as either foolishly trying to impress women with money or driven by a compulsive need to "show" themselves.
*   **Cuckoldry and Deception:** The bottom story is a classic *kobanashi* (short joke) about a wife outsmarting her husband. The punchline—the lover being too stupid to realize he's in danger because he wants to learn the "trick" for his own unfaithful wife—adds a layer of irony.
*   **Observational Realism:** The descriptions of bathhouse behavior (smoking in the tub, bringing a fat wallet) serve as a social critique of post-war masculinity and the performative nature of "coolness."
