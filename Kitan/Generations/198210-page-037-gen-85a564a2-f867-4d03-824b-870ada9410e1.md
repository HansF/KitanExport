## Literal English Translation
And, I often used a rubber raincoat. It takes about twenty minutes from home to school. From the moment I started pedaling my bicycle, my entire body would sweat and the sweat would flow, so by the time I arrived at school, my whole body was completely soaked. At that moment, I felt the sensation of the rubber raincoat clinging tightly to my body, and I was involuntarily aroused, running straight to the restroom to masturbate desperately. Since that time, I have been possessed by the demonic power of raw rubber. After graduating high school and starting work, I began to avidly read “Kitan Club,” and the one who gave such a powerful shock to me was, without a doubt, this Ms. Sachiko. Since then, I have solely dreamt of Ms. Sachiko. Even now, at this very moment, I dream of Ms. Sachiko and love her phantom. The Ms. Sachiko I imagine is a small woman who looks good in Japanese clothes (Kimono), and whom I believe to be a virtuous person who practices tea ceremony and flower arrangement daily. I think of her as an angelic woman who embraces men with warm maternal instinct. Whether such a woman truly exists in this current age is unclear, but I intend to continue loving the phantom of Ms. Sachiko hereafter, simply and solely. Furthermore, if, by any chance, someone knows the whereabouts (news/contact information) of Ms. Sachiko, I ask that you kindly take the trouble to inform me.
I earnestly request this.

## Literary English Translation
I frequently wore a rubber raincoat. It took about twenty minutes to cycle from my home to school. The instant I started pedaling, my entire body would begin streaming with sweat, and by the time I reached school, I would be absolutely drenched from head to toe. In those moments, the sensation of the rubber rain gear clinging tightly to my skin would involuntarily excite me, and I would rush into the restroom to masturbate furiously. From then on, I fell under the demonic thrall of raw rubber. After graduating high school and starting my career, I became an avid reader of the *Kitan Club*, and the person who delivered a powerful shock to my senses was none other than this Ms. Sachiko. Since that moment, I have been solely focused on dreaming of Ms. Sachiko. Even now, in this very instant, I dream of Ms. Sachiko and cherish her illusion. The Ms. Sachiko I envision is a petite woman who looks lovely in a kimono; I imagine her to be a virtuous individual who dedicates her time to traditional arts like tea ceremony and flower arrangement. I see her as an angelic figure who wraps men in her warm maternal embrace. Whether such a woman actually exists in this modern era, I cannot say, but I intend to continue loving the phantom of Ms. Sachiko purely and completely. Therefore, should anyone, by chance, have any information regarding Ms. Sachiko’s whereabouts, I humbly ask that you take the trouble to notify me.
I earnestly make this plea.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely section type:** Reader Letter / Confessional (読者告白). The content structure describes a personal sexual history, names a figure encountered through the magazine ("幸子氏"), and concludes with a direct appeal for contact information, typical of an interactive submissions section.
*   **Author attribution:** An anonymous male reader/contributor ("私").
*   **Editorial voice vs narrator voice:** The text is presented entirely as the narrator's authentic voice, detailing a progression from physical fetish (rubber/sweat) to psychological obsession with a specific female figure linked to the magazine.
*   **Target audience signals:** Readers engaged with rubber/latex fetishism, BDSM/kinbaku themes (explicitly via the Ranzan illustration), and those who seek to bridge the gap between idealized fantasy and real-world connection through the magazine community.
*   **Positioning within the magazine:** Page 37 is standard placement for illustrated reader submissions designed to engage the core readership with highly specific fetish content.
*   **Visual Context:** The illustration by Ranzan depicts a highly posed, nude, and heavily bound woman, explicitly linking the "powerful shock" delivered by Ms. Sachiko to the themes of Japanese bondage (Kinbaku), which is not explicitly mentioned in the text but is the visual complement.

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Ero-Guro Context:** This piece is a textbook example of postwar Japanese ero-guro literature, blending the exploration of unconventional sexual practices (fetishism, masturbation) with literary descriptions of obsession.
*   **Rubber/Sweat Fetish:** The description of arousal triggered by the confining, hot, and sweaty rubber raincoat (*gomu kappa*) is a common trope in early Japanese fetish writing, often symbolizing sensual constraint and the transcendence of discomfort into pleasure.
*   **The Sachiko Paradox:** The narrator’s ideal, Ms. Sachiko, embodies the classic *Kitan Club* duality: she is outwardly the picture of traditional Japanese virtue (貞淑, kimono, tea ceremony) but is simultaneously the source of a "powerful shock." This juxtaposition of the demure and the perverse served to eroticize societal conformity itself.
*   **Maternal Domination:** The emphasis on her "warm maternal instinct" (母性本能) suggests a subtextual desire for powerful, nurturing control—a form of benign dominance where the male is "embraced" and sheltered by the female. This is a common trope in Japanese BDSM and submission fantasies of the era.
*   **Ranzan:** The illustrator Ranzan (乱山) was a prominent artist specializing in erotic and bondage imagery, cementing the visual interpretation of Sachiko's "shock" as related to Kinbaku, even if the written text focuses more on rubber and idealized virtue.
*   **Historical Kana:** The use of older orthography (e.g., `かゝります`, `しまひました`) anchors the text firmly in the post-war early Showa era when *Kitan Club* was in its heyday.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **ゴム合羽 (Gomu Kappa):** Rubber raincoat. Key fetish trigger (Gomufeti).
*   **昂奮 (Kōfun):** Intense excitement; used here to mean sexual arousal.
*   **自慰 (Jii):** Masturbation (a relatively formal/clinical term).
*   **生ゴムの魔力 (Namagomu no Maryoku):** The magical/demonic power of raw rubber. Anthropomorphizes the material, giving it a powerful, controlling presence.
*   **「奇ク」 (Kiku):** Abbreviation for 奇譚クラブ (Kitan Club), the likely publication.
*   **貞淑 (Teishuku):** Virtuous, chaste. Used to highlight the conventional perfection of the desired woman, contrasting with her fetishistic role.
*   **母性本能 (Bosei Hōnnō):** Maternal instinct. Functions as a euphemism for dominant, nurturing control or submission fantasy.
*   **幻 (Maboroshi):** Phantom, illusion. Acknowledges the unreal, idealized nature of the object of obsession.
*   **消息 (Shōsoku):** Whereabouts, news, contact information. The request implies the identity of Ms. Sachiko is known or discussed within the readership.

## Themes & Subtext
*   **Fetishistic Origin Story:** The narrative functions as an etiological account of the narrator's specific sexual fixation, tracing it from an accidental physical stimulus (sweaty rubber confinement) to a focused, idealized human obsession.
*   **The Sacred and the Profane:** Ms. Sachiko represents the ultimate intersection of the sacred (貞淑, angelic, maternal) and the profane (source of powerful shock, linked visually to bondage). The fantasy is derived from reconciling these opposites.
*   **The Power of the Media:** The magazine *Kitan Club* ("奇ク") is explicitly identified as the catalyst for the transfer of the narrator's fetish onto a human target. It acts as both a marketplace for fantasies and a potential avenue for their realization (via the plea for contact).
*   **Desire for Annihilation/Absorption:** The wish for a woman who will "embrace" (包み込んでくれる) him with her maternal instinct suggests a desire to be overwhelmed, controlled, and submerged, linking the physical constriction of the rubber suit to psychological submission.
