## Literal English Translation

**Seeking Strange Tales**

My husband is a man of thirty-five years, who was welcomed as an adopted son from a certain agricultural village in the countryside last summer. His body is robust and he handles his work well, but there is one abnormal sexual proclivity, and night after night he torments me.

That is, he tears the *hadajuban* (undergarment) I am wearing, and sniffs around those scraps of cloth—that is his sexual release/liberation. When it happened for the first time, I could not bear the shame and broke down weeping. However, my husband saw that sight, became excited, and further tried to bind me tightly.

How should I deal with this perverted taste/hobby? Please teach me.

(Tokyo - Housewife A-ko)

## Literary English Translation

**Seeking the Bizarre**

My husband is a thirty-five-year-old man who was adopted into our family last summer from a certain village in the provinces. He is physically strong and performs his work diligently, but he harbors an abnormal sexual proclivity that causes him to torment me night after night.

Specifically, he tears the shift I am wearing and begins sniffing the fragments of fabric. This, he claims, is his sexual liberation. The first time this occurred, I was overcome by shame and collapsed, weeping uncontrollably. Yet, seeing my distress only excited my husband, and he attempted to bind me even more tightly.

I beg of you, please advise me on how I should handle this perverted fixation.

(A-ko, Housewife, Tokyo)

## Structural & Editorial Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Section Type** | Reader Submission / Confessional Letter (*Tōkō*) |
| **Column Title** | **奇譚を索る** (Seeking Strange Tales/The Bizarre). This signifies the editors are actively soliciting unusual or sexually deviant confessions, positioning the letter as a case study. |
| **Author Attribution** | Pseudonymous (A子 - A-ko) and defined by location/status (東京・主婦 - Tokyo, Housewife). This anonymization encourages frankness while emphasizing her domestic, respectable status contrasted with the bizarre content. |
| **Editorial Voice** | Absent in the text block itself, but the framing device ("Seeking Strange Tales") establishes a tone of sensational observation and prurient curiosity. |
| **Narrator Voice** | First-person confessional, deeply distressed, seeking external validation or instruction ("お教え下さいませ" - Please teach me/advise me). The tone is highly vulnerable but structured, detailing the chronology and nature of the husband's actions. |
| **Target Audience** | Readers interested in sexual deviance, psychological anomalies, marital distress, and voyeuristic consumption of private life, typical of *Kitan Club*'s readership. |
| **Positioning** | Likely placed early in a dedicated correspondence or counseling section, perhaps adjacent to an editor's response or psychological commentary. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Yōshi (養子 / Adopted Son):** In mid-20th century Japan, adult male adoption (especially of a husband, *Muko-Yōshi* / 婿養子) was common to ensure the continuation of the family line, name, and/or business when there was no male heir. This often placed the adopted man in a subordinate or anxious position within the wife's family structure, which might correlate to behavioral stress or deviance.
*   **某農村 (A certain agricultural village):** The husband’s provincial, rural origin contrasts with A-ko's urban (Tokyo) housewife status, suggesting a potential clash of cultural backgrounds or sophistication levels, often used in *Kitan Club* to frame deviance as stemming from "primitive" or unsophisticated backgrounds.
*   **肌襦袢 (Hadajuban):** A traditional close-fitting undergarment (shift or chemise) worn beneath the kimono or other layers. Tearing and sniffing the *hadajuban* is highly symbolic, involving violation of intimate boundaries, domestic propriety, and the direct scent of the woman—a classic form of Olfactophilia (scent fetish) often combined with Frotteurism or mild Sadism.
*   **羞恥に耐えきれず泣き伏せました (Could not bear the shame and wept):** The expectation of female modesty (*shūchi*) was extremely high in postwar society. The narrative presents her reaction as passive distress, which, according to the text, feeds the husband's excitement, reflecting traditional power dynamics where female suffering is eroticized for male pleasure.
*   **変態的趣味 (Hentai-teki Shumi):** The use of *hentai* (perverse/abnormal) and *shumi* (hobby/taste) is a characteristic mid-century way of categorizing and somewhat normalizing unusual sexual behaviors by framing them as idiosyncratic "tastes."

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Japanese) | Transcription | Meaning/Nuance | Euphemistic/Historical Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **奇譚** | *Kitan* | Strange/Bizarre Tale | Refers to anything sensational, often sexual or supernatural; the genre name. |
| **養子** | *Yōshi* | Adopted Son | Specifically, an adult adopted male, often a son-in-law (*Muko-yōshi*). |
| **性癖** | *Seiheki* | Sexual Proclivity/Habit | A clinical or quasi-clinical term for sexual behavior, usually implying deviance or fixation. |
| **責める** | *Sameru* | To blame, critique, or torment | Here, used euphemistically for sexually "punishing" or dominating/distressing the wife. |
| **肌襦袢** | *Hadajuban* | Undergarment/Shift | Traditional kimono underclothing, highly intimate and personal. |
| **嗅ぎ回る** | *Kagimawaru* | To sniff around/Search by scent | Direct description of the fetishistic act (Olfactophilia). |
| **性の解放** | *Sei no Kaihō* | Sexual Liberation/Release | Used by the husband to rationalize his behavior; suggests a need to break societal sexual constraints through this specific act. |
| **趣味** | *Shumi* | Hobby, Taste, Interest | Used here as a euphemism for "fetish" or "perversion" (*hentai-teki shumi*). |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

*   **Marriage and Dissatisfaction:** The text reveals a profound failure of intimacy in an arranged or convenience marriage (implied by the *yōshi* system). The husband’s actions are a violent imposition rather than shared desire.
*   **Olfactophilia and Destruction:** The core fetish involves the scent of the wife's body (via the *hadajuban*) combined with a destructive impulse (tearing the cloth). This links sexual gratification directly to the breaking of domestic boundaries and the degradation of the wife's personal effects.
*   **Sadomasochistic Dynamic (Mild):** The husband is excited by the wife's genuine shame (*shūchi*) and tears. His subsequent attempt to "bind her tightly" introduces explicit BDSM (binding/shibari) elements, establishing a clear power imbalance where the wife's distress is the prerequisite for his excitement.
*   **Confession as Voyeurism:** A-ko's letter functions as a classic *Kitan Club* piece: a respectable woman publicly reveals a horrifying secret, allowing readers to consume the tension between social propriety and private, violent sexuality.
