誘惑の魔手から逃れたか。

小説の種になった社長
山本　栄

一
　日が暮れて家へ帰つてみると、今日は早く帰つてくるといつていたサツキが帰つておらないので、どうしたんだろうと、ふと、机の上へ眼をやると手紙らしき走り書きがおかれてあつた。
　よほどあわてて書いたものと見えて、ひどく乱雑な筆跡である。
「同業者の総会にて、社長と同道、武田尾温泉へ七時の急行でゆきます。旅館は翠明ホテルです。今夜は帰れないかもしれませんが、御心配なさらないように、大丈夫です」
　読みながら私は「馬鹿、馬鹿」と、どなりつけた。
「何が心配なさらないように」だ。
「何が大丈夫」なのだ。ついに私が危惧していたことが、いまわしい現実となつて現れたのだ。
　私の勤めていた高島産業株式会社が経営不振でつぶれたのは三月前のことである。
　整理でクビになつたのなら、まだしも退職手当でも貰えたろうに、会社自身が破産したのだから、全く無一文で失業してしまつたのである。
　この節のこととて、失業すれば、中々就職出来ず、たまに職があつても、私のような弱い身体の者には耐えられぬような重労働である。衣料、家財道具を売つては、その日の生計にあてるより仕方がなく、それとても限度のあることで、いつまでつづけられるやら。そんな状態に我慢出来なくなつたのであろう。サツキがある日、私に内緒で、新聞の求人案内欄を見て、求めて来た職が、現在勤めている不二建設会社の秘書であつた。その日、サツキは意気揚々と帰つて来て、誇らしげに告げるのであつた。
「あの会社はずいぶん景気がよさそうよ。一万円くれるのよ」
「へえ」
　私はおどろいた。私でさえ、手取り八千圓しかとつていなかつたのに、珠算簿記が出来るでなし、タイプが打てるサツキではない。どうしてそんな高給を出すのか、不思議であつた。
「どんな仕事をやるんだね」
「社長の秘書よ、社長宛の手紙の整理や、面会人の応接など、やればいいのよ。楽な仕事よ」
「それで一万円くれるのかね。結構な会社だね。その代り、待合出張も時には仰せつかるんだろう」
「まあ、あなた。ケチをつけるの。それともひがんでいるの。男らしくないわ。あなたは当分、お好きな三文小説でも書いていらつしゃれればいいの」
　サツキの就職に私は不服であつた。
　第一にその一万円という不当によい給料が曲物だつたし、建設会社といつても、その前身は××組といつた土建組であろう。ひいてはその社長たるも土方の親分の成上り者だろう。私はその社長という男が推測ではあるが、好色家のヒトデ親爺に思えて仕方がない。それにサツキは夫の私が自慢するのもおかしいが、一寸した美人であるので不安でたまらなかつた。が、今の経済的ピンチを切り抜けるためには、やつぱりサツキに働いて貰うより仕方なく不承々々サツキの勤めを承知した。

二
　ところが、サツキが勤め出して、二月もすると、サツキの服装が、がらりと変つてしまつた。服は今流行のものだし、靴もどうやら舶来の品らしい。金の小さな時計、オパールの素晴らしい指輪。ひどくパリつとした。給料は全部生計費に当ててしまうのだから、そんな高価な品々が購えそうな筈がない。
「服に靴。時計に指輪。一体、どうしたんだ」
「これ？　皆、社長が買つてくれたの」
「危險だと思わないのかね、そんな不当な物を貰つて」
「いえ、決して不当じゃないわ。社長は私をつれて、いろんな会に出席するでしょう。私がみすぼらしい装をしていれば、社長の顔にかかわるんですもの。だから仕事の必要上買つてくれたんですわ」
　私の想像どおり、社長は最後のものを手にいれる投資を出しだのである。
「それが社長の手なんだよ。後で後悔しても追つかへんぞ。一応忠告しておくよ」
「大丈夫よ。私だつて、娘じゃないんだから、ちゃんと心得てますわ」

　私はサツキの置手紙をにぎりしめながら、あんなに忠告しておいたのにと、私の忠告を容れなかつたサツキに腹が立つた。

Did she escape from the demonic hand of temptation?

(Center title and author)
The President Who Became the Seed of a Novel
by Sakae Yamamoto

I
When the sun set and I returned home, Satsuki, who had said she would return early today, was not back. Wondering what happened, my eyes accidentally fell upon the desk, where a scribbled note like a letter had been left.
It seemed she had written it in quite a rush; the handwriting was extremely messy.
"At a general meeting of industry peers, accompanying the President, I am going to Takeda-o Onsen on the 7 o'clock express. The inn is the Suimei Hotel. I might not be able to return tonight, but please do not worry, it is okay."
As I read, I shouted, "Fool, fool!"
"What do you mean, 'do not worry'!"
"What do you mean, 'it is okay'!" Finally, what I had been fearing had appeared as a loathsome reality.
It was three months ago that Takashima Industries Co., Ltd., where I worked, collapsed due to poor management.
If I had been fired in a restructuring, at least I might have received severance pay, but since the company itself went bankrupt, I became unemployed and completely penniless.
Being these times, if one becomes unemployed, it is quite hard to find work, and even if there is a job, it is heavy labor that someone with a weak body like mine cannot endure. I had no choice but to sell clothes and household furniture to pay for daily living, and even that had its limits; I wondered how long I could continue. Unable to endure such a state, Satsuki, one day without telling me, looked at the job recruitment section of the newspaper and sought a job, which was as a secretary at the Fuji Construction Company where she currently works. That day, Satsuki came home in high spirits and told me proudly:
"That company seems to be doing very well. They'll give me 10,000 yen."
"Huh."
I was surprised. Even I had only been taking home 8,000 yen, and Satsuki is not someone who can do abacus bookkeeping or type. I wondered why they would pay such a high salary.
"What kind of work will you do?"
"I'm the President's secretary. Organizing letters addressed to the President, receiving visitors... I just have to do those. It's easy work."
"And they give you 10,000 yen for that? What a fine company. In exchange, I suppose you'll occasionally be ordered to do 'waiting-house' business trips."
"Oh, you. Are you finding fault? Or are you just jealous? It's not manly. For the time being, why don't you just stay here and write those 'three-cent novels' you like."
I was dissatisfied with Satsuki's employment.
Firstly, that improperly high salary of 10,000 yen was suspicious, and even if they called it a construction company, its predecessor was likely a civil engineering gang called the "XX-gumi." Consequently, the President must be a "nouveau riche" former laborer boss. Although it was just my guess, I couldn't help but think of this President as a lecherous, starfish-like old man. Furthermore, though it's strange for me as her husband to brag, Satsuki is quite a beauty, so I was unbearably anxious. However, to get through the current economic pinch, there was no choice but to have Satsuki work, so I grudgingly consented to her job.

II
However, after Satsuki had been working for about two months, her attire changed completely. Her clothes were of the latest fashion, and her shoes seemed to be imported goods. A small gold watch, a wonderful opal ring. She looked very "sharp." Since her entire salary was put toward living expenses, there was no way she could have purchased such expensive items.
"The clothes, the shoes. The watch and the ring. Just what is going on?"
"These? The President bought them all for me."
"Don't you think it's dangerous, accepting such improper things?"
"No, it's not improper at all. The President takes me along to attend various meetings, right? If I look shabby, it affects the President's reputation. So he bought them for me because the job requires it."
Just as I imagined, the President had put out the "investment" to get his hands on the final prize.
"That's the President's trick. It'll be too late to regret it later. I'm warning you."
"It's fine. I'm not a young girl anymore, I know what I'm doing."

As I gripped Satsuki's note, I felt a surge of anger at her for not listening to my advice, even though I had warned her so much.

**Did she escape the clutches of temptation?**

### The President Who Became a Plot Point
**By Sakae Yamamoto**

**I**
When dusk fell and I returned home, Satsuki was nowhere to be found, despite promising an early return. My eyes caught a frantic scrawl on the desk—a note left in a desperate hurry.

*"Attending an industry summit with the President. Taking the 7:00 PM express to Takeda-o Onsen. Staying at the Suimei Hotel. I might not make it back tonight, but don't worry—everything is fine."*

"Fool! You damn fool!" I spat at the empty room. 

"Don't worry?" "Everything is fine?" The very nightmare I had been dreading had finally manifested as a loathsome reality.

It had been three months since Takashima Industries, my former employer, folded. Had it been a simple layoff, I might have salvaged a severance package. But the company went bankrupt, leaving me penniless and adrift. In these lean times, work is scarce; what little exists is backbreaking labor—something my frail constitution simply cannot withstand. We survived by hawking our clothes and furniture, but a house can only be hollowed out for so long. 

Driven by desperation, Satsuki went behind my back, scouring the classifieds until she landed a role as a secretary for Fuji Construction. She came home that day, beaming with a pride that stung.

"The company is rolling in it," she boasted. "They’re starting me at ten thousand yen."

"Ten thousand?" I was floored. Even at my peak, I only cleared eight thousand. Satsuki had no skills—no abacus, no bookkeeping, not even typing. The math didn't add up. "What exactly does a 'secretary' do there?"

"I manage the President’s correspondence, greet his guests... simple things. It's easy work."

"Ten thousand yen for 'easy work'? Sounds like a dream. I suppose the 'easy work' includes overnight 'business trips' to teahouses, too?"

"Oh, stop it! Are you trying to jinx me, or are you just bitter? It's pathetic. Why don't you just stick to writing those cheap pulp stories you're so fond of and leave the earning to me?"

I loathed the idea of her working there. That inflated salary smelled of a trap. "Fuji Construction" was likely just a polished front for some old labor gang like the "XX-Gumi," and the President was undoubtedly some nouveau-riche thug who’d traded his shovel for a suit. In my mind’s eye, I saw him: a lecherous old bottom-feeder. Satsuki, god help me, is a beauty, and that beauty was a liability. But with our pockets empty, I had no choice but to swallow my pride and let her go.

**II**
Two months into the job, Satsuki was a different woman. Her wardrobe was suddenly high fashion; her shoes bore the mark of foreign imports. A delicate gold watch graced her wrist, and an opal ring shimmered on her finger. She looked radiant—and expensive. Since every yen of her salary went toward our survival, there was no way she could afford these luxuries.

"The clothes, the shoes, the jewelry... where did it all come from?"

"These? The President bought them."

"And you don't see the danger? Accepting 'gifts' like these?"

"Don't be dramatic. He takes me to high-level meetings. If I look like a beggar, it reflects poorly on him. These aren't gifts; they're the tools of the trade."

It was exactly as I feared. The President was making his final "investment" before claiming the prize.

"It's a trap, Satsuki. By the time you realize it, there will be no turning back. Consider this a final warning."

"I'll be fine. I'm not some naive schoolgirl. I know exactly what I'm doing."

Now, standing in our dim room, I crumpled her note in my fist. I had warned her. I had told her exactly what would happen. And yet, she had gone anyway. The anger burned in my throat—not just at the President, but at her.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** This is a piece of **popular fiction (pulp/popular literature)**, specifically categorized as *kasutori* literature. It utilizes a first-person "confessional" narrative style common in the era.
*   **Author Attribution:** Sakae Yamamoto (山本 栄). The name is likely a pen name; many writers for these magazines were established authors writing under pseudonyms for extra cash.
*   **Editorial Voice:** The teaser at the top ("Did she escape the demonic hand of temptation?") is an editorial "hook" designed to entice the reader with the promise of scandal or sexual peril.
*   **Target Audience:** Working-class or lower-middle-class men in the post-war era. The narrator’s plight (unemployed, "weak-bodied," emasculated by a higher-earning wife/partner) would have resonated deeply with men struggling in the 1950s economy.
*   **Positioning:** This appears to be the lead-in to a longer story. It sets up a "cuckoldry" or "corruption" dynamic, a staple of the *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque) genre.

---

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

*   **Takeda-o Onsen (武田尾温泉):** A hot spring resort near Hyogo/Osaka. In Showa-era fiction, a "company trip" to an onsen with a male boss was a universal code for an extramarital affair or sexual solicitation.
*   **Post-War Economic Hardship:** The narrator's company "Takashima Industries" went bankrupt. The early 1950s (Dodge Line era) saw many such collapses. The "weak body" (弱い身体) of the narrator suggests he is a white-collar intellectual (intellectually superior but physically inferior) compared to the "nouveau-riche" construction boss.
*   **Construction Companies & "Gumi" (組):** The narrator suspects the company's roots are in a "XX-gumi." In the post-war reconstruction boom, many construction firms were indeed run by former labor bosses or yakuza-affiliated groups who became incredibly wealthy through government contracts.
*   **Salaries (8,000 vs 10,000 yen):** In the early 1950s, 10,000 yen was a very high monthly salary for a woman. For context, a starting civil servant made around 5,000-7,000 yen. The high pay immediately signals sexual "extracurriculars."
*   **Machiai (待合):** The narrator mentions "Machiai business trips." A *machiai* was a traditional "waiting house" used for secret meetings, often involving geisha or trysts.

---

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Masyu (魔手):** Lit. "Demonic Hand." A common pulp term for a predator's reach or the "clutches" of sin.
*   **Narikin (成上り者):** A nouveau-riche person. Used pejoratively here to suggest the President has money but no class.
*   **Sanmon Shousetsu (三文小説):** "Three-penny novel." Refers to cheap, sensationalist pulp fiction. The wife uses this to belittle the narrator's status as a failed intellectual/writer.
*   **Hitode-oyaji (ヒトデ親爺):** Lit. "Starfish old man." Likely used as a slang term for a "bottom-feeder" or a clingy, lecherous man.
*   **Pari-to-shita (パリつとした):** Onomatopoeic for looking crisp, well-dressed, or "sharp."

---

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Emasculation and Poverty:** The core of the drama is the narrator's loss of the "provider" role. His unemployment forces him to allow his wife to enter a situation he knows is sexually dangerous.
*   **The "Secretary" Euphemism:** In this era's media, "Secretary" was often synonymous with "Mistress" or "Escort," particularly in the context of the construction and political industries.
*   **The Gaze of the Intellectual:** The narrator looks down on the President as a "thug" and on his wife's choice as "foolish," yet he is powerless to stop it because he is physically "weak" and financially destitute.
*   **Voyeurism/Cuckoldry:** The story invites the reader to share in the narrator's jealous anxiety, a common trope in *Kitan Club* that borders on a cuckoldry fantasy.

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** High (Implied/Suggestive). Themes of adultery, "selling" oneself for luxury goods, and power-imbalance sexual relations.
*   **Violence:** Low (None present on this page).
*   **Themes:** Economic desperation, infidelity, class conflict, gender role reversal.
