「私妊娠したらしいの、」
誰もいない静かな喫茶店の隅で、艶子は卯一郎をながし眼で見乍ら言った。
男は予期せぬ事を言われて、信ぜられぬ様に小さい目をうろ／＼させた。
体は細い方だが筋ばつた強さがあり、顔全体小作りで、とりわけ目は象の様に小さく、黒目は終始うろ／＼とよく動いて、時にするどさそうに光る。狐の様な感じのする男である。
「あなたと一緒になつた初めての時、あの時直ぐ宿つたらしいわ。」
顔見知りの喫茶店のマダムは、意味あり気な二人のひそ／＼話に気をきかして、カウンタの隅で本をよんでいる。

卯一郎には結婚して十年になる妻があるが、子供に恵まれなかつた。妻の菊代は一年に一度しか月のものを見ず病身で、彼は仲人に欺されて、肉体的缺陷のある妻と一緒になつた。だから健康で正常な男の自分が、他の女性を求めるのは無理ではない。然し菊代は自分の病身が男に不満を與えている事に卑下して、内気であり、忠実に彼に仕えるので、不具の女であるけれど飼殺しの積りで、別れずにいるのだ。と人に言っていた。
親も兄弟もなく、医者の車引きから自動車の運転手に、そして終戦後のインフレのどさくさにまぎれてヤミ屋の親分になり、店先を借りて古着屋を始めた。相当悪ごすく世渡りして来た彼も、人並みに子供がほしい、という気が起つていた。四十男の図々しさとずるさが全身にみちている卯一郎も、艶子には心から打ちとけて、気をゆるして物を言う。

艶子は彼と同業の古着屋の娘で、廣島で芸者をしていたが、朝鮮に渡り、かなりいい旦那をつかんで、贅沢な生活をしている中、終戦の爲、内地に引き上げて来て、ブラ／＼していた、素人離れのした着付、化粧のうまさは、野暮つたいヤミ屋町ではきわだつて人目についた。
男から自分の体と引きかえに金をとる術しか知らぬ社会を泳いで来た女故内地へ戻つて来ても、独身女の地味な暮しが出来る筈もなく、ヤミ肥りの卯一郎に得意の手練で身を投げかけていた。
「私は子沢山の親の爲、芸者になつてあの社会のおきまりどおり、旦那をとつて生活してきました。けれど一度も妊娠した事などなかつたのに、貴方との初夜で直ぐ妊娠してしまつたのです

「私、妊娠したらしいの。」
誰もいない静かな喫茶店の隅で、艶子（つやこ）は卯一郎（ういちろう）を流し目で見て言いながら言った。
男は予期せぬことを言われて、信じられない様子で小さい目をうろうろさせた。
体は細い方だが筋張った強さがあり、顔全体は小作りで、とりわけ目は象のように小さく、黒目は終始うろうろとよく動いて、時に鋭そうに光る。狐のような感じのする男である。
「あなたと一緒になった初めての時、あの時すぐ宿ったらしいわ。」
顔見知りの喫茶店のマダムは、意味ありげな二人のひそひそ話に気を利かせて、カウンターの隅で本を読んでいる。

卯一郎には結婚して十年になる妻がいるが、子供に恵まれなかった。妻の菊代（きくよ）は一年に一度しか月のもの（生理）を見ず病身で、彼は仲人に騙されて、肉体的欠陥のある妻と一緒になった。だから健康で正常な男の自分が、他の女性を求めるのは無理はない。しかし菊代は自分の病身が男に不満を与えていることに卑下して、内気であり、忠実に彼に仕えるので、不自由な女ではあるけれど、一生養う（飼い殺しにする）つもりで、別れずにいるのだ、と人に言っていた。
親も兄弟もなく、医者の車引きから自動車の運転手に、そして終戦後のインフレのどさくさに紛れて闇屋の親分になり、店先を借りて古着屋を始めた。相当あくどく世渡りしてきた彼も、人並みに子供がほしい、という気が起こっていた。四十男の図々しさと狡賢さが全身に満ちている卯一郎も、艶子には心から打ち解けて、気を許して物を言う。

艶子は彼と同業の古着屋の娘で、広島で芸者をしていたが、朝鮮に渡り、かなり良い旦那を捕まえて贅沢な生活をしている中、終戦のため、内地に引き揚げて来てぶらぶらしていた。素人離れした着付けや化粧の巧さは、野暮ったい闇屋街では際立って人目を引いた。

**Three Wives Who Escaped**
**By Den Yasuko**
**Illustrated by Toshiyuki**

(1)
"I, it seems [I] became pregnant,"
In the corner of a quiet coffee shop where no one was, Tsuyako said while looking at Uichiro with a sidelong glance.
The man, being told an unexpected thing, made [his] small eyes wander about as if unable to believe it.
[His] body was on the thin side but had a sinewy strength; the whole face was small-featured, and especially the eyes were small like an elephant's, and the pupils moved well, wandering about constantly, and sometimes flashed sharply. He is a man who gives a fox-like impression.
"The first time [I] became [one] with you, at that time [it] seems [it] was immediately conceived."
The madam of the coffee shop, an acquaintance, being tactful about the two's meaningful whispering, is reading a book in the corner of the counter.

Uichiro has a wife of ten years of marriage, but was not blessed with children. The wife Kikuyo only saw her "monthly thing" once a year and was sickly; he was deceived by a matchmaker and became together with a wife who has physical defects. Therefore, [that] he, a healthy and normal man, seeks other women is not unreasonable. However, because Kikuyo humbles herself over the fact that her sickly body gives the man dissatisfaction, is introverted, and serves him faithfully, although she is an impaired woman, with the intention of "keeping her until death" (kaigoroshi), he remains without parting—so he told people.
Having neither parents nor siblings, from a doctor's rickshaw puller to an automobile driver, and then mingling in the chaos of the post-war inflation, he became a boss of black marketeers and started a second-hand clothes shop by renting a storefront. He, who had lived his life quite unscrupulously, had developed a feeling that he wanted a child like ordinary people. Uichiro, who is filled in his whole body with the audacity and cunning of a forty-year-old man, also opens his heart to Tsuyako and speaks without reserve.

Tsuyako was the daughter of a second-hand clothes dealer in the same trade; she was a geisha in Hiroshima but crossed over to Korea, caught a fairly good "master" (patron), and while living a luxurious life, because of the end of the war, she repatriated to the home islands and was idling about. Her dressing and makeup skill, far from that of an amateur, stood out and caught people's eyes in the boorish black market town.
Because she was a woman who had swum through a society knowing only the art of taking money from men in exchange for her own body, even having returned to the home islands, there was no way she could live the plain life of a single woman, and she had cast herself at the black-market-fattened Uichiro with her expert skills.
"For the sake of my parents with many children, I became a geisha and, following the rules of that society, lived by taking patrons. However, I never had a pregnancy or anything, yet with the first night with you, I became pregnant immediately."

**The Three Runaway Wives**
**Story by Yasuko Den**
**Art by Toshiyuki**

(1)
"I think I’m pregnant."
In the corner of a deserted, quiet café, Tsuyako spoke while casting a sidelong glance at Uichiro. 
Startled by this unexpected news, the man’s small eyes darted about in disbelief. Though thin, he possessed a sinewy strength. His features were small, with eyes as tiny as an elephant's that flickered with a fox-like cunning. 
"It must have happened that first time we were together," she added.
The café’s proprietress, sensing the weight of their hushed conversation, tactfully retreated to the far end of the counter to lose herself in a book.

Uichiro had been married for ten years, yet remained childless. His wife, Kikuyo, was a frail woman who menstruated but once a year. He felt he had been swindled by the matchmaker into marrying a "defective" woman, and thus justified his extramarital pursuits as the natural right of a healthy man. Yet, because Kikuyo was humble and devoted—crippled by guilt over her own perceived inadequacy—he told others he kept her out of a sense of duty, planning to provide for her until the end rather than divorcing her.
An orphan with no kin, Uichiro had clawed his way up from rickshaw puller to chauffeur, eventually exploiting the post-war inflationary chaos to become a minor kingpin in the black market. Now a dealer in second-hand clothes, he found himself yearning for a child, just like any ordinary man. Despite the brazen greed and guile that defined his forty years, he felt a genuine ease with Tsuyako.

Tsuyako was the daughter of a fellow clothes dealer. She had been a geisha in Hiroshima before moving to Korea, where she had lived a life of luxury under a wealthy patron. When the war ended, she repatriated to Japan and lived adrift. Her professional elegance and expert makeup made her a striking figure in the drab, unrefined world of the black market stalls. Having spent her life in a world where a woman’s body was her only currency, she found herself incapable of a quiet, solitary existence. Instead, she had used her seasoned charms to ensnare the now-prosperous Uichiro.
"I became a geisha to support my parents and many siblings," she said. "I lived the life expected of me, taking patrons as needed. But in all those years, I never once conceived. To think it happened with you on our very first night..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography:** The title uses a large, hand-drawn, brush-style font typical of popular "pulp" magazines of the era. The body text is set in a standard vertical orientation (tategaki).
*   **Layout:** The page is structured with a large illustration on the left and text wrapping around it on the right and bottom. 
*   **Illustration:** The artwork depicts a woman from behind, partially undressed or in a state of undress, which was a common visual hook for the "Kasutori" or "Romance" magazines of the post-war period to signal adult themes.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and author's name are prominent at the top right. The story begins with a numbered section "(1)", indicating a serialized or multi-part narrative.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "( 58 )" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is a feature story within a larger compilation or magazine.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War "Kasutori" Culture:** The 1940s and 50s in Japan saw a boom in cheap, sensationalist magazines known as *Kasutori*. They often focused on sex, crime, and the gritty realities of post-war life.
*   **Yamiya (Black Marketeers):** The protagonist, Uichiro, is a "yamiya." After WWII, the collapse of the official economy made black markets the center of survival. Those who succeeded there were often viewed with a mix of envy and disdain.
*   **Repatriation (Hikiage):** Tsuyako is a repatriate from Korea ("Chosen"). Millions of Japanese moved back to the home islands ("Naichi") after the empire collapsed in 1945, often finding themselves destitute and forced into marginal professions like the black market or sex work.
*   **Geisha and Patrons:** The mention of Tsuyako's past as a geisha in Hiroshima and her "patron" in Korea reflects the precarious social position of women in the "flower and willow world" of that era.
*   **Infertility and Social Stigma:** The text describes the wife as "defective" because she cannot conceive, reflecting a period when a woman's primary social value was often tied to her reproductive capability.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ながし眼 (Nagashime):** A sidelong glance, often implying flirtation or hidden intent.
*   **ヤミ屋 (Yamiya):** Black market dealer. From *yami* (darkness/illegal).
*   **内地 (Naichi):** "Internal land," referring to the Japanese home islands as opposed to the former colonies (Korea, Taiwan, Manchuria).
*   **手練 (Shuren):** Skill or artifice. In this context, it refers to the seductive techniques Tsuyako learned as a geisha.
*   **飼殺し (Kaigoroshi):** Literally "to feed and kill." It means to keep someone (like a servant or a wife one no longer loves) in a position where they are provided for but have no future, freedom, or meaningful role.
*   **ヤミ肥り (Yamibutori):** "Black-market fat." A derogatory term for someone who grew wealthy and well-fed through illegal trade while others starved.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Moral Ambiguity:** Uichiro is not a "hero" in the traditional sense; he is a cunning opportunist who feels entitled to an affair because his wife is sickly. 
*   **Desperation and Survival:** Both characters are survivors of the war's aftermath. Their relationship is built on a mixture of mutual need and the "skills" they acquired to survive in harsh social environments.
*   **Fertility vs. Frailty:** The contrast between the sickly, "defective" wife and the vibrant, now-pregnant mistress creates the central conflict. The unexpected pregnancy serves as a catalyst for a man who has achieved financial success but lacks a legacy.
*   **Post-War Disillusionment:** The setting (black market, cheap cafes) and the characters' backgrounds (orphan, repatriated geisha) reflect the fragmented, displaced nature of Japanese society following the defeat.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Serial Novel.
*   **Genre:** Drama, Romance, Pulp Fiction (Kasutori).
*   **Themes:** Infidelity, Post-war Japan, Social Class, Pregnancy, Repatriation, Black Market.
