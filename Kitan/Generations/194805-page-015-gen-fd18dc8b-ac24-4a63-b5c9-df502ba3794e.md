今川かおる

私が女学校を卒業した翌年だったでしょうか、私が十九の時だったでしょうか、私は別にその男を心から好きと言うのでもなかったのですが、何となく異性を思慕する念と、強いセンチメンタルな年頃の少女として、ただ手紙のやりとりで知り合ったKと何かの分別もなく交際するようになったのでした。五月の或る夜、Kとその猛友と天王寺の五歩の中、その裸の婦像の異臭は若い女を専有したものでした。男と言うよりも私は一度にKに対する愛の芽を摘み取られた気持ちで、その後男性に対する愛の深さが生まれたのは確かでした。

そしてその後H氏という男との平凡な見合いをしました。見合いの後で暫く交際する期間が続き、その交際期間中の私の隈なく親切な態度には、一つはK以上にも映った彼に示されたこれ以外に私に尊敬時代の教師以上の尊敬と、これ迄にない愛情をかき立ててくれました。
私はこんな立派な奥さんに、もうなれるかと思うと、もう五つの日の長さを味わい、どんな胸のくびれと毎朝うずく様な日の長さを味わい、どんな事にして今となった私の胸にチクリと**非女感**という苦悩の塊は、非女の立場での証しで、H氏に対して、私の知らぬ同僚の男に、何かの知識を得る手段として、そう言ったのを、私がこうした切ない望みだと言う。しかし私にはそれはやはり無駄ではないと言う。

一切の純粋な白体を、惜しげもなく捧げることこそ無上の喜びであり、その上、惚れた身の弱さでとでも言うのでしょうか。もし結婚後、私の身の処女でないことが見破られ、破れた処女を目を見なければならなくなった場合の心配も湧き上り、極端な喜びと苦しみが、交互に私をさいなむ。
こんな事柄だが現に兄に相談するという友達の佐津子さんと、ニヤニヤ、私の打ち明け話をした。佐津子さんは兄を忍んで一切を打ち明けました。大体佐津子さんというのは、女学校時代に真っ先に婚前開発のゴールインだった人です。

聞く経緯で、私の知らぬ同僚の男に、何かの知識を得る手段として、そう言ったのを、私がこうした切ない望みだと言う。しかし私にはやはり無駄ではありません。佐津子さんは、私の打ち明け話をして、ニヤニヤ、私の気持ちの悪い笑いを言った。

「そしたら、即座に、御即座に、御即座に無用、何故かずっと早く相談にならなかったのよ。いやよ、この道の先生と思って、遠慮なくいらっしゃい。」
と言う。この前置きで彼女の語ったところは、余りに閨房の機微に耳を傾けるのもどうかと思う様な立場にあるが、一人でもそう言う人の苦悩を和らげる意味にもなって聴きます。事実はこの方法を佐津子さんに勧められて実行したたのでした。私の夫は私を完全な処女と思ってくれ、その後も理想的な夫婦生活を続けることが出来たでしょう。

方法と言うのは、まず薬局で明礬を買い求め、これを二、三十丸（錠）ばこれを越したことはありません。これを小さく砕いたてっぴりの、二、三合の合作。この薬品は手が掴ってください。取扱は結婚式日の五、六日前から塗り布する様な気持ちで、毎朝続けるとのです。これを妊婦のひきつけのように、凡ゆる点において処女と変わりなくなったのです。

以上が結婚日までの第一次措置でありますが、この洗濯の回数は、男と交際した回数に比例して増減を要することがあります。男と交際した回数と言うことは、それだけ地獄にて多いと言うことになるからです。
次の第二段階には、結婚初夜（初夜）の閨房の態度の、即ち花嫁の演技力に、凡ゆる点において処女と変わりような、その、現れを同時に自分を処女を失った時の心理状態と同じ苦痛を浮かせた時、その時状態と同じ苦痛とをもって、夫に訴えればよいのです。

**The Life of a Non-Woman**
Imagawa Kaoru

Was it the year after graduating from girl's school, was it when I was nineteen years old? I was not particularly in love with that man from the heart, but feeling a certain desire for the opposite sex, and as a strongly sentimental young girl, I became acquainted with K only through exchanging letters, and associated without distinction. One night in May, with K and his fierce friend, within the five steps of Tennoji, the strange smell of the naked female statue in Tennoji Park, monopolized the young woman. Rather than saying 'man,' I felt that the sprouts of love for K were crushed at once, and afterwards, the depth of love for men definitely arose.

And after that, I had an ordinary *miai* (arranged meeting) with a man named H. After the *miai*, a period of temporary association continued. During that period, my thorough kindness reflected more than K, shown to him, besides this, the respect higher than teachers of my respected era, and a love never before seen were stirred up for me.

Thinking, 'Will I really become such a fine wife?' I experience the length of the Five-Sun days, and the length of the days that throb every morning with a certain curve of the chest. The clump of anguish called 'Hijo-kan' (Non-Woman Feeling) that now pierces my chest is proof of being in the position of a Non-Woman. I told H that I wanted this painful thing as a means to gain knowledge from a colleague man H did not know. But I thought, 'It will be useless for me after all.'

To offer a completely pure white body, without regret, is the supreme joy, and furthermore, perhaps due to the weakness of being infatuated. If after marriage, the fact that I am not a virgin is discovered, and I am forced to look at myself as a broken virgin, worry arises, and extreme joy and agony alternately torment me. This matter, which I consulted with my friend Satsuko, who currently consults with her brother, Satsuko, laughing mischievously, confessed everything, keeping her brother secret. Satsuko, generally speaking, was the one who achieved the pre-marital development goal first during girl's school.

The circumstances heard: that I told H that I wanted this painful thing as a means to gain knowledge from a colleague man H did not know, was my painful desire. But I thought, 'It will be useless for me after all.' Satsuko, when I confessed to her, gave a knowing, unpleasant laugh.

"Then, immediately, immediately, immediately it was useless, why didn't you consult sooner? No, no, thinking of me as a teacher of this path, please come without reserve."
She said. Although her opening remarks put one in a position where listening to the subtleties of the bridal chamber feels inappropriate, I listen because it means comforting the anguish of even one such person.

The fact is, I carried out the method recommended by Satsuko. My husband believed I was a complete virgin, and we were able to continue an ideal married life thereafter.

The method is: first buy Alum (*myōban*) at the pharmacy, two or three tens of pills—never more than this. Crush this into small pieces, mixed with two or three measures of fine powder. This medicine must be held in the hand. The treatment is continued every morning, applied like a plaster starting five or six days before the wedding day. This makes one seem like a virgin in all aspects, like a pregnant woman experiencing convulsions.

This covers the First Stage procedures leading up to the wedding day. The number of 'washings' required must be increased or decreased in proportion to the number of times one has engaged in intercourse with a man. The number of times of intercourse means that much more hell one must endure.

The next second stage, during the bridal chamber behavior on the wedding night (first night), namely, in the bride's performance ability, when she simultaneously projects the same pain as the psychological state of losing her virginity, and with that same pain, she should appeal to her husband.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

P. Lady suddenly seized my lighter. No one questioned it. Perhaps a cigarette was held between his teeth every time, right under the man’s nose. Mr. Y. had no steady job, but he supported P.O.L.P. Lady in Osaka as a bar dancer. (16)

This serialized confession concerns the wife, P.L.P. Lady, a dancer/hostess who held no formal position other than her work at P.L.P.

**The Life of a Non-Woman**
By Kaoru Imagawa

Was it the year after I graduated from girls' school, or when I was nineteen? I didn't truly love him from the heart. But driven by a vague yearning for the opposite sex and being a strongly sentimental young girl, I began seeing K, whom I had only met through exchanging letters, without any regard for the consequences. One night in May, the strange, distinct odor of the naked female statue in Tennoji Park—shared by K and his rough friend—seemed to possess the young woman (me) within the five flights of Tennoji. Instead of developing feelings for him as a man, I felt the nascent sprouts of love for K crushed instantly. It is certain, however, that the true depth of love for men was born in me afterward.

Following that, I had an ordinary *miai* (arranged meeting) with a man named H. A period of dating followed. During this time, his unfailing kindness, which seemed far greater than anything K had shown, stirred up a respect higher than I held for the teachers of my school days, and a love I had never previously encountered.

Thinking, "Can I truly become such an exemplary wife?" I began to experience the duration of those anxious days, and the morning throbbing in my chest. The agonizing knot known as the **Non-Woman Feeling** (*Hijo-kan*) that now pierces my heart is proof of my status as a Non-Woman. I told H that I wanted to use this painful secret as a means to gain 'knowledge' from a colleague he didn't know. But I told myself that such an attempt would ultimately be futile.

To offer one's completely pure, untarnished white body without reservation—that is the supreme joy. But what if, due to the weakness born of infatuation, the truth of my non-virginity were discovered after marriage, forcing me to confront myself as a broken woman? Worry arose, and extreme joy and agony took turns tormenting me. I confided this matter to my friend Satsuko, who often consulted with her brother. Satsuko, with a knowing, mischievous smirk, revealed everything, keeping her brother’s secret. Satsuko, notably, was the one who had achieved the "pre-marital development goal" first back in our girls' school days.

She had heard the circumstances: that I told H I needed this knowledge from a man he didn't know, believing it was my only desperate hope. But I felt it would be pointless for me. When I confessed, Satsuko gave an unpleasant, knowing laugh.

"Then, immediately, immediately—it was useless! Why didn't you consult me sooner? No, no, think of me as a teacher in this field, and come without reservation."
She said that. While her introduction places the listener in a sensitive position concerning the subtleties of the bridal chamber, I am listening because it means alleviating the suffering of even one such person. The truth is, I carried out the method Satsuko recommended. My husband believed I was a perfect virgin, and we have been able to continue an ideal married life ever since.

The method is this: First, buy Alum (*myōban*) at a pharmacy—never more than two or three tens of pills. Crush this into small pieces and mix it with two or three measures of fine powder. This medicine must be handled manually. The treatment is continued every morning, applied like a plaster starting five or six days before the wedding day. This treatment ensures that in all respects, the woman appears like a virgin, similar to a pregnant woman experiencing convulsions.

This completes the First Stage procedures leading up to the wedding day. However, the number of these 'washings' must be increased or decreased in proportion to the number of times one has had intercourse with a man. The number of times you have had intercourse means that much more hell you must endure.

The Second Stage involves the intimate behavior of the wedding night (the first night). In the bride's performance, she must perfectly mimic the appearance of having lost her virginity in all aspects. At the moment she simultaneously projects the same pain as the psychological state she felt when she first lost her virginity, she must appeal to her husband using that same painful expression.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is a segment from a serialized narrative, likely a sensationalistic confession or fictionalized account, characteristic of post-war Japanese popular literature.

**Format and Structure:**
1.  **Layout:** Traditional Japanese vertical writing (*tategaki*), read from right to left.
2.  **Typography:** Printed in a relatively compact, older-style *Minchō* (serif) font. The use of older orthography (*rekishiteki kanazukai*) confirms the mid-Shōwa era setting.
3.  **Title and Hierarchy:** The title, **非女の生** (*Hijo no Sei*), is prominently displayed in large, bold font, establishing the central, provocative theme. The author's name, 今川かおる (Imagawa Kaoru), is centered below it.
4.  **Visual Element:** A small, explicit line drawing of a nude, reclining woman is positioned above the title, serving as a visual hook typical of sensational magazines or *kasutori bunka* (pulp literature).
5.  **Serial Context:** The rightmost column acts as a contextual framing device, introducing characters (P. Lady, Y. Mr.) and referencing the ongoing serialization with a parenthetical page number (一六 / 16).
6.  **Punctuation and Flow:** Punctuation is sparse compared to modern Japanese, relying heavily on commas (、) and full stops (。). Quotation marks (「 」) are used for dialogue, notably for the friend Satsuko's direct advice. Line breaks often signify shifts in topic or dramatic pauses. The number of 'washings' section uses internal mathematical logic (proportional increase) which is visually jarring but crucial to the meaning.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**The Shōwa Era Virginity Crisis:** This text directly addresses the extreme social pressure placed on Japanese women, particularly in the post-war period (1940s-1960s), to be virgins (*shojo*) upon marriage. Although Western influence brought liberalization, traditional views on purity remained strong, especially in arranged or socially prominent marriages (*miai*). The protagonist's initial relationship (K) is marked by youthful experimentation, which then becomes a source of extreme anguish when she enters a more respectable engagement (H).

***Hijo-kan* (非女感 / Non-Woman Feeling):** This neologism invented by the protagonist encapsulates the existential dread and sense of failure experienced by women who deviated from the societal ideal of purity. It suggests a feeling of being fundamentally defective or invalidated as a female member of society.

***Kasutori Bunka* (Pulp Culture):** This type of literature often appeared in cheap magazines and specialized serials during the impoverished immediate post-war period. Named after *kasutori* sake (cheap, often low-quality alcohol), this culture thrived on sensationalism, sexuality, confessions, and shocking stories, offering an escape and a candid look at social taboos, often blending fiction and purported "real-life" accounts.

**Faking Virginity (The Alum Method):** The detailed "remedy" using Alum (*myōban*) is a chilling historical detail. Alum is an astringent, and its use here suggests a pseudoscientific, desperate attempt to physically "correct" the body. The text justifies the extreme effort by stating the "hell" (地獄) one must endure, proportional to one's sexual history, serving as a moralistic justification for the pain required to maintain social standing.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **P・L・P・夫人 (P. L. P. fujin):** Likely an acronym or abbreviation for a specific location or type of establishment (e.g., a club or cabaret) where she worked as a dancer/hostess.
*   **強ひセンヂメンタル (Tsuyoi senchimentaru):** "Strongly sentimental." Uses the obsolete kana *hi* (ひ) for the modern *i* (い) in *tsuyoi*. The term *senchimentaru* (sentimental) is a direct, early loanword.
*   **天王寺の五歩 (Tennoji no goho):** "Five steps of Tennoji." Likely referring to a famous or atmospheric locale in Tennoji Park, Osaka, potentially a specific flight of steps, implying a secluded or evocative spot for the sexual encounter.
*   **裸の婦像の異臭 (Hadaka no fuzō no ishū):** "The strange smell of the naked female statue." Highly evocative, sensory, and slightly repulsive imagery, suggesting a link between public art, sexuality, and the protagonist’s emotional crushing.
*   **五つの日の長さ (Itsutsu no hi no nagasa):** Vague, possibly metaphorical phrase. *Itsutsu* (五つ) is five (units). *Hi* (日) is day. Contextually, it seems to refer to a measurement of time or anticipation linked to her anxiety over her body status.
*   **処女 (Shojo):** Virgin. The core concept around which the entire narrative revolves.
*   **明礬 (Myōban):** Alum (potassium aluminum sulfate). A common astringent chemical, used here in a home remedy context to physically tighten tissue, simulating the effect of virginity, reflecting desperation and folk medicine.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**The Performance of Womanhood:** The central theme is that womanhood, specifically the status of a respectable wife, is a theatrical performance. The bride must possess "performance ability" (演技力 / *engiryoku*) on her wedding night to mimic the pain of losing her virginity—a pain she already experienced but must now re-enact. Her physical body is not enough; her psychological state must be manufactured.

**Moralizing and Sensationalism:** The text walks a fine line between providing sensational, detailed instructions on sexual deception and applying a harsh moral judgment. The necessity of increasing the "washings" in proportion to past sexual partners, resulting in "that much more hell" (*jigoku*), acts as a deterrent and a moralistic footnote, simultaneously satisfying the reader's desire for scandalous details and societal desire for punishment/atonement.

**The Cynical Friend:** Satsuko embodies the modern, pragmatic woman who understands the system's flaws. Her "unpleasant, knowing laugh" suggests a cynical acceptance of the need for deception to survive patriarchal norms. She is the expert in "pre-marital development" (pre-marital sex) and, thus, the expert in concealing its consequences.
