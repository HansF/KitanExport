## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

男は、歯切れのよい啖呵に、自分ながら、惚れ〜と、にやりとして
「そろ〜おみこしを上げようか」
「大倉さん、それでは、あんまりー」
躰の緊張を少し和らげた信二に、気を許し、手を離して、その手を伸ばし、引き止めながら、
「まあお掛け下さいませ、これツ、信二ッあやまりなさいッ」
「嫌ですッ」
「いいですよ、奥さん、わつしゃ、気狂いの相手は真つ平ですからな、ぢゃご免下さい」
どうだ、こういう啖呵は、ちょっと切れめえといいたげに、大倉は顔をほころばせ、垂れた両手を握りながら、
膝を屈めて、ひょい〜と信二のうしろを廻り、舌打ちして、行きかけると、胸筋を、ピクシと震わせ、歯を喰いしばり、つか〜と長火鉢へ寄つた信二荒々しく、ひきだしを抜き、何か掴んだ。と
「待てッ」
おや？ と腰を屈めて信二をみていた大倉の胸元へ、檻を破つた豹のように、さつと飛びこんだ。高く上げた右手が、大きく半円を描いて大倉の腹の辺りへ流星のようにチカツとひらめいた。
「うーわあーッ」
獣のような鋭い叫びが起つて、屈んでいた大倉の躰が、大きくのけぞり、それに、信二が、しがみついてのしかかり、ドサッと大きな音をたて、折重つて倒れた。
「ひえーッ」ともなんともつかぬ叫びをあげる母が、大倉の上へのしかかつた信二の躰に飛びつき
「信二ッー！」
と信二の右手にしがみついて、裾をはだけ、足を突きつ張り必死の力で、ひつ張つた余力で後へ、どさツと引つくらかえつた。その上へ、信二が、仰向けに、血の垂れた剃刀を高く上げ、握りしめた、手も、鼠色の服の肘まで、べっとり血を浴びてー。
大倉は、けもののように吠えて、腹を抑え、着物も、畳も、血に染めながらのたうち廻つた。
「ひ、ひとごろしぃッー」
でん、とのつかつた信二を、必死に拂いのけて、母は、死にもの狂いの大倉に、しがみつき
「大倉さんッー」
かばつと跳ね起きた信二は、
ダダダッーと、夢中で、表へ飛び出した。

四、血ッ血だあ！

信二の心は動顛していたけれど、湊町の、四つ角のポストの傍にある魚屋と、光子がいつた言葉を考えていたらしく、いつの間にか、街燈のポツリとししかない暗い、ひつそりした四つ角にきていた。
ポストがある。ここだ。と傍の家を仰ぐと、大きな看板に、魚傅、と書いてあるのが、ぼんやり見える。
締めきった入口の柱に、へばりついて表札を覗くと
ああ、大倉傳三と書いてあるのだ。
「しまつたッー大倉」大倉といつでああッー」
殺した時も、逃げたときも、無我夢中だつたが、いま、始めて、天地がぐる〜と廻転したような、大きな衝撃を感じた。
おおッー こともあろうに、あの可愛い、光子の親父を殺すとはー。
ど、ど、どうすれば、いいんだッーどうすればー。
刑事、手錠、薄暗い牢舎、よれ〜の赤い着物、縄綯、刑場ー。
おおッ、死、死刑だッー！た、助けてくれッー！
咽喉をかきむしり、髪を引きちぎらんばかりに掴み、恐怖に思いきり、口を開けて身震いしたかと思うと、へな〜と冷めたい大地にしやがみこみ、うおう、うおうと吠えるように、声を殺して、泣いた。
なんだろう？ー。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The man, at [his own] crisp taunt, by himself, infatuation-ly, grinned and [said],
"Slowly-slowly, shall [I] lift the palanquin (leave)?"
"Okura-san, that is, too much—"
To Shinji who relaxed [his] body's tension a little, [she] let down [her] guard, released [his] hand, extended that hand, while stopping [him],
"Well, please sit, hey, Shinji, apologize!"
"I refuse!"
"It is fine, Madam. I, madman's partner-ing is flatly [refused], so, well, excuse me."
How is it, this kind of taunt, as if wanting to say [it's] a bit sharp, Okura softened [his] face, while gripping [his] hanging both hands, bent [his] knees, lightly-ly turned behind Shinji, clicked [his] tongue, and as [he] started to go, [his] chest muscles, twitch-ingly trembled, [his] teeth clenched, stomp-ingly Shinji who approached the long-hibachi, roughly, pulled out a drawer, and grabbed something. And
"Wait!"
Oh? and to the chest of Okura who was looking at Shinji with bent waist, like a leopard that broke a cage, [he] suddenly jumped in. The highly raised right hand, drawing a large semi-circle, toward the area of Okura's belly, like a meteor, flash-ingly glinted.
"U-waa-!"
A beast-like sharp scream rose, and the body of Okura who was crouching, greatly leaned back, and to that, Shinji, clinging and leaning over, with a 'thud' made a big sound, and fell overlapping.
"Hie-!" or some indistinguishable scream giving mother, at Shinji's body who leaned over on top of Okura jumped and
"Shinji-!"
and clinging to Shinji's right hand, [her] hem disheveled, legs braced with desperate strength, by the leftover force of pulling, backward, with a 'thud' flipped over. Onto that, Shinji, face-up, highly raising a blood-dripping razor, the gripped hand also, until the elbow of the mouse-colored clothes, sticky-ly was bathed in blood—.
Okura, like a beast barked, holding [his] belly, kimono also, tatami also, while staining with blood, writhed around.
"Mu, murderer—!"
'Den', the Shinji who was on top, desperately brushing off, the mother, to the death-crazed Okura, clung and
"Okura-san—!"
'Kaba', Shinji who sprang up,
'Da-da-da', in a trance, jumped out to the front.

Four: Blood, It's Blood!

Shinji's heart was upset, but, Minato-machi's, the fish shop near the post at the four-corners, and the words Mitsuko said seemed to be thinking about, before [he] knew it, at a dark, quiet four-corners where only a streetlamp was [there] lonely-ly, [he] had come.
There is a post. Here it is. and [he] looked up at the nearby house, on a big signboard, "Uoden", being written, [he] could dimly see.
To the pillar of the closed entrance, clinging and peeking at the nameplate
Ah, Okura Denzo, it is written.
"Damn— Okura, [he] said Okura and... ah—"
When [he] killed, when [he] fled, [he] was in a trance, but, now, for the first time, like heaven and earth turned 'guru-guru' (around), [he] felt a big shock.
Oh— of all things, that cute Mitsuko's father, to kill him—.
Ho, ho, how, should [I] do, it's okay— how—.
Detective, handcuffs, dim prison, frayed red clothes, rope-braiding, execution ground—.
Oh, death, it's the death penalty! He, help me—!
Tearing at [his] throat, grabbing [his] hair as if to pull it off, in fear to [his] heart's content, thinking [he] opened [his] mouth and shuddered, 'hena' (weakly) onto the cold earth [he] crouched, "Uou, uou" like barking, [he] killed [his] voice and cried.
What is it?—.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Grinning at the sharpness of his own retort, the man spoke with smug satisfaction. "Well then, I suppose it’s time I took my leave."

"Mr. Okura, please, that’s going too far—"

Sensing Shinji relax his guard, his mother let go of him and reached out to hold Okura back. "Please, stay a moment. Shinji! Apologize this instant!"

"No!" Shinji barked.

"It’s quite alright, ma'am," Okura said, his face softening with a look that suggested he was rather proud of his wit. "I have no desire to keep company with a madman. If you’ll excuse me."

As Okura gripped his hands at his sides, bent his knees, and moved to circle behind Shinji with a click of his tongue, Shinji’s chest muscles twitched. Gritting his teeth, he stomped toward the long charcoal brazier. With a violent motion, he yanked open a drawer and snatched something from within.

"Wait!"

Okura, sensing something was wrong, peered toward Shinji. In that instant, Shinji lunged at Okura’s chest like a leopard breaking from its cage. His right hand swung in a wide arc, and a flash—like a falling star—glinted across Okura’s midsection.

"Gwaaaaah!"

A sharp, beast-like shriek tore through the air. Okura’s crouching body recoiled violently. Shinji threw himself upon the man, and both crashed to the floor with a heavy thud.

"Hieee!" Shinji’s mother let out an incoherent scream and threw herself at Shinji’s back. "Shinji!"

She grabbed his right arm, her kimono hem flying, and pulled with every ounce of her strength. The momentum sent her tumbling backward. There stood Shinji, gasping for air, a blood-slicked razor held high in his hand. His arm was drenched in crimson up to the elbow of his gray shirt. 

Okura howled like a wounded animal, clutching his stomach as he writhed across the tatami, staining both his clothes and the mats a deep, wet red.

"Mu... murderer!"

The mother shoved Shinji aside and clung to the dying Okura. "Mr. Okura!"

Shinji scrambled to his feet and bolted out the door, his footsteps echoing into the night as he fled in a blind panic.

**IV. Blood, It's Blood!**

Shinji’s mind was a whirlwind of terror. He found himself wandering through the dark, quiet streets of Minato-machi until he reached a lonely intersection lit by a single, flickering streetlamp. He remembered the fish shop Mitsuko had mentioned, the one near the mailbox at the crossroads.

There was the mailbox. And there, looming in the shadows, was the house. He looked up at the large signboard: *Uoden*.

He crept to the closed entrance and peered at the nameplate on the pillar. 

*Okura Denzo.*

"No... Okura... he said his name was Okura..." 

The reality hit him with the force of a physical blow. During the struggle and the flight, he had been acting on pure instinct. But now, the world seemed to spin violently beneath his feet.

Of all people, he had killed him. He had killed the father of his beloved Mitsuko.

"What... what am I going to do?"

Visions of detectives, handcuffs, the dim light of a prison cell, the coarse red garb of a convict, the hangman’s rope, and the execution grounds flashed before his eyes.

"It’s the death penalty! God, help me!"

He clawed at his throat and tore at his hair. A shudder of pure, unadulterated terror racked his body. He collapsed onto the cold earth, let out a muffled, animalistic wail, and began to sob.

What had he done?

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows standard Japanese vertical layout (right-to-left). It features a large illustration at the top, occupying about one-third of the vertical space across the right and middle sections.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of Kanji and Hiragana, with some Katakana for onomatopoeia (like "チカツ" for a flash or "ダダダッ" for running). The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the section, "四、血ッ血だあ！" (Four: Blood, It's Blood!), serves as a clear break in the narrative, set in a larger or bolder typeface to signal a new chapter or scene change.
*   **Illustration:** The art style is characteristic of *Gekiga* or early post-war pulp illustrations. It uses heavy line work and cross-hatching to create a sense of drama and tension. The facial expressions are exaggerated—the man (Okura) looks smug, while the woman looks distressed.
*   **Punctuation:** Frequent use of tildes (〜) to indicate drawn-out sounds or emotional instability, and small "tsu" (ッ) to indicate abrupt, glottal stops or intense emotion in speech.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War 1940s-50s):** The setting and language reflect the "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense) influence that remained popular in pulp magazines (*kasutori* magazines) after the war. These stories often focused on crime, passion, and tragic fate.
*   **Nagahibachi (長火鉢):** A long charcoal brazier, a common household item in Japanese homes until the mid-20th century. It often had drawers for small items (like the razor Shinji used).
*   **Shaving Razor (剃刀 - Kamisor):** Before safety razors became universal, straight razors were common. In pulp fiction, they were a frequent choice for a "weapon of opportunity" in domestic disputes.
*   **Social Class/Dialect:** Okura uses "Wassha" (わっしゃ), a colloquial/dialectal version of "Watashi" (I), often associated with older men or specific regional dialects (like Nagoya or parts of Kyushu), or simply used to denote a "rough" or "down-to-earth" character.
*   **Prison Imagery:** The "red clothes" (赤い着物) refers to the traditional prison uniform used in Japan during the Meiji through early Showa periods (red was used to make escapees easier to spot).

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **啖呵 (Tanka):** Sharp, biting words or a "tough guy" retort. Often associated with merchants or *yakuza* in traditional storytelling.
*   **おみこしを上げる (Omikoshi o ageru):** Literally "to lift the palanquin." Idiomatically, it means to stand up and leave, especially after a long stay.
*   **動顛 (Doten):** To be turned upside down; to be extremely upset or panicked.
*   **無我夢中 (Muga muchu):** Being in a trance; doing something frantically without being aware of one's actions.
*   **魚傅 (Uoden):** A typical name for a fish shop, combining "Fish" (魚) with a character from the owner's name (傳 - Den).
*   **縄綯 (Nawanai):** Traditional rope-making/braiding. In a prison context, it refers to the forced labor prisoners often performed.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Tragic Irony:** The core of the drama is the revelation that the man Shinji murdered is the father of the woman he loves (Mitsuko). This "star-crossed" tragedy is a staple of Japanese melodrama.
*   **The "Beast" Within:** The text repeatedly compares the characters to animals ("like a leopard," "like a beast"). This suggests a theme of losing one's humanity to primal rage or fear.
*   **Fatalism:** Shinji’s immediate leap to thoughts of the death penalty and the execution ground reflects a fatalistic worldview common in Noir literature, where a single mistake leads inevitably to total destruction.
*   **Class and Conflict:** The tension between the "madman" (the impulsive youth) and the "smug man" (the established elder) hints at generational or social friction.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Novel, Noir, Crime Drama.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Violence, Murder, Tragedy, Regret, Post-war Japan, Melodrama.
*   **Classification:** Mature (depicts a stabbing and graphic emotional distress).
