「青空晴子さん――一体瀧子が何を
したのでしよう？」
「お兄さんにはお気の毒ですが、
津田美代子殺害犯人として、野々村
瀧子さんを送局したいのです」
「えッ？」
「さつき私が来た時、瀧子さんは
そこに火鉢があるのに電熱でお茶を
沸しましたね、その火鉢は多分もう
使つていられないのでしよう。所が
少し灰がこぼれているのは、その火
鉢から火箸を抜取つたからなのです。そ
の上この火箸のさし方は一方が浅く
一方が深く、非常に不自然ですね。
これは二本一度に差したのではな
く、一本だけを後から差したからで
す。それはこの灰の穴でも分ります
ね。この深い方を抜いてみましょ
う。殆ど灰は着いていません。それ

　晴子がその火箸に手を触れた時、
瀧子はギヨツとしたように眸を磨いで
いた。
「こんなにベツトリ灰がついてい
ます。何故でしよう。それは濡れた
まま灰の中え差したからです。では
何故濡れたのでしよう。この火箸に
血が着いていたのです。この火箸と
灰から、美代子さんと同じ血液型の
血はすぐ採取出来るでしよう。これ
が恐ろしい兇器だつたのです。
　それからそこに脱いである足袋の

便所に居た山野君が足音を聞かなか
つた謎も分りますね。」
　瀧子さんは寝る前に便所へ行くと
いって、向い室へ行つたのです。
そうでないければ便所で山野君に会つ
た筈ですが、誰も人影は見えなかつ
たとさつき言いましたね。そこで
も話の喰違いはあるわけです。又恐
らくその着物には何所かに血痕が附
着している筈です。
　これだけ言えば、まだ犯人は私ち
やないとは言えないでしよう。お医
者様でも草津の湯でも何とやら、さ
ても戀に狂つた一念つて恐ろしいも
のですね。私もそんな戀がしてみたい
いですわ。ほほ……」
　その時警官隊が玄関へ乗込んで来

「晴子さん、お手敷かけてすみま

でした。こんな妹は居なかつたもの
と思つて諦めて頂戴。それぢや御氣
嫌ようね」
　そう言い乍ら悔悟の涙ボロボロこ
ぼして居た。

「こんなにべっとり灰がついています。なぜでしょう。それは濡れたまま灰の中へ刺したからです。ではなぜ濡れたのでしょう。この火箸に血がついていたのです。この火箸と灰から、美代子さんと同じ血液型の血はすぐ採取できるでしょう。これが恐ろしい凶器だったのです。
　それからそこに脱いである足袋の裏は非常に汚れているばかりか、赤い土がついています。このアパートで赤土の所は裏の中庭だけですが、瀧子さんはそこを足袋裸足になって歩いた事になるのです。つまり隣の棟の裏扉から入ったのですが、これで便所にいた山野君が足音を聞かなかった謎も分かりますね。」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Detective Story]**
"Aozora Haruko-san—What on earth did Takiko do?"
"It is a pity for the older brother, but as the culprit of the Tsuda Miyoko murder, I wish to send Nonomura Takiko-san to the station."
"Eh?"
"Earlier when I came, Takiko-san, even though a hibachi was there, you boiled tea with electric heat, didn't you? That hibachi probably is no longer usable. However, the reason a little ash is spilled is because from that hibachi the fire-chopsticks were pulled out. Furthermore, this way of sticking the fire-chopsticks is one side shallow and one side deep; it is very unnatural. This was not sticking two at once, but only one was stuck in later. That can be understood even from these holes in the ash. Let us try pulling this deep one. Almost no ash is attached. That is because it had been stuck for a long time. Next, let us pull the shallow one."
When Haruko touched those fire-chopsticks, Takiko, as if startled, was opening her eyes wide.
"Ash is sticking thickly like this. Why? It is because while wet, it was stuck into the ash. Then why was it wet? Blood was attached to these fire-chopsticks. From these fire-chopsticks and ash, blood of the same type as Miyoko-san can soon be collected. This was the terrifying murder weapon.
Furthermore, the soles of the tabi socks taken off there are not only very dirty, but red soil is attached. In this apartment, the place with red soil is only the back courtyard, but it means Takiko-san walked there in her tabi-clad feet. In other words, she entered from the back door of the next wing; by this, the mystery of why Yamano-kun, who was in the toilet, did not hear footsteps is also understood."
"Takiko-san, saying she would go to the toilet before sleeping, went to the opposite room. If not, she should have met Yamano-kun in the toilet, but you said earlier that no human figure was seen. There also, a contradiction in the story exists. Also, probably on that kimono, somewhere bloodstains must be adhering. If I say this much, you probably cannot say the culprit is not me yet. 'Even doctors or the waters of Kusatsu [cannot cure love],' or something like that; indeed, a single-mindedness crazed by love is a terrifying thing. I would like to try such a love too. Ho-ho..."
At that time, the sound of the police force's footsteps entering the entrance was heard. Takiko, having finished putting on her kimono, as if having resigned herself, sat in seiza there and said,
"Haruko-san, I am sorry for causing trouble. Brother, Takiko was a bad woman. Please give up on me, thinking such a sister did not exist. Well then, farewell."
While saying so, she was spilling tears of repentance.

**[Essay: Woman of Spring]**
Woman of Spring
By Fuji
The time women look most beautiful, in a year, spring would be first.
Shedding the haori, or throwing away the overcoat, the beauty and glossiness of the gallant girl who walks/swims through streets and fields while bathed in the spotlight vividly—that silent "sex motion" that does not stop until it fascinates the opposite sex is surely first in spring.
The curves of the waist vaguely wrapped in a serge hitoe—because they are not openly seen, the allure is all the more great.
The time Western-dressed women increase their beauty further is also the spring streets. On the city pavements, every time the warmth increases, beautiful Western clothes, while exposing bursting "sex lines," walk bravely.
O men, walk with eyes closed; it is the spring streets. Even without drinking a ten-yen cup of coffee, the beauty of women can be tasted to one’s heart’s content on the roadside.
O women of spring, walk gallantly on the pavement.

**[The Detective Case]**
"Miss Haruko Aozora—tell me, what has Takiko done?"
"I feel for you, as her brother," Haruko replied gravely, "but I must turn Miss Takiko Nonomura over to the authorities as the prime suspect in the murder of Miyoko Tsuda."
"What?"
"When I arrived earlier, Takiko used an electric heater to boil tea despite a hibachi sitting right there. That brazier is likely out of use now. However, I noticed a spill of ash—the result of someone hastily pulling out the fire tongs. Look at how they were replaced: one is deep, the other shallow. It’s highly unnatural. They weren't put back together; one was shoved in later. The holes in the ash tell the story. If I pull out the deep one... see? Hardly any ash clings to it because it had been sitting there for ages. Now, let’s look at the shallow one."
As Haruko reached for the tongs, Takiko’s eyes widened in a sudden flash of panic.
"Look at how the ash is caked on this one. Why? Because it was thrust into the brazier while still wet. And why was it wet? Because it was slick with blood. We will surely find blood of the same type as Miyoko’s on these tongs and in this ash. This was the gruesome murder weapon.
Furthermore, the soles of those discarded tabi are filthy and stained with red clay. The only place in this apartment complex with red clay is the rear courtyard. This proves Takiko walked through it in her socks. She must have slipped in through the back door of the adjacent wing, which explains why Yamano, who was in the restroom at the time, heard no footsteps."
"Takiko claimed she was going to the restroom before bed, yet she headed for the room across the hall. If she had gone to the restroom, she would have run into Yamano, who specifically said he saw no one. Her story doesn't hold up. I suspect we’ll find bloodstains on her kimono as well. Given all this, you can hardly maintain your innocence. As the saying goes, 'neither doctors nor the springs of Kusatsu can cure the sickness of love.' A heart driven mad by obsession is a terrifying thing indeed. Though, I must admit, I wouldn't mind experiencing such a passion myself. Ho-ho..."
Just then, the heavy tread of the police echoed through the entryway. Takiko, having finished dressing and appearing resigned to her fate, sat formally on the floor.
"Miss Haruko, I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. Brother... Takiko was a wicked woman. Please, just forget I ever existed. Farewell."
Tears of genuine remorse streamed down her face as she spoke.

**[Essay: The Women of Spring]**
**Woman of Spring**
*By Fuji*
There is no season in the year when a woman appears more radiant than in the spring.
Shedding their heavy haori and casting aside their winter overcoats, young women take to the streets and the hills, basking in the sunlight with a gallant, lively grace. Their beauty and luster create a silent "sex motion"—an allure so potent it seems designed solely to captivate the opposite sex. Spring is truly their stage.
The curves of a waist draped in a light serge robe offer a tantalizing glimpse; it is precisely because they are not fully revealed that the charm is so profound.
It is on the springtime streets that women in Western dress truly come into their own. As the days grow warmer, the pavements are filled with women walking boldly, their fashionable Western clothes accentuating "sex lines" that seem almost ready to burst with life.
O, men! You had best walk with your eyes closed, for this is the spring city. Even without the luxury of a ten-yen cup of coffee, one can feast upon the beauty of these women right there on the roadside.
O, women of spring! Walk proudly upon the pavement.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The page is divided into two distinct editorial zones. The right side and top-left finish a narrative story, while the bottom-left contains an unrelated descriptive essay. 
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of traditional Kanji (Kyūjitai) and modernizing elements. The use of "Ho-ho..." (ほほ……) and the detective's flirtatious/confident tone at the end of a murder reveal is typical of the *ero-guro-nansenpu* (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) or the popular detective magazines of the era.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "春の女" (Woman of Spring) is centered with decorative dots, distinguishing it as a new section. The detective story concludes with a parenthetical note.
*   **Illustration:** A small, stylized drawing in the bottom left shows a woman's leg and high heel, emphasizing the "Western dress" and "sex line" themes mentioned in the essay.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s - Early 1950s):** Several clues point to this period. The price of "10 yen coffee" suggests the early post-war period (in the 1930s it was cheaper; by the mid-50s it rose). The mention of "Western dress" (洋装 - yōsō) vs. "Kimono/Haori" reflects the rapid transition in women's fashion after WWII.
*   **Aozora Haruko:** This appears to be a "female detective" (女探偵 - onna tantei) series. Female detectives were popular in post-war pulp magazines (like *Hōseki* or *Messenger*).
*   **Forensics:** The mention of "blood type" (血液型) as a key piece of evidence shows the mid-century fascination with scientific detection.
*   **Kusatsu no Yu:** The phrase "お医者様でも草津の湯でも (何とやら)" refers to the folk song *Kusatsu Bushi*, which claims the famous hot springs can cure any ailment *except* for the sickness of love (惚れた病は治りゃせぬ).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **送局 (Sōkyoku):** To send a suspect to the prosecutor's office/police station.
*   **火箸 (Hibashi):** Metal tongs used for handling charcoal in a hibachi.
*   **足袋はだし (Tabi-hadashi):** Being in one's socks (tabi) without shoes/sandals, often implying haste or secrecy.
*   **セツクス・モーション (Sex Motion):** A wasei-eigo (Japanese-made English) term of the era, referring to sexual appeal or suggestive movement.
*   **セツクス・ライン (Sex Line):** Similar to "body lines" or "curves," specifically highlighting the silhouette of the female body in tight Western clothing.
*   **セル (Seru):** Serge, a type of durable twill fabric popular for student uniforms and light kimonos (*hitoe*).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Modernity vs. Tradition:** The detective story features a hibachi (traditional) but the murder is solved by a modern woman detective. The essay contrasts traditional *haori* with *yōsō* (Western clothes), celebrating the "brave" and "gallant" look of modern women.
*   **Voyeurism & The Male Gaze:** The "Woman of Spring" essay is explicitly written for a male audience, encouraging them to "taste" the beauty of women on the street. It reflects the "liberated" but still highly objectifying post-war attitude toward female sexuality.
*   **Repentance (Kaigo):** The murderer Takiko follows a classic trope of the "fallen woman" who repents through tears and formal *seiza* once caught, reinforcing moral social order.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Detective Mystery), Essay (Lifestlye/Style).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Crime, Post-war Japan, Fashion, Female Detective, Urban Life, Eroticism (mild), Mystery.
