と、たわいにはあつさり止めて貰わなくちや、こちらがたまりませんわよ」
「――そうだな」
　アハマはもう一度聞き耳を立てたが、何も音がしないのであきらめて妻の顔をみた。そして、結婚式の日に新しく買つた純白のシーツの上に、ふわわくりくぼみを作つている妻の裸身を、つくづくと眺めた。
　そのときである、突然、夜のしじまを破つて、隣家から、キャーッ、と、たゞならぬ女の叫び聲が起つた。アハマも妻もピタッ、と息を止めて耳をそばだてた。男の荒々しい叫びと絶叫する女の悲鳴に混つて、何かが投げつけられたような音がした。それから、肉体が、壁や床に打ちつかる音がいつになく激しさを以て響いてきた。
「どうしたんだろう、行つてみようか」
　アハマは呼吸を彈ませて言つた。
「でも――」
　そう言つて妻は熱つぽい頬をすり寄せてくる。
「アドー!! アドー!!」
　隣家から女の泣き聲が傳わつてきた。
「おい、あの聲が聞えんのか、只事じやないぞ、俺や、ちよつと行つてみてきてやる」
「いやッ――あんた、あんな女の顔、そんなにみたいの？」
「馬鹿言え」
「そんなら、凝としてなさいよ」
「しかし今日のは、どうも――」
「いゝぢやありませんか、あんな女、殺され……つて――」
　二人はいつしか眠りにおちていた。

「トアン、トアン（旦那）」
　自分を　ぶ聲にアハマはふと眼を覺ました。壁の透間から、太陽がまぶしく差し込んでいる。
「誰だろう」
　アハマは、ねむた眼をこすりながら、首をねじ曲げて言つた。
「俺だよ」
　その聲は、イマム（僧侶）の聲であつた。
「ちよつと待つてくれ、いま起きるから」
「早くしてくれ、大変なんだ」
　言葉がのんびりしているので、あまり大変らしく聞えなかつたが、アハマは、ハッと昨夜のことが頭をかすめたのでいよいよ何かあつたなと思つた。
「おい~~」
　と妻を起した。
「うーん」
　妻は、鼻にかゝつた甘つたるい聲を出して、汗ばんたからだを、ぐにやリとねじまげた、
「こりや~~、もう晝頃だぞ、早く起きろや」
　そう言うと妻は、やつと眼を開けてまぶしそうに陽ざしをみて
「嘘つき、まだ早いわよ」
　すると表の方からイマムの聲がして
「トアン~~早く起きてくれよ、離れにくいだろうが、もう十時だよ」
「よしッ直ぐ起きるから待つてくれ」
　そう言つて妻に
「昨夜なにか大変なことが起つたらしい、だイマムがこんなに早く起しにきたんだ、お前も起きろ」
　アハマは、ひとつ大きなあくびをして、ゆつくり起き上つた。
　妻も、仕方なしに半身を起し、肩や、頰にへばりついている亂れ手を両手で掻き上げながら
「タオル取つてちようだい」
と言つた。
　アハマは、傍の机に置いてある大きなバスタオルをとつて妻に渡し、自分も、からだを素早く拭いて立ち上ると、大きな腰巻のようなサロンを拡げて、頭からかむり、胸まで降ろすと手際よく輪になつた両端をつまんでピンと張り、前できっちり合わせて腰の所までくるゝと巻き下げて落ちぬように纒いつけた。
　そして、丸頸のメリヤスシャツを着その上に糊のきいた背廣の上衣をひつかけて仕切りのカーテンから出ると表戸を開けた。
　イマムも同じように、サロンの上に背廣の上衣だけを着た恰好で頭に真っ赤なビロードの背の高い、ひさしのない帽子を横つちよにかむり、のんびりと木の葉で巻いた煙草を喫つて立つていた。三十を越したばかりであるが、四十以上に見える、ふけた長たらしい顔をしている。
　アハマは、ちぢれた髪を邪魔くさそうにかき上げながら
「どうしたんだい？」
と言つて、透き通るようなコバルトの空に入道雲のような白雲が悠々と漂つている空を、まぶしそうに見上げた。
―知らなかつたのか、昨夜の騒ぎを
―一キロも　れたんちの家まで聞こえたあのデかい悲鳴を――」
「俺だつて、つんぼじやないぜ、いくら貰いたての女房と暮してたてつ気はたしかだからな。そう変な顔をしなさんな」
　アハマはそう言つて人の良さそうな

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"And, if the silliness isn't stopped quickly, it's unbearable for us."
"—That's true."
Ahama once more pricked up his ears, but since no sound happened, gave up and looked at his wife's face. And, on top of the pure white sheets newly bought on the wedding day, he gazed intently at his wife's naked body, which was making a soft hollow.
It was at that time; suddenly, breaking the night's silence, from the neighboring house, "Kyaa!" a woman's unusual scream arose. Both Ahama and his wife stopped their breath "snap" and strained their ears. Mixed with a man's rough shouting and a woman's shrieking scream, there was a sound like something being thrown. After that, the sound of a body striking walls and floors echoed with more intensity than usual.
"What happened, I wonder, shall I go and see?"
Ahama spoke while making his breathing bounce.
"But—"
Saying so, the wife brings her feverish cheek close to rub.
"Ador!! Ador!!"
From the neighboring house, a woman's crying voice traveled over.
"Hey, can't you hear that voice? It's not a trivial matter. I'll just go and see."
"No—you, that woman's face, do you want to see it that much?"
"Don't say stupid things."
"Then, stay still."
"But today's [noise] is somehow—"
"Isn't it fine? A woman like that, even if she's killed—"
The two of them, before they knew it, fell into sleep.

II

"Tuan, Tuan (Master)"
To the voice calling him, Ahama suddenly woke his eyes. Through the gaps in the wall, the sun was shining dazzlingly.
"Who is it?"
Ahama, while rubbing sleepy eyes, twisted his neck and spoke.
"It's me."
That voice was the voice of the Imam (priest).
"Wait a bit, I'm getting up now."
"Hurry up, it's a big deal."
Because the words were leisurely, it didn't sound like such a big deal, but Ahama, because last night's things flashed through his head, thought "finally something happened."
"Hey~~"
And he woke his wife.
"Ugh..."
The wife, letting out a sweet voice caught in her nose, twisted her sweat-dampened body in a "gunyari" limp way.
"Hey now, it's already around noon, wake up quickly."
When he said that, the wife finally opened her eyes and looked at the sunlight dazzlingly.
"Liar, it's still early."
Then from the front direction the Imam's voice came.
"Tuan~~ hurry and wake up, it must be hard to leave [the bed], but it's already ten o'clock."
"Alright, I'll get up immediately so wait."
Saying so to the wife:
"It seems something big happened last night. Now the Imam has come to wake me this early. You wake up too."
Ahama gave one big yawn and slowly rose up.
The wife also, by necessity, raised her half-body, and while brushing up with both hands the messy hair clinging to her shoulders and cheeks:
"Give me the towel please,"
she said.
Ahama took the large bath towel placed on the desk nearby and handed it to his wife, and himself, after quickly wiping his body and standing up, spread out a sarong like a large loincloth, put it over his head, lowered it to his chest, then skillfully pinched both ends that had become a loop, pulled them taut, matched them tightly in the front, and rolled it down to the waist "kuru-kuru" and wound it so it wouldn't fall.
And then, he put on a round-necked knit (meriyasu) shirt and over that threw on a starched suit jacket, and exiting through the partition curtain, opened the front door.
The Imam also, in the same way, in the style of wearing only a suit jacket over a sarong, wore a bright red velvet high, brimless hat sideways on his head, and was standing there leisurely smoking a cigarette rolled in a tree leaf. He had just passed thirty, but looked over forty, having a haggard, longish face.
Ahama, while brushing up his frizzy hair as if it were a nuisance:
"What happened?"
he said, and looked up dazzled at the sky where white clouds like summer clouds were drifting leisurely in the transparent cobalt sky.
"—Didn't you know? About last night's disturbance. That huge scream that was heard as far as my house a kilometer away—"
"Even me, I'm not deaf. Even if I'm living with a wife I just got, I've still got my wits about me. Don't make such a strange face."
Ahama said so, and his good-natured...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"And really, if you don’t put a stop to this nonsense, I simply won't be able to stand it."
"I suppose you're right."
Ahama strained his ears once more, but when only silence followed, he gave up and turned back to his wife. He gazed intently at her naked form as she lay nestled in the soft hollow of the pure white sheets they had bought for their wedding day.
It was then that a sudden, piercing shriek from next door shattered the silence of the night. Both Ahama and his wife froze, holding their breath. Mingled with the man’s feral shouting and the woman’s desperate screams came the sound of objects being hurled. Then came the thud of bodies slamming against the walls and floor with unprecedented violence.
"I wonder what's going on. Maybe I should go check?" Ahama asked, his breath hitching.
"But..." his wife murmured, pressing her warm cheek against his.
"Ador! Ador!"
The woman’s wailing from the neighboring house drifted through the walls.
"Hey, can’t you hear that? This is no ordinary quarrel. I’m going over there for a second."
"No! Do you really want to see that woman’s face that badly?"
"Don't be ridiculous."
"Then just stay put."
"But tonight seems... different."
"Who cares? A woman like that... let her be killed for all I care."
Before they knew it, the two had drifted back to sleep.

"Tuan! Tuan!"
Ahama was jolted awake by a voice calling for him. Dazzling sunlight streamed through the cracks in the wall.
"Who is it?" Ahama muttered, rubbing his sleepy eyes and craning his neck.
"It’s me."
It was the voice of the Imam.
"Hold on, I'm getting up."
"Hurry, it's serious."
The Imam sounded far too relaxed for it to be truly serious, but the memory of the previous night flashed through Ahama's mind, and he realized something must have happened after all.
"Hey, wake up," he said, nudging his wife.
"Mm..." She let out a sweet, nasal moan and languidly stretched her sweat-slicked body.
"Come on, it's nearly noon. Get up."
She finally opened her eyes, squinting against the light. "Liar, it's still early."
From outside, the Imam called out again. "Tuan! Hurry up and get out here. I know it’s hard to leave her, but it’s already ten o’clock!"
"Alright, I'm coming! Just wait!"
Turning back to his wife, he said, "Something happened last night. The Imam wouldn't be here this early otherwise. You get up too."
Ahama let out a massive yawn and slowly rose. His wife reluctantly sat up, using both hands to brush back the tangled hair clinging to her shoulders and cheeks.
"Pass me a towel," she said.
Ahama grabbed a large bath towel from the desk and handed it to her. He quickly wiped himself down, stood up, and unfolded a sarong. He slipped it over his head, lowered it to his chest, then expertly pulled the ends taut, folded them over the front, and rolled the top down to his waist until it was secure.
He pulled on a round-necked undershirt, threw a starched suit jacket over it, and pushed through the partition curtain to open the front door.
The Imam was dressed similarly, wearing a suit jacket over a sarong. On his head sat a tall, brimless hat of bright red velvet, perched at an angle. He stood there leisurely puffing on a cigarette rolled in a dry leaf. Though barely thirty, his haggard, elongated face made him look well over forty.
Ahama ran a hand through his frizzy hair. "So, what is it?" he asked, squinting up at the sky, where billowing white clouds drifted lazily through a transparent cobalt expanse.
"You didn't know? About the chaos last night? That scream was so loud I heard it at my house a kilometer away!"
"I'm not deaf," Ahama retorted. "Just because I'm a newlywed doesn't mean I've lost my senses. Don't look at me like that."
Ahama spoke with his usual good-natured...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is presented in a traditional Japanese vertical layout (tategaki), read from top-to-bottom and right-to-left. It is divided into two columns per page.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-20th-century printing. It uses *furigana* (reading aids) for certain kanji and specialized terms.
*   **Orthography:** The text uses some historical kana usage (*kyū-kanazukai*) and older kanji forms (*kyūjitai*), such as 聲 (voice) instead of 声 and 覺 (awake) instead of 覚. This indicates a publication date likely between the 1930s and early 1950s.
*   **Visual Elements:** An ink sketch occupies the lower right of the second column. It depicts a traditional stilt house (likely a *rumah panggung*) with a thatched roof and palm trees, clearly establishing a Southeast Asian setting.
*   **Sectioning:** The use of "二" (Two) centered between paragraphs indicates a chapter or scene break.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses standard Japanese quotation marks (「 」) and dashes (――) for emphasis or trailing speech. Tildes (~~) are used to indicate elongated vowels in speech, giving it a colloquial, lived-in feel.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Setting:** The setting is clearly the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) or British Malaya during the Japanese occupation or the era of "Nanyo" (South Seas) literature.
*   **Language & Honorifics:**
    *   **Tuan (トアン):** A Malay/Indonesian word for "master" or "sir." The Japanese text clarifies this with the gloss "(旦那)" (danna).
    *   **Imam (イマム):** A religious leader in Islam. The text glosses this as "(僧侶)" (sōryō/priest).
*   **Clothing:**
    *   **Sarong (サロン):** A traditional garment wrapped around the waist. The description of the protagonist putting it on over his head and rolling it at the waist is a very specific, authentic detail.
    *   **Suit Jacket & Sarong:** The combination of a Western-style suit jacket (*sebiro*) with a traditional sarong and a velvet hat (likely a *songkok* or *peci*) describes the formal/semi-formal attire of Southeast Asian men during that era.
    *   **Meriyasu (メリヤス):** Refers to knitted fabric, often used for undershirts.
*   **Historical Era:** This likely belongs to the "Greater East Asia" literary movement (approx. 1941–1945), where Japanese writers depicted life in occupied territories. The tone reflects a blend of colonial domesticity and the "raw" energy of the tropics.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **しじま (Shijima):** Silence; stillness. A poetic term often used in literature to describe the dead of night.
*   **只事 (Tadagoto):** An ordinary matter. Usually used in the negative ("只事じゃない") to mean something is serious or extraordinary.
*   **凝としてなさい (Jitto shitenasai):** Be still / Stay put.
*   **つんぼ (Tsunbo):** A now-taboo/discriminatory term for a deaf person. In this context, it is used colloquially to mean "I'm not hard of hearing."
*   **入道雲 (Nyūdōgumo):** Large, billowing cumulonimbus clouds, typical of summer or tropical climates.
*   **気はたしか (Ki wa tashika):** To be in one's right mind / to have one's wits about one.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Domesticity vs. Violence:** The contrast between the intimate, sensuous scene of the newlyweds in bed and the violent domestic abuse occurring next door creates a jarring atmosphere.
*   **The "Othering" of Neighbors:** The wife’s dismissive attitude toward the woman next door ("a woman like that") suggests social friction, perhaps based on class, morality, or ethnicity within the local community.
*   **The Languor of the Tropics:** The description of the heat, the sweat, the "sweet" voices, and the late wake-up call (10:00 AM being considered "late" but the Imam being "leisurely") emphasizes the stereotypical "Southern" atmosphere often depicted in Japanese literature of this period.
*   **Masculine Responsibility:** Ahama feels an instinctive need to investigate the violence, while his wife tries to restrain him through sexual/emotional manipulation.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Serialized Novel.
*   **Genre:** Colonial Literature (Nanyō Bungaku), Drama, Realism.
*   **Themes:** Marriage, Domestic Violence, Occupation-era Life, Southeast Asian Culture, Islam.
*   **Flags:** Contains period-appropriate but currently offensive terminology (*tsunbo*).
