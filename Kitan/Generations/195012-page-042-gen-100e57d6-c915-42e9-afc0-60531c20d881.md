## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

の男子、柔道又は拳闘の心得ある方に限る。日当りよき、二階二室、無料提供、略歴持参、当方、母嬢女中、小人数、家族的優遇、面談の事

　良太はその広告の中程から、ニヤリと北爽（ほくそう）に笑んで居た。丁度手頃な質問を探していた矢先でもあつたが、何より条件が気に入った。柔道初段は一寸心細いが、拳闘ならライト級で自信は大あり、ストレートパンチが得意なのだ。
　翌日、良太はその夕刊を握りしめて一番電車で広告の住所へ尋ねて行つた頃には、早くも二十三人の我こそは柔道×段、拳闘×級の猛者ばかりが列を作つて待つて居た。九時の面会時間迄には、凡そ二三十人の列になった。
何しろ住宅難の今日のことで、此の応募者の数には不思議はなかつた。これ等の男達も良太と同じく、ただ二階無料提供丈に魅力を感じているのではあるまいかもしれまい。多分彼等も母嬢？に魅力を感じていることだろうと、良太は考えるのである。
　貸間札、二階かします、おのぞみなれば、シタも貸します後家世帯……
良太はふと、春の週末旅行の温泉宿で課長が唄った都々逸を想い出して、俺は何といやしやつちやろ、一人で赧くなった。
　良太がピースの七本目に火を点けた頃、ようやく門が開いて、順番に先の者から応接室へ案内されていつた。
　彼は段々自信が無くなって来たが、でもどんな間違いでお鉢が廻つて来ないとも限らない。良太は、貸して貰える二階の部屋を想像するより、その母娘？なるものに早く逢つて見たいと思つた。
　態（な）りて彼の番が迫つて来ると、時間の暇々に読んでいた、例の性典と一冊の本を、急いで英字新聞で擬装した。応接室へ通された。
「どうぞ、お掛けになつて下さいな」
　やさしいチヤアミングな、世なれた声と共に、良太の前に美しい四十歳前後の婦人が立つて居る。期待をそらさぬ美人だつた。
「ハア」向い合つて座った。美しい夫人の後に、かくれるように十八歳ほどの令嬢が、ひつそりと寄添って立つて居た。
「二十八歳でいらっしゃいますの」
「ハア」夫人は、良太の略歴書に眼を通して、やさしく訊いた。
「Ｍ大学ですのね、優秀ですわ、柔道は学校時代おやりになつたのね、御両親は御健在？　Ｋ・Ｎ会社にお勤めねほんとに結構なこと」
　夫人は、略歴書に一通り眼を通すと良太の趣味を尋ねるのだった。
「至つて無趣味な方なんですが、コントは好きで書いています」
「ではＳ新聞の夕刊に出ているような？」
「ハア」
ムは何と仰言いますの？」
「水木京太です」
「まあ！」と驚いたような表情を見て、良太は、まずい事を云つたな、と後悔した。夫人は、側の令嬢と目（ま）を交して、お返事は本日中にお葉書で、と面接を打ち切った。夫人への譬えようもない素晴らしい魅力に圧倒された、良太は外へ出たもの、僅か三四分間遣つた丈で、おのぞみなれば……なんて失礼な都々逸を思い出したことが羞かしかった。
　良太はその時になつて、始めて応接室へ二冊の本を忘れたことに気が付いた。内容が内容丈に夫人や令嬢達が発見したら、どんな顔をするだろう。下手すれば応募資格がフイになるのではあるまいかと周章てたが、えゝまゝよ。一体どんな結果になるか見てやれと、糞度胸を据えて帰つて来た。
　ところが、それから二三日目の朝、水茎の跡も美しい一枚の葉書が、彼の下宿へ舞い込んだ良太は、会社の採用通知があった時より嬉しかった。こうして彼は幸運にも、二三十名の中から選ばれて、洋の美しい二室を無料で提供され、家族的優遇と、広告にあった通り、日曜日は、十時と三時のお菓子迄配慮してくれる行届き方であつた。令嬢は、真弓さんと呼んだ。良太は、それより女主人の素状を女中に尋ねたい衝動にかられるが、失礼だと思つてやめた。だが翌る日曜の午後、三時のお茶を持って来てくれた女中にこう尋ねた。
「どうしてあんなに沢山の中から、僕がお世話になることになったのでしょう。あなた判りませんか」
と訊いてみたのである。女中は笑う

## 2️⃣ Normalized Japanese

「……の男子、柔道又は拳闘の心得ある方に限る。日当たり良き二階二室、無料提供。略歴持参。当方、母・娘・女中の少人数。家族的優遇。面談のこと」

　良太はその広告の途中から、ニヤリとほくそ笑んでいた。ちょうど手頃な下宿を探していた矢先でもあったが、何より条件が気に入った。柔道初段は少々心細いが、ボクシングならライト級で自信は大いにあり、ストレートパンチが得意なのだ。
　翌日、良太はその夕刊を握りしめて一番電車で広告の住所へ尋ねて行った頃には、早くも二十三人の「我こそは柔道×段、ボクシング×級」の猛者ばかりが列を作って待っていた。九時の面談時間までには、およそ二、三十人の列になった。
　何しろ住宅難の今日のこと、この応募者の数には不思議はなかった。これらの男たちも良太と同じく、ただ二階の無料提供だけに魅力を感じているのではないかもしれない。多分、彼らも「母・娘」に魅力を感じているのだろうと、良太は考えるのである。
「貸間札、二階貸します、お望みなれば、下（シタ）も貸します後家世帯……」
　良太はふと、春の週末旅行の温泉宿で課長が歌った都々逸（どどいつ）を思い出して、「俺は何という卑しい奴だろう」と、一人で赤面した。
　良太がピース（タバコ）の七本目に火を付けた頃、ようやく門が開いて、順番に先のものから応接室へ案内されていった。
　彼はだんだん自信がなくなってきたが、でもどんな間違いで幸運が回ってこないとも限らない。良太は、貸してもらえる二階の部屋を想像するより、その母娘なるものに早く会ってみたいと思った。
　いよいよ彼の番が迫ってくると、時間の合間に読んでいた例の「性典」と一冊の本を、急いで英字新聞でカモフラージュした。そして応接室へ通された。
「どうぞ、お掛けになってくださいな」
　優しくチャーミングな、世慣れた声と共に、良太の前に美しい四十歳前後の婦人が立っている。期待を裏切らない美人だった。
「はあ」向かい合って座った。美しい夫人の後ろに、隠れるように十八歳ほどの令嬢が、ひっそりと寄り添って立っていた。
「二十八歳でいらっしゃいますのね」
「はあ」夫人は良太の履歴書に目を通して、優しく聞いた。
「Ｍ大学ですのね、優秀ですわ。柔道は学生時代になさったのね。ご両親はご健在？ Ｋ・Ｎ会社にお勤めね、本当に結構なこと」
　夫人は履歴書に一通り目を通すと、良太の趣味を尋ねるのだった。
「至って無趣味な方なんですが、コントは好きで書いています」
「では、Ｓ新聞の夕刊に出ているような？」
「はあ。ペンネームは何とおっしゃいますの？」
「水木京太です」
「まあ！」と驚いたような表情を見て、良太は「まずいことを言ったな」と後悔した。夫人は側の令嬢と目を合わせて、「お返事は本日中にハガキで」と面接を打ち切った。夫人への例えようもない素晴らしい魅力に圧倒された良太は外へ出たものの、わずか三、四分間いただけで、「お望みなれば……」なんて失礼な都々逸を思い出したことが恥ずかしかった。
　良太はその時になって、初めて応接室へ二冊の本を忘れたことに気がついた。内容が内容だけに、夫人や令嬢たちが発見したらどんな顔をするだろう。「下手すれば応募資格がフイになるのではないか」と慌てたが、「ええい、ままよ。一体どんな結果になるか見てやれ」と、居直って帰ってきた。
　ところが、それから二、三日目の朝、美しい筆跡の一枚のハガキが彼の下宿へ舞い込んだ。良太は会社の採用通知があった時より嬉しかった。こうして彼は幸運にも二十、三十名の中から選ばれて、和洋の美しい二室を無料で提供され、家族的優遇と広告にあった通り、日曜日は十時と三時のお菓子まで配慮してくれる行き届いた生活が始まった。令嬢は真弓さんと呼んだ。良太は、女主人の素性を女中に尋ねたい衝動に駆られるが、失礼だと思ってやめた。だが翌週の日曜日の午後、三時のお茶を持ってきてくれた女中にこう尋ねた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(Men... limited to those with knowledge of Judo or Boxing. Sunny, two rooms on second floor, free provision. Bring resume. Us: mother, daughter, maid, small number. Family-like treatment. Interview required.)

Ryota from the middle of that advertisement, "grinningly" was smiling with satisfaction. Just searching for a suitable room at that moment he was, but more than anything the conditions he liked. Judo 1st dan is a bit nervous-making, but for Boxing, at lightweight, confidence he had much; straight punch is his specialty.

The next day, Ryota that evening paper clutching, by the first train to the advertisement's address visited time at, already 23 people "I am Judo X-dan, Boxing X-class" brave men only a line forming were waiting. By the 9 o'clock interview time, approximately 20-30 people's line it became.

After all, the housing shortage of today's matter, regarding this applicants' number, wonder there was none. These men too, same as Ryota, just second floor free provision only attraction feeling were not probably. Probably they too, "mother-daughter?" to attraction feeling must be, Ryota thinks.

"Room for rent sign, second floor I will rent, if you wish, the bottom (first floor) too I will rent, widow's household..."
Ryota suddenly, at a spring weekend trip's hot spring inn, the ditty (dodoitsu) his manager sang remembered, "I, what a vulgar guy I am," alone he turned red.

By the time Ryota his 7th "Peace" cigarette lit, finally the gate opened, in order from the earlier ones to the drawing room were guided.
He gradually confidence was losing, but even so, by some mistake the turn (the chance) might come. Ryota, rather than imagining the second floor room to be rented, those "mother-daughter?" ones quickly meet and see he wanted.

Finally his turn approached, during the spare moments he was reading, that "Sex Manual" and one book, quickly with an English newspaper disguised. To the drawing room he was led.
"Please, take a seat."
With a gentle, charming, sophisticated voice, before Ryota a beautiful 40-year-old-around lady is standing. A beauty that did not disappoint expectations she was.
"Hah (Yes)." Facing each other they sat. Behind the beautiful lady, as if hiding, an 18-year-old-around young lady, quietly snuggling stood.

"28 years old you are, I see."
"Hah." The lady, through Ryota's resume looking, gently asked.
"M University, isn't it? Excellent. Judo in school days you did, right? Parents healthy? Working at K.N Company, really wonderful."
The lady, the resume once through looking, Ryota's hobbies asked.
"Extremely hobby-less person I am, but 'contes' (short sketches) I like writing."
"Then, like the ones in the S-paper's evening edition?"
"Hah." "Your pen name, what do you say?"
"It is Mizuki Kyota."
"Oh!" such a surprised expression seeing, Ryota, "bad thing I said," regretted. The lady, with the daughter at her side eyes exchanged, "The reply within today by postcard," the interview cut off. By the lady's incomparable wonderful charm overwhelmed, Ryota went outside, though only 3-4 minutes stayed, "If you wish..." such a rude ditty remembering was shameful.

Ryota at that time, for the first time in the drawing room two books forgotten he noticed. The content being the content, if the lady and daughter discover them, what kind of face will they make? If things go bad, applicant eligibility "phut" (lost) might become he panicked, but "Oh well. Whatever result happens, let's see," with guts (kuso-dokyo) he returned home.

However, from then 2-3 days later morning, beautiful brush traces' one postcard to his lodging flew in. Ryota, than when the company's employment notice was, happier he was. Thus he luckily, from among 20-30 people chosen, beautiful Western-Japanese two rooms for free provided, family-like treatment and as in the ad, Sundays 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock sweets even considered attentive way it was. The daughter, Mayumi-san he called. Ryota, more than that, the mistress's background to the maid ask impulse he felt, but rude he thought and stopped. But the following Sunday afternoon, 3 o'clock tea bringing maid to, thus he asked:
"Why from that many people, I came to be taken care of? Do you not know?"
thus he tried asking. The maid laughs...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The advertisement read: *"Young men only. Must have experience in Judo or Boxing. Two sunny rooms on the second floor provided free of charge. Bring resume. Small household consisting of mother, daughter, and maid. Family-like treatment. Interview required."*

Ryota couldn't help but grin with satisfaction as he read the ad. He had been looking for a suitable place to live, but these conditions were better than he could have hoped for. While his first-degree black belt in Judo was nothing to brag about, he was a confident lightweight boxer with a mean straight punch.

The next day, clutching the evening paper, Ryota took the first train to the address. By the time he arrived, twenty-three "tough guys"—all boasting various ranks in Judo and Boxing—were already lined up. By the start of the interviews at nine o'clock, the queue had grown to nearly thirty men. Given the severe housing shortage of the day, the turnout was hardly surprising. Ryota suspected, however, that like him, these men weren't just drawn by the free rent; they were likely intrigued by the mention of the "mother and daughter."

An old, bawdy ditty his manager had sung during a company retreat at a hot spring popped into his head: *"A room for rent on the second floor, and if you're lucky, the widow downstairs is included too..."* Ryota blushed, embarrassed by his own vulgar thoughts.

By the time he lit his seventh "Peace" cigarette, the gates finally opened. One by one, the applicants were ushered into the drawing room. His confidence began to wane, but he held onto the slim hope that luck might strike. He was less interested in the room itself now than in finally seeing the mysterious mother and daughter.

When his turn finally came, he hurriedly wrapped the two books he had been reading to kill time—one of which was a rather scandalous "Sex Manual"—in an English newspaper to hide the titles. 

"Please, do have a seat," a gentle, charming, and sophisticated voice greeted him. Standing before him was a beautiful woman in her late thirties. She was every bit the beauty he had hoped for. 

"Yes, ma'am," Ryota stammered as he sat down. Peeking out from behind the lady was her daughter, a girl of about eighteen, standing shyly by her side.

"So, you are twenty-eight," the lady said softly, looking over his resume. "M University? How impressive. And you did Judo in school? Are your parents well? I see you work at the K.N. Company. That’s very fine indeed." 

After reviewing his credentials, she asked about his hobbies. 
"I don't have many hobbies, but I do enjoy writing satirical sketches," he replied.
"Like the ones in the evening edition of the S-Newspaper?"
"Yes."
"And what is your pen name?"
"Mizuki Kyota."

The lady’s eyes widened in surprise. Ryota immediately regretted mentioning it, thinking he’d said something wrong. She exchanged a quick look with her daughter and abruptly ended the interview, saying, "We will notify you of our decision by postcard later today." Overwhelmed by her charms, Ryota hurried out, feeling ashamed that he had ever associated such an elegant woman with that crude ditty.

It wasn't until he was gone that he realized he’d left his two books behind in the drawing room. He panicked, imagining the look on their faces when they discovered the scandalous manual. He figured his chances were ruined, but then he braced himself. "Whatever happens, happens," he thought.

To his shock, a postcard written in beautiful calligraphy arrived at his lodgings two days later. He was happier than the day he’d landed his job. Out of thirty men, he had been chosen. He moved into two beautiful rooms, a mix of Western and Japanese styles, offered for free. True to the ad, he received "family treatment," including tea and sweets at ten and three every Sunday. He learned the daughter’s name was Mayumi. 

Ryota was dying to ask about the family's history, but he held his tongue out of politeness. Finally, one Sunday afternoon, he couldn't resist asking the maid as she brought his tea. 

"Why, out of all those men, did they choose me? Do you happen to know?"

The maid simply laughed...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tategaki*), reading from top-to-bottom and right-to-left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard mid-century Mincho (serif) typeface. Note the use of "iteration marks" (like 々) and small kana for okurigana.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The advertisement text at the very beginning is set apart, acting as the inciting incident for the plot.
*   **Illustrations:** There are three distinct illustrations:
    1.  **Top Left:** A profile of the protagonist, Ryota, looking handsome and contemplative (classic "shonen/seinen" style of the era).
    2.  **Middle Right:** The interview scene, showing Ryota sitting opposite the elegant mother and the demure daughter.
    3.  **Bottom:** A close-up of the daughter, Mayumi, looking toward the reader/Ryota with a charming, slight smile.
*   **Pacing:** The story is a "short-short" or a self-contained magazine piece, designed for quick consumption.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Housing Shortage (*Jutaku-nan*):** The text explicitly mentions the "housing shortage of today" (*jutaku-nan no kyo no koto*). Following WWII, Japanese cities suffered from extreme housing shortages due to firebombing. A free room in a nice house was an incredible luxury.
*   **Martial Arts Requirement:** After WWII, the GHQ (Occupying forces) initially banned martial arts like Judo, but the ban was lifted in the early 50s. The request for a man skilled in Judo or Boxing suggests the household was looking for a "protector" in a period of social instability.
*   **The "Peace" Cigarette:** Ryota smokes "Peace" brand cigarettes. Launched in 1946, Peace was a premium brand in the post-war era, signaling that Ryota is a relatively successful "salaryman" (as confirmed by his M University degree and K.N. Company job).
*   **Dodoitsu:** A traditional Japanese folk song/ditty style with a 7-7-7-5 syllable structure. They were often bawdy or romantic, frequently sung at drinking parties by older men (like the "Section Chief" mentioned).

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **北爽に笑む (Hokusou ni emu):** To smile with satisfaction or to smirk. Usually written as ほくそ笑む.
*   **都々逸 (Dodoitsu):** A form of popular Japanese song/poetry.
*   **性典 (Seiten):** Literally "Sex Manual" or "Book of Ethics/Sex." In the context of the 1950s, this refers to the "Sei-fuzoku" (sexual customs) literature that became popular after the war. It adds a layer of "youthful curiosity" and potential embarrassment for the protagonist.
*   **フイになる (Fui ni naru):** To come to nothing; to be spoiled/ruined.
*   **水茎の跡 (Mizuguki no ato):** A poetic way to refer to beautiful calligraphy or handwriting.
*   **糞度胸 (Kuso-dokyo):** Reckless bravery; "shitting-your-pants" guts. A very colloquial term.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Masculinity and Protection:** The ad specifically asks for a fighter. This reflects a subtext of post-war anxiety where a household of women (widow and daughter) felt vulnerable and sought a "rent-free" protector.
*   **The "Dream" of the Salaryman:** Ryota represents the ideal post-war youth: college-educated, employed at a firm, and possessing "modern" hobbies like writing for newspapers.
*   **Class and Manners:** Despite the martial arts requirement, the mother chooses Ryota because he is "excellent" (M University) and a writer. The subtext suggests she was looking for a "gentleman-protector" rather than just a thug.
*   **Light Eroticism:** The mention of the "Sex Manual" and the bawdy ditty adds a "cheeky" flavor common in mid-century men's magazines, playing on the fantasy of moving into a house full of beautiful women.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Romance, Comedy of Manners, Housing Shortage, Masculinity, Salaryman Life.
