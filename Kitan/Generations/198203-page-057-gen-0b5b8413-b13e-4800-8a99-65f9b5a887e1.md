## Literal English Translation

Having developed Yasue’s anus, I thought of trying anal sex, and immediately began preparations for that. Since having her take in my own thing suddenly seemed impossible, I applied Vaseline and proceeded with the expansion of her anus.

Yasue pleaded, “It surely must hurt, so please use just a finger,” but I ignored her, and next after my finger, I made her take in a slightly slender "rubber doll" I acquired at an adult toy shop.
Due to my forcing, Yasue gave up and began to cooperate, and she got used to the rubber doll while groaning "un-un."
When the stage finally came to insert the Real Thing, Yasue began to complain repeatedly and sorrowfully, but feeling that I could not stop now, I finally fulfilled my goal.
Having had her anus conquered, Yasue seemed to have increased her Maso-inclination and begun to think that she must absolutely obey my commands.

One time, I had her wear only a single coat over her bare skin, took her to a deserted residential street late at night, and made her take off the coat and have a dog urinate on her. I was intensely excited by Yasue, who was urinating while lifting one leg, and I made her hold my engorged thing in her mouth, ending it just like that.

The reason Yasue became so deeply immersed in Maso-dom was perhaps partly because her body was one that could not bear children, leading her to be shunned by her husband.
In contrast to the S&M play with Yasue constantly escalating, the relationship with Kiyomi, conversely, did not advance beyond bondage play. Perhaps it was because the age gap between us was too great, and I hesitated to engage in radical play.
Six months have passed since that Kiyomi suddenly disappeared. Just as I initially thought, perhaps SM was not suited for her.

## Literary English Translation

I decided to open up Yasue’s anus and try anal sex, immediately setting about the preparations. Since having her take my own member suddenly seemed too difficult, I applied Vaseline and concentrated on expanding her anus.

Yasue pleaded, convinced it would hurt, "Please, just use your finger," but I disregarded her. After my finger, I made her receive a slender "rubber doll" I had bought at an adult toy store.
Faced with my persistence, Yasue gave up and began to cooperate, growing accustomed to the rubber doll while moaning softly.
When the time finally came to insert the Real Thing, Yasue began to cry out in protest, but I felt I could not stop now, and so I finally achieved my objective.
Having had her anus subdued, Yasue seemed to have deepened her inherent masochism and realized that she must submit absolutely to my commands.

On one occasion, I dressed her in nothing but a coat over her naked body, led her to a deserted residential street late at night, and forced her to remove the coat and submit to a dog’s urination. I was profoundly aroused by Yasue, who was urinating while lifting one leg, and I made her take my engorged penis into her mouth, concluding the session right there.

Yasue’s deep obsession with masochism was possibly rooted in the fact that her body was unable to bear children, resulting in her being alienated by her husband.
In contrast to the ever-escalating S&M play with Yasue, my relationship with Kiyomi, conversely, never progressed beyond simple bondage. Perhaps the age difference between us was too large, causing me to hesitate regarding more radical play.
Six months have passed since Kiyomi abruptly vanished. As I suspected from the start, perhaps SM was simply not for her.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Metric | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Pseudo-Reportage / Confessional Fiction. It reads as a detached, clinical, yet sensationalized first-person account of BDSM dominance, framed as a "case study" of two different partners. |
| **Author Attribution** | Implicitly the male dom/narrator (私は). No explicit name or pseudonym is provided, typical for anonymous, boundary-pushing content. |
| **Editorial Voice** | The voice is the narrator's, highly clinical and controlling ("I fulfilled my goal," "I made her take in," "I ignored her"). The final paragraph introduces Kiyomi as a comparative case, lending a faux-analytical structure. |
| **Narrator Voice** | Domineering, methodical, objectifying. Focuses on the subjugation process, the physiological/psychological transformation (Yasue's Maso-inclination), and the achievement of highly transgressive acts. |
| **Target Audience Signals**| Explicit BDSM terminology (SMプレイ, マゾ, 緊縛), interest in humiliation (dog urination), sexual taboos (anal sex, fellatio after public debasement). Targeted at readers seeking extreme ero-guro content. |
| **Positioning** | Likely placed in the latter half of the magazine where the most explicit, usually image-accompanied, fiction/reportage appeared. |
| **Source Context** | This text highly complements the accompanying image (a woman in heavy shibari/bondage, naked, hanging/bent over), suggesting a strong visual-textual pairing common in *Kitan Club* during the 1950s/60s. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Ero-Guro Context:** This passage exemplifies the extreme exploration of sexual pathology and transgression central to the *ero-guro* movement in mid-20th-century Japan. The narrator's methodical cruelty and the subsequent psychological rationalization (Yasue's 'Maso-nature') are standard tropes.
*   **BDSM Terminology:** The use of acronyms (SM) and specific concepts (マゾっけ, 緊縛プレイ) confirms its placement within the emerging dedicated BDSM discourse of post-war Japanese pulp culture (c. 1950s onward).
*   **Anal Sex (アナル・セックス):** While often euphemized, the text is explicit about the methodical process of expansion (ワセリン, ゴム人形) before the insertion of the "Real Thing" (ホンモノ), indicating a focus on specific sexual acts rather than generalized kink.
*   **Social Shame as Origin:** The justification for Yasue’s masochism—her inability to bear children (子供を産めない体) and subsequent shunning by her husband—is a recurring narrative device. It links sexual deviance to societal failure, offering a perverse form of sexual redemption or fulfillment through abjection. This provided a socially palatable (though fictionalized) psychological backstory for the extreme acts.
*   **Humiliation and Urolagnia:** The final debasing act (stripped naked, dog urination, public street) marks a severe escalation into extreme fetishism (urolagnia, public exposure/shame). The climax of the act, forcing her to orally receive his engorged penis (*怒張したものを口に含ませた*) immediately after this intense humiliation, ties her full degradation to the narrator's sexual release.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Japanese) | Translation / Euphemism | Historical Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| アヌス (Anusu) | Anus | Direct loanword, used in clinical or sensational contexts. |
| ゴム人形 (Gomu Ningyō) | Rubber Doll | Referring here not to a full-sized doll, but to a rubber object/dildo used for penetration practice/expansion. |
| ホンモノ (Honmono) | The Real Thing | Euphemism for the male penis, contrasted with the preparatory objects. |
| マゾっけ (Mazo-kke) | Maso-inclination/Nature | The quality or drive toward masochism. Implies a discovery of an innate trait. |
| すっ裸 (Suppadaka) | Stark naked | Colloquial and emphatic term for complete nudity. |
| 犬の放尿 (Inu no Hōnyō) | Dog's urination | Explicit reference to urolagnia (urine fetish) combined with forced humiliation. |
| 怒張したもの (Dochō shita mono) | Engorged/Swollen Thing | Euphemism for the aroused penis. |
| 緊縛プレイ (Kinbaku Play) | Bondage Play | Specific term for Japanese rope bondage (Shibari). |
| 哀訴 (Aiso) | Plaintive appeal/Pleading | Suggests a desperate, almost tearful resistance, which the dominant ignores. |

## Themes & Subtext

| Theme | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Absolute Domination** | The central theme is the systematic breaking of the subject (Yasue). The narrator's actions are methodical: preparation (Vaseline, toys), escalation (finger, doll, 'real thing'), followed by psychological reconditioning (submission, maso-nature). |
| **Objectification & Performance** | Yasue is treated purely as an object for the narrator’s gratification. Her humiliation (the coat, the dog, the public street) transforms the sexual act into a ritualistic performance of debasement. |
| **The Utility of Shame** | Extreme shame (infertility, public nudity, forced urination) is explicitly framed as the fuel for Yasue's psychological shift into submission, serving the dominant's narrative. |
| **The Consumerist Kink** | The purchase of the 'rubber doll' at the 'adult toy shop' places the fetishistic acts within the realm of modern, commercialized pleasure seeking, contrasting with traditional taboos. |
| **The Vanishing Subject** | The contrasting case of Kiyomi, who "disappeared" because SM was not "suited" for her, highlights the narrator's transactional view of his partners. Those who resist the escalation (Kiyomi) are rejected or disappear; only those who fully internalize the trauma (Yasue) remain. |

## Content Classification Tags

*   Sexual content: High intensity (Explicit acts, Anal Sex, Forced Fellatio, Urolagnia/Humiliation)
*   Violence: Low (Psychological coercion is high, physical pain implied but not detailed)
*   Coercion: High (Explicit forcing of sexual acts, disregard for pain/protest)
*   Medical / bodily themes: Low (References to anatomy and infertility)
*   Taboo or illegal implications: High (Public debasement, animal-related act/urolagnia, explicit non-consensual acts)
