ゆう大年増なんですからね、
　皆さんの御想像のように、彼、名が半年ばかり後には佐々木に変り、魚屋から八百万の主人になつたんですよ、つまり此れでよし江の夫は三代目になつたわけですね。
　八百星に商買かえをした彼は顧みないまゝに、それでも眞面目に働きました。大体、店の評判は、これまでさして悪くもなかつた所へ、威勢のいい魚屋が主人になつたんですから、店の中もずん、と活気いていました。
「若い頃は、最初の夫と荷車をひいた事もあるよし江も、今ぢや帳場に坐つて二、三人の若衆を使おうとゆう結構な身分になつたんですよ、
　ところが、或る日、彼がフラリと私の所へ果物を持つて遊びに来ましたね、いや其の時は驚きましたよ、あんなに頑丈だつた彼がひどくやつれて元氣がないんですよ。
『どうしたんだ。何か病氣なのかい。ばかりに顔色がよくないが。』
『どうも、俺も長い事はないような気がする、めつきり近頃、気が弱つてしまつたんだ。』
『一体、どうしたんだ。』
『よし江は、君、ひのえうまの女なんだ、丙午の女は亭主を喰い殺すとゆう迷信があるが、必ずしも嘘ではないらしい。』
『馬鹿な……。』
『いや、考えて見ろよ、最初の男が原因不明で結婚後七年目にボックリ死んでしまうし、二番目が、仕入れに行つた歸りに心臓麻痺であつけなくお陀佛、三番目の俺が、半年もならないのに、この身体だ。
　いや、これには俺も思い當る所もあるんだがね。』
　彼は奇妙な笑いを頬に一寸刻むと言葉を切つたんですが、つまり彼の言う所はこうなんです。
　女盛りのよし江と結婚した彼は、先づ最初に、彼女の性慾が猛烈なのに驚いた。
　元來が水商賣上りの彼女は、閨房の扱いも極めて巧みであるのは當然で、死んだ佐々木が、三寸、四分なしと言つた言葉も、どうやら、おぼろ気ながら判つて来たような気がするのであつた。
　生れつき色が白く肌のきめの細かな彼女の肉体は、あたかも章魚のようなヌメヌメとした粘つこい、それでいて吸いつくような皮膚の滑らかさには、それに觸れば、何にかに溶け入つてしまう蕩然境に彷徨するのとであつた。
　羞恥心と言つたものを一應御破算にした年輩の彼女の、思いきつた大膽で奔放な姿態と行動は、相手の男をグイ／＼と手管の奈落の中へ引きずり込んでゆく魅力に溢れていた。
　太りじしのそれでいて若々しい弾力を持つた精力的な彼女の肉体は、泉のように汲んでも汲んでも盡きない夜毎に挑んで来るのであつた。
　彼女の要求の中に感溺し、そしてそうすればするだけ更に強い反應を示して狂乱に迄高められてくる彼女の性に對して、如何な男も無理とは知りつゝ、その無理も麻痺した感覚の中に感じなくなつてゆくのであつた。
　恰かも、酒飲みが飲んでも飲んでも、満足なくて後には、酒の味は分らなつて水をのむように、無意識に口へ運んでゆくと言つた状態と同じ心理であつた。
「こうして話していても、よし江の白い肉体の蠢めきが、瞼にちらつきますよ。」
　彼はそんな風に言つた。あれは極端な淫乱症なんですよ、殊に女盛りの二人の男も、この猛烈な彼女の要求に反應しているうちに、消耗しつくして腎虚になつたんだと確信するんです。
　二番目の男が軍隊へ入つて肥つて来たと言ゆうのも、彼女から離れたからだと思うんです。最初の男が消化器病と言うのは、身体の衰弱が余りに甚しかつたからだと思います。
　彼もそうなんですよ、結局彼女に喰い殺された事になりますね、彼に私は此の事をそれとなく注意したんですが、彼女に喰い殺されるにした所で、あれだけ現世の悦楽を味わわせて呉れたんだから、と言うんです。
　丁度、雄のカマキリが交尾した後に唯に喰い殺される事を承知の上で挑みなかつて行くのと、よく似た深刻な本能の一つですね。
　齋藤氏の話はここで又一息ついた「で、その人はどうなつたんです」
　思わず私は齋藤氏に尋ねた。
「死にましたよ、一週間程前に、心臓麻痺で……。」
「あゝ、やつぱり。」
　人々はお互いに顔を見合わせた。
「忘れてはいけないのは、彼に二十萬の生命保険がついていた事です。
この様に物騒な世間ではと言うのです。」
「そのお金は彼女が受取りましたか」
「えゝ、昨日確かに受取つた筈です私の會社へ通知が来たのを私が見て判を押したんですからー。」
　一番最初が千五百圓、次に火災保険が五万圓、次の生命保険が十万、今が二十万圓、通用價値を現在に換算して八十万圓以上になりますね、今では彼女は店へ出なくても、店員が数人いますから楽ですよ……。
　意志のない殺人、彼女の官能殺人少くとも自殺ではありませんからね、若し彼女が此の點に氣がつかつていれば明らかに法的殺人罪を構成しますがね……そんな事は幽靈見器だつて判りやしません、彼女自身以外には、
　彼女は今年、もう四十近いですがまだまだ若くて美しい、又誰かと結婚するだろうと言う専ら近所の評判ですが、そして今度は四十萬圓の保険金をつけるだろうと言うのですがね、どうですか、皆さんの中に、逆に彼女を喰う自信のある方は、ありませんか……。」
　齋藤氏は一番最後に、こんな諧謔を弄して微笑した。私達も誘い込まれて思わず苦笑した。
　地下のクラブは、いゝきれと紫煙でむん／＼する程に湯氣がこもつて薄桃色の電燈も思いなしか屈託氣に低く垂れ込めていた。
　私は静かに椅子から立ち上つて出口に近づいた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Because she is a great mature woman, you see. As you all imagine, he, his name after about half a year changed to Sasaki, and from a fishmonger he became the master of 'Yaoyorozu,' that is to say, by this Yoshie's husband became the third generation.
He who did a change of business to 'Yaoboshi' (Eight Hundred Stars), without looking back, even so worked seriously. Generally, the shop's reputation until now was not so bad, and since a high-spirited fishmonger became the master, the inside of the shop was 'zun' (vibrantly) lively.
'In her youth, Yoshie, who once pulled a handcart with her first husband, now sits at the management desk and uses two or three young hands—she has reached a fine social position.
However, one day, he aimlessly came to my place to play, carrying fruit. No, at that time I was surprised. He who was so sturdy was terribly haggard and had no energy.
"What happened? Are you sick? Your complexion is just not good."
"Somehow, I feel I don't have long. Lately, my spirit has remarkably weakened."
"What on earth happened?"
"Yoshie is, you know, a Hinoe-uma (Fire Horse) woman. There is a superstition that a Fire Horse woman eats her husband to death, but it seems it is not necessarily a lie."
"Don't be foolish..."
"No, think about it. The first man died suddenly (bokkuri) seven years after marriage for unknown reasons; the second, on the way back from buying stock, died of heart failure—poof (odabutsu); and I, the third, haven't even reached half a year and have this body. No, I have some ideas about why this is."
He carved a strange smile on his cheek for a moment and cut his words, but in short, what he said was this.
Married to Yoshie in the prime of womanhood, he was first of all surprised by the ferocity of her sexual desire.
She, originally coming from the 'water trade' (nightlife), was naturally extremely skillful in bedchamber handling, and the words the late Sasaki said—'not even three inches four minutes'—he felt he had vaguely come to understand.
Her body, naturally white-skinned and fine-textured, was like an octopus—slimy and sticky, yet with a smoothness that sticks to you; if one touched it, it was as if wandering in a state of ecstatic melting.
This older woman, who had discarded things like shame, with her daring and uninhibited posture and actions, was full of charm that dragged the partner 'gui-gui' (forcefully) into the abyss of her tricks.
Her fleshy yet youthful, elastic, energetic body was like a spring—no matter how much you draw, it never runs dry. Every night she would challenge him.
Indulging in her demands, and the more he did so, her nature showed an even stronger reaction, rising to madness; toward her sexuality, any man, while knowing it was impossible, would lose the sense of that impossibility within his numbed senses.
It was the same psychology as a heavy drinker who drinks and drinks but is not satisfied, eventually losing the taste of sake and drinking it like water, unconsciously carrying it to the mouth.
"Even speaking like this, the wriggling of Yoshie's white flesh flits behind my eyelids."
He said it like that. 'That is extreme nymphomania. Especially toward her in the prime of womanhood, those two men, while reacting to her fierce demands, were exhausted to the point of kidney deficiency (sexual exhaustion), I am convinced.'
The fact that the second man got fat after entering the army, I think, is because he was away from her. The first man's digestive disease, I think, was because the physical weakness was too severe.
He was the same. In the end, he was 'eaten to death' by her. I warned him about this indirectly, but he said even if he is eaten to death, since she let him taste that much worldly pleasure, it was fine.
Just like a male praying mantis who, knowing he will be eaten to death by the female after mating, goes to challenge her—it is one of those profound instincts.'
Mr. Saito's talk paused here again. 'So, what happened to that person?'
Unintentionally, I asked Mr. Saito.
'He died. About a week ago, of heart failure...'
'Ah, as expected.'
People looked at each other's faces.
'What must not be forgotten is that a 200,000 yen life insurance was on him. In such a dangerous world, they say.'
'Did she receive that money?'
'Yes, she must have received it yesterday. I saw the notice that came to my company and I pressed the seal on it—'
The first was 1,500 yen, then fire insurance 50,000 yen, next life insurance 100,000, now 200,000 yen. Converting the exchange value to the present, it becomes over 800,000 yen. Now, even if she doesn't appear at the shop, she has several clerks, so it's easy for her...
Murder without intent, her 'sensual murder.' At least it wasn't suicide. If she were aware of this point, it would clearly constitute legal murder... but such a thing even a 'ghost detector' (metaphor for a detective/psychic) wouldn't understand, other than herself.
She is nearly forty this year, but still young and beautiful. The neighborhood rumor is that she will marry someone again, and next time they say she'll put 400,000 yen of insurance on him. How about it? Among you all, is there anyone confident enough to 'eat' her instead...?'
Mr. Saito, at the very end, joked like this and smiled. We too were drawn in and gave a wry smile.
The underground club was steaming with heat and purple smoke, and the pale pink light bulbs hung low, looking somehow troubled.
I quietly stood up from my chair and approached the exit."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"She's quite the mature vamp, you see. Just as you might imagine, barely six months later he had changed his name to Sasaki and gone from a simple fishmonger to the master of the 'Yaoyorozu' general store. In short, that made him Yoshie’s third husband.

Having pivoted the business to the 'Yaoboshi' grocery, he didn't look back; he worked with genuine diligence. The shop's reputation had never been poor, but with a high-spirited former fishmonger at the helm, the place positively hummed with new life.

'In her younger days,' the story goes, 'Yoshie used to pull a handcart alongside her first husband. Now, she's come up in the world, ensconced in the counting-house and managing several young clerks. Quite the lady of means.

Yet, one day, he drifted over to my place to visit, bringing some fruit. I tell you, I was appalled. This man, once so robust, was now a hollowed-out husk of himself, utterly devoid of vitality.

"What’s wrong?" I asked. "Are you ill? Your color is ghastly."
"I don't think I'm long for this world," he replied. "Lately, my very spirit seems to have withered away."
"For heaven's sake, what happened?"
"It's Yoshie, old friend. She's a *Hinoe-uma*—a Fire Horse woman. They say those women devour their husbands, and I'm beginning to think the old superstition isn't a lie at all."
"Don't be ridiculous..."
"Think about it! The first man dropped dead seven years after they wed, cause unknown. The second went out to buy stock and keeled over from a heart attack—gone, just like that. And here I am, the third, not even six months in, and look at me. I have a fair inkling as to why, too."

He paused, a peculiar, faint smile etching itself onto his face. This was the gist of what he told me:

Having married Yoshie in the peak of her womanhood, he was first struck by the sheer ferocity of her appetites. A veteran of the 'night trade,' she was naturally a virtuoso of the bedchamber. He finally understood the cryptic warning the late Sasaki had left behind—something about a 'three-inch-four-minute' limit.

Her skin was unnaturally pale and fine-grained, possessing a slick, cephalopod-like viscosity—a smoothness that didn't just touch but adhered to you. To graze it was to feel oneself dissolving into a hazy, ecstatic delirium. Having long since dispensed with the burden of shame, this mature woman’s bold, uninhibited maneuvers possessed a magnetism that dragged a man down, down into the abyss of her wiles.

Her body was lush, yet retained a youthful, springy vigor—a wellspring of energy that never ran dry, no matter how much one drank from it. Night after night, she would challenge him. Drowning in her demands, he found that the more he gave, the more violently her nature responded, escalating into a kind of madness. No man could keep pace, yet within that numbed state of sensory overload, the very concept of 'too much' ceased to exist. It was the psychology of the drunkard who drinks until he can no longer taste the liquor, eventually swilling it down like water out of sheer, unconscious habit.

"Even as I sit here talking to you," he whispered, "I can see the writhing of her white flesh behind my eyelids."

That was how he put it. He was convinced it was a case of extreme erotomania. He believed his predecessors had been worked to the point of total physical and sexual depletion—what we call 'kidney exhaustion'—by her relentless demands. He noted that the second husband only put on weight when he was drafted into the army, away from her. The first husband’s 'digestive ailment' was, in his view, simply a euphemism for total systemic collapse.

He suffered the same fate. In the end, she literally 'ate' him. I had tried to warn him indirectly, but his response was chilling: he said that even if she did devour him, she had provided him with such heights of worldly ecstasy that it was a fair trade. It’s that profound, dark instinct—the male praying mantis who submits to being consumed by the female just for the chance to mate.

Mr. Saito paused to catch his breath.
"So, what happened to him?" I asked, unable to contain myself.
"He died. About a week ago. Heart failure."
"Ah... of course."
The group exchanged knowing glances.
"And don't forget," Saito added, "there was a 200,000 yen life insurance policy on him. In this dangerous world, that's no small thing."
"Did she collect?"
"Oh, certainly. The notice came through my office yesterday; I’m the one who saw it and stamped the approval."

The tally was grim: 1,500 yen for the first; 50,000 in fire insurance; 100,000 for the second husband; and now 200,000. Adjusted for today’s inflation, that’s over 800,000 yen. Yoshie doesn’t even have to work the shop anymore; she has staff for that. It’s a comfortable life.

A murder without intent—a 'sensual homicide.' It wasn't suicide, after all. If she were conscious of what she was doing, it would be a clear-cut case of murder, but no machine on earth could prove intent in a case like this. Only she knows.

She’s nearly forty now, but still a stunning woman. The neighbors are all whispering that she’ll be down the aisle again soon. They say the next policy will be for 400,000. So, how about it? Any of you gentlemen feel confident enough that you could be the one to 'eat' her instead?"

Saito ended his tale with a dark, mocking grin. We all forced a dry laugh. The basement club was thick with heat and the blue haze of cigarette smoke. The pale pink light bulbs hung low, looking as weary as we felt. I stood up quietly and made for the exit."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese magazine format from the mid-20th century. It uses vertical typesetting (*tategaki*), reading from right to left, top to bottom.
*   **Column Structure:** The page is divided into multiple vertical columns, a standard for long-form narrative prose in magazines.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho-style serif used in printing. Notably, it utilizes older typesetting conventions:
    *   **Full-size Sokuon/Yoon:** Small kana like *tsu* (っ) or *ya, yu, yo* (ゃ、ゅ、ょ) are printed at full size (つ、や、ゆ、よ). This is a hallmark of pre-war and early post-war printing before the 1946 orthography reforms were fully standardized in the commercial press.
    *   **Kanji:** While mostly modern, some older forms are present, and the density of kanji reflects a "literary" but accessible style for adult readers.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text is dense, intended for focused reading. There is a page number "- 28 -" centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger serialized story or a collection of "true tales."
*   **Atmospheric Elements:** The final paragraph shifts from the dialogue to a descriptive "hardboiled" setting—a smoky underground club—which serves as a narrative frame.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (1950s):** The mention of "800,000 yen" and insurance payouts in the tens/hundreds of thousands suggests the mid-1950s. This was the "Kasutori" era, named after a cheap, low-quality shochu. Magazines of this era focused on the "Three S's" (Screen, Sex, and Sports), often featuring sensationalist "true crime," erotic-grotesque (ero-guro) stories, and urban mysteries.
*   **Hinoe-uma (Fire Horse):** This refers to the 43rd year of the sexagenary cycle. According to Japanese superstition, women born in this year (e.g., 1846, 1906, 1966) have a volatile personality and are destined to "eat" (kill) their husbands. This superstition was taken very seriously; birth rates in Japan dropped significantly in 1966 because of it.
*   **Insurance Fraud Tropes:** Post-war Japan saw a rise in "life insurance murder" stories in popular media, reflecting social anxieties about the breakdown of traditional morals and the rise of a materialistic society.
*   **The "Water Trade" (Mizu-shobai):** Mentioning the woman came from the "water trade" (bars, clubs, brothels) was a shorthand for being sexually experienced, manipulative, and "dangerous" to "respectable" men.
*   **Male Praying Mantis:** A common literary metaphor in the "femme fatale" genre, where male sexual desire is depicted as a fatal biological trap.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **大年増 (O-toshima):** Literally "great mature woman." In this context, it refers to a woman in her late 30s or early 40s who is still sexually attractive but considered "past her prime" by traditional standards.
*   **八百万 (Yaoyorozu):** Literally "eight million," a poetic way to say "innumerable" or "all things." Here, it functions as the name of a general store.
*   **ボックリ (Bokkuri):** An onomatopoeic word for dying suddenly and without pain.
*   **お陀仏 (Odabutsu):** A slangy, slightly irreverent term for dying, derived from "Amida Butsu" (Amida Buddha).
*   **蕩然境 (Tozen-kyo):** A state of being completely entranced or melting away in ecstasy.
*   **淫乱症 (Inran-sho):** An archaic/clinical term for nymphomania or erotomania.
*   **腎虚 (Jinkyo):** In traditional East Asian medicine, this refers to "kidney deficiency," often associated with exhaustion due to excessive sexual activity.
*   **諧謔 (Kaigyaku):** Humor, jest, or banter.
*   **紫煙 (Shien):** Literally "purple smoke," a literary term for cigarette/cigar smoke.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Femme Fatale:** The central theme is the "dangerous woman" who uses her sexuality to drain men of their life force and money. Yoshie is depicted as a biological predator rather than a cold-blooded killer—she doesn't use poison, she uses "excessive vitality."
*   **Male Anxiety:** The story reflects post-war male anxieties regarding the "new woman" and the perceived loss of male dominance. The men are depicted as "sturdy" yet easily "withered" by female sexuality.
*   **Sensualist/Nihilistic Tone:** The underground club setting and the narrator’s wry acceptance of the "mantis" instinct suggest a cynical, noir-like worldview common in the "buraiha" (decadent) school of Japanese literature.
*   **Eroticism and Death (Eros & Thanatos):** The text explicitly links the heights of sexual pleasure with the inevitability of death, suggesting that the "ecstasy" is worth the fatal price.
