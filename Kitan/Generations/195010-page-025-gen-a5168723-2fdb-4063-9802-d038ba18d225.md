## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

「わたし達は女学生全部のためにしてるんだよ、一人でもお前さんのような汚れた女がいると 皆が迷惑するからね」
　美代は何か抗弁したいように口を動かしたが、あきの視線に合うと黙つてしまつた。暴力の前には理論のないことを予感したものであろう。
「とにかく、女学生全部に代つてあんたに制裁を加えるわ」
　何度も何度も言い慣れただけに底に重味のある言い方で、不気味な声音であつた。
「乱暴すると警察へ言うわよ」
　美代は逃れんと必死であつた。
「言えばいくさ、そうすればお前さんの行状だつて明るみに出るんだからね」
　これも言い馴らした文句であつた。美代は四五人に押えつけられてもがいたが、びくともしないのに大声で泣き出した。小夜は美代の口の中へ細絛を押し込むと上から手拭で猿轡をかませた。「裸にするのよ」ひさはそう言つて、セーラー服を脱がせ、シャツを剥いだ。小麦色の肌の色はなめらかで可愛い、乳房がその下から現れた。上半身を裸にすると、後半にしぼり上げた細絛は柔らかそうな肌にきつく喰い込んで美代は身をもだえたが、「ろゝ」と手の平で叩くだけで声にはならなかつた。それを前にして皆瞬時ためらつたが、一人が思い切つてスカートに手をかけると忽ち美代は全裸にされてしまつた。流石の美代の顔には屈辱と羞恥の色が激しくみなぎつた。あき達は頬を紅潮させ昂奮した言葉で「生意気なやつだ」
「黒百合園の私刑をうんと思知らせてやれ」
と声高に喚き合つた。
素裸の美代の身体は、腹部の下に飛箱の台を入れてしばりつけられた。身体は二つに曲り、マンドリンを二つ並べたような肉附きのいい臀部が露出された。
「臀をぶつんだ」
ひさはあきのバンドを借りると、ピシリと力任せに美代の臀を殴つた。白い臀部に赤い筋がみる／＼浮いて見えた。ひさは狂つたようにバンドを振りつづけた。美代は苦しい息の下から「ヒー、ヒー」と呻いた。ひさが疲れると瀧枝が代つてぶつた。肉に喰い込む革の音は皆を攪乱した。
「あたいにもぶたせて」
と次々バンドをふるつた。
古く朽ち果てた建物の中で、こんな気違いじみた行為が繰返されているのも知らぬげに、まだ日の短い早春の夕暮れは早く、あたりを薄暗く染めて行つた。
　美代の臀部はひどく腫れ上つていた。美代は跳箱にしがみつくようにしてぐつたりとなつていて、それでもぶたれる度にかすかに身体をよじらせて苦痛の表情を見せた。小夜が猿轡をとると、美代はぜい／＼とかすれた声で呻いた
　あきは始終それをぢつと見ていたが、何のためにこの女を撲らねばならないのか、と思つた。何を偉そうに、とふり落そうと頭をふつたが、この女は皆が神秘としていたことをやりとげた誇りをもつただけなのだ。何の意味もない行為を憧れただけなのだ。今ではきつと後悔しているに違いない。きつと、あきが何時も感ずるあの虚脱した、味気ない気持を味つたのに過ぎまい。あきが一生かけて憎み呪つて来た幸福は結局誰にも無いのではないかしら、結局皆同じなのだ。
　あきは頭を押えた。
　目の前でぐつたりしている美代の裸体は即ちあき自身の姿なのだ。それをいぢめて何があるのか。あきは今迄にやつて来たことが自分自身を虐むものでしかないと顧みた。そう思うと今にも気が狂いそうであつた。大声でわつと叫んで頭をそこの羽目板にぶつけてしまい度い衝動にふる＼／した。
　いつそ思い切つて洋服を脱いで美代のように飛箱の上に腹這いになり、この臀を鞭で思い切り殴つて貰えばいくらか気が晴れるかも知れないと思つた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"We, for the sake of all female students, are doing [this]. Even one person like you, a soiled woman, if [they] exist, everyone is troubled, you see."
Miyo, as if wanting to make some protest, moved [her] mouth, but when [her] gaze met Aki's, [she] became silent. Before violence, that there is no logic, [she] likely sensed.
"Anyway, on behalf of all female students, [I] will add a sanction to you."
Because it was said many, many times and [she was] used to saying [it], it was a way of speaking with weight at the bottom, in an eerie voice tone.
"If [you] act violently, [I] will tell the police!"
Miyo was desperate to escape.
"If [you] say it, go ahead. If [you] do that, your conduct will also come into the light, you see."
This also was a phrase [she was] accustomed to saying. Miyo, even though held down by four or five people, struggled, but while it did not budge, [she] began to cry in a loud voice. Sayo, into Miyo's mouth, pushed a thin cord and from above, with a hand-towel, made [her] bite a gag. "Make [her] naked," Hisa said so, and made [her] take off the sailor uniform and stripped the shirt. The wheat-colored skin color was smooth, and cute breasts from beneath that appeared. When making the upper body naked, the thin cord tied up behind the back bit harshly into the soft-looking skin, and Miyo writhed [her] body, but "uu" [sound], only hitting with the palm of the hand, it did not become a voice. Facing that, everyone for an instant hesitated, but one person decisively put a hand on the skirt, and suddenly Miyo was made completely naked. As expected, in Miyo's face, the colors of humiliation and shame intensely surged. Aki and the others made [their] cheeks flush and with excited words, "A cheeky brat," "The Black Lily Garden's private lynching, make [her] realize it plenty," [they] shouted to each other in high voices.

The completely naked Miyo's body, under the abdomen, had a vaulting horse box placed and was tied down. The body bent in two, and well-fleshed buttocks like two mandolins lined up were exposed.
"Strike the buttocks!"
Hisa, borrowing Aki's belt, with all [her] might, struck Miyo's buttocks with a crack. On the white buttocks, red stripes visibly rose up. Hisa, like [she was] crazy, continued to swing the belt. Miyo, from under [her] painful breath, groaned "hee, hee." When Hisa got tired, Takie took over and struck. The sound of leather biting into flesh disturbed everyone. "Let me strike too," and one after another [they] brandished the belt.

Inside the old, decayed building, while being unaware that such mad acts were being repeated, the early spring sunset, when days are still short, was early, and dyed the surroundings dimly.
Miyo's buttocks were severely swollen up. Miyo was as if clinging to the vaulting horse, becoming limp, and even so, every time [she] was struck, [she] slightly twisted [her] body and showed an expression of pain. When Sayo took off the gag, Miyo groaned in a wheezing, hoarse voice.

Aki was staring at it from start to finish, but for what purpose must this woman be beaten, [she] thought. "Acting so grand," [she] shook [her] head to shake [it] off, but this woman had only the pride of having accomplished what everyone regarded as a mystery. [She] only yearned for an act that had no meaning. Now, surely [she] must be regretting [it]. Surely, [she] did no more than taste that hollow, tasteless feeling that Aki always feels. The happiness Aki has spent a lifetime hating and cursing, after all, does anyone have it? After all, everyone is the same.
Aki pressed [her] head.
The naked body of Miyo, lying limp before [her] eyes, is namely Aki's own figure. By bullying that, what is there? Aki looked back that what [she] had done until now was nothing but tormenting herself. Thinking that, [she] felt as if [she] would go crazy even now. [She] trembled with the impulse to shout "waa" in a loud voice and smash [her] head against the wainscotting there.
Rather, decisively taking off [her] clothes, becoming prone on the vaulting horse like Miyo, and having these buttocks struck with a whip with all [their] might, [she] thought perhaps [her] mood might clear up somewhat.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"We are doing this for the sake of the entire student body," Aki declared. "If even one 'soiled' girl like you is among us, it brings shame upon us all."
Miyo’s lips parted as if to protest, but when her eyes met Aki’s, she fell silent. She seemed to instinctively understand that logic held no power in the face of raw violence.
"In any case, on behalf of all the girls, I am going to see that you are disciplined."
Aki’s voice was eerie and carried a heavy, practiced weight, as if she had delivered this speech many times before.
"If you lay a hand on me, I’ll tell the police!" Miyo cried out in a desperate bid for freedom.
"Go ahead and tell them. But if you do, your own scandalous behavior will come to light as well."
This, too, was a rehearsed threat. Though four or five girls pinned her down, Miyo struggled wildly until, realizing her efforts were futile, she burst into loud sobs. Sayo jammed a thin cord into Miyo’s mouth and secured a gag with a hand-towel. "Strip her," Hisa commanded. They pulled off her sailor blouse and tore away her chemise. Her smooth, sun-kissed skin was revealed, and her youthful breasts came into view. As they bared her upper body, the cords binding her arms behind her back bit deeply into her soft flesh. Miyo writhed in pain, but her cries were reduced to muffled, pathetic grunts. For a brief moment, the group hesitated. Then, one girl reached for Miyo’s skirt, and in an instant, she was stripped completely bare. Miyo’s face burned with a fierce mixture of humiliation and shame. Aki and the others, their cheeks flushed with excitement, began to jeer. "Such a cheeky little thing!" "Let's make sure she never forgets the 'justice' of the Black Lily Garden!" they shouted.

They forced the naked Miyo facedown over a gymnasium vaulting box and bound her securely. Her body was bent double, exposing her shapely, well-fleshed buttocks, which looked like a pair of mandolins resting side-by-side. 
"Strike her!"
Hisa borrowed Aki’s leather belt and brought it down with a sharp crack across Miyo’s buttocks. Red welts rose instantly on the pale skin. As if possessed, Hisa rained down blow after blow. Miyo’s breath came in ragged, wheezing gasps of "hee, hee." When Hisa grew tired, Takie took over. The sound of leather meeting flesh seemed to whip the others into a frenzy. "Let me have a turn!" they cried, taking the belt one after another.

Outside the decaying building, the early spring sun set quickly, casting the world into a dim twilight, indifferent to the madness unfolding within.
Miyo’s backside was now horribly swollen. She lay slumped against the vaulting box, nearly senseless, yet her body still jolted with every strike. When Sayo finally removed the gag, Miyo could only manage a hoarse, rattling groan.

Aki had watched the entire ordeal in silence, but a sudden thought struck her: *Why are we even doing this?* She tried to shake off the feeling of pity, telling herself that Miyo was just arrogant for thinking she could get away with her secrets. But she realized Miyo had only sought the same hollow thrill that Aki herself often chased. Miyo was likely already regretting it, tasting that same empty, bitter sensation that Aki knew all too well. *Is there any such thing as the 'happiness' I’ve spent my life hating and envying?* she wondered. *In the end, aren't we all just the same?*
Aki clutched her head.
The broken, naked body of Miyo lying before her was a mirror of her own soul. What was gained by tormenting her? Aki realized that everything she had done up to this point was merely a form of self-torture. The thought made her feel as though she were losing her mind. She felt a violent impulse to scream and bash her own head against the wall.
In that moment, she felt a strange, dark urge: to strip off her own clothes, lie across that vaulting box just as Miyo had, and let them whip her until the sheer pain finally cleared the fog from her heart.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic vertical orientation (*tategaki*). It occupies a single page with a centered page number (25) at the bottom.
*   **Typography:** The typeface is a standard Mincho style typical of mid-century Japanese printing. It features small *furigana* (reading aids) for difficult kanji like 猿轡 (gag), 臀部 (buttocks), and 攪乱 (disturbance/distraction). 
*   **Visual Elements:** An illustration in the bottom right corner shows a young woman (presumably Miyo or Aki) in a state of distress, lying face-down. The signature "玲子" (Reiko) suggests the illustrator's name. The illustration serves as a visual hook for the "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) nature of the story.
*   **Narrative Structure:** The story uses a third-person limited perspective, primarily following the character "Aki." It moves from external action (the punishment) to internal psychological monologue (Aki's realization).
*   **Hierarchy:** The title is missing from this specific page (suggesting it's a middle page or the end of a short story), but the "――終――" (End) marker clearly indicates the conclusion of the piece.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-War 1940s-50s):** This text likely comes from a *kasutori* magazine. These were cheap, sensationalist publications that flourished in the chaotic years after WWII. They often featured themes of decadence, "ero-guro," and rebellion against traditional morality.
*   **Educational Setting:** The mention of "女学生" (*jo-gakusei* - female students) and "セーラー服" (sailor uniforms) places the story in a school context. In the pre-and-post-war era, elite girls' schools were often portrayed in fiction as hotbeds of secret societies and intense, sometimes cruel, interpersonal relationships (the "S" culture).
*   **The "Black Lily Garden" (黒百合園):** This sounds like a fictional name for a school or a specific clique within a school. The use of "私刑" (*shikei* - private lynching/vigilante punishment) reflects a trope of secret student tribunals.
*   **Corporal Punishment:** While illegal in schools post-1947, depictions of students disciplining each other were common in pulp fiction to titillate readers.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **猿轡 (Sarugutwa):** Literally "monkey bit." It refers to a gag.
*   **臀部 / 臀 (Denbu / Shiri):** Formal/Medical vs. common terms for buttocks. The use of the formal term in a pulp context adds a "clinical" or "scientific" layer to the eroticized violence.
*   **行状 (Gyōjō):** Behavior or conduct, often used in a negative sense (misconduct).
*   **私刑 (Shikei):** Summary justice or lynching. It implies the girls are taking the law into their own hands.
*   **跳箱 (Tobibako):** A vaulting horse used in physical education. Using a piece of school equipment as a torture rack is a common trope in this genre.
*   **羽目板 (Hameita):** Wainscoting or wood paneling.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Internalized Misogyny and Purity:** The justification for the beating is that Miyo is a "soiled woman" (汚れた女). The girls act as self-appointed moral police, enforcing a standard of "purity" that they themselves seem to find burdensome.
*   **Eroticism and Power:** The detailed description of the stripping, the skin color ("wheat-colored"), and the buttocks ("like mandolins") clearly points to an eroticized subtext intended for a (likely male) audience of pulp magazines.
*   **Nihilism and Guilt:** Aki’s internal monologue at the end shifts the tone from sensationalism to a darker, post-war nihilism. She realizes that the "happiness" she envies doesn't exist and that she is essentially hurting herself by hurting Miyo.
*   **Masochistic Turn:** The ending, where Aki wishes to take Miyo's place, suggests a psychological collapse where the boundary between the victim and the victimizer disappears.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Fiction.
*   **Genre:** Ero-Guro (Erotic Grotesque), School Drama, Thriller.
*   **Themes:** Corporal punishment, hazing, student life, post-war nihilism, psychological trauma, voyeurism.
*   **Classification:** Mature (depicts non-consensual stripping and physical violence).
