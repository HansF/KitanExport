四、

「大丈夫、二三日さ、そんなに困るなら、こんな事止（や）めればいゝじゃないか」
「ではどうして食べてゆくの、三下（さんした）女優の月給じや十日しか食べられないわ。此処（ここ）は澤（たくさん）お金頂けるけれど、一週間に一度だし、それに競爭者も多いわ。どうすればいゝの？」
まだ若い、恐らく二十才（はたち）にはなつていないだらう女の思いがけない口調に、私は言う言葉もなかつた。

「先生！早く来てッ大変よ」
顔色を蒼白（あおじろ）にし女が荒々しく肩で息をしながら醫務室（いむしつ）へとび込んで来た。もう十時過ぎだつた。
「どうしたのだ？落ち着いて」
私はお客の腦溢血（のういっけつ）くらいだらうと思いながら急救箱（きゅうきゅうばこ）を肩にして、その女の後から地下へ下りた。
廊下を小走りに例の寝室の前に来た。
「何処（どこ）の部屋だい？」
「其處（そこ）と違うの、もつと奥なの」
女は焦（あせ）つて私をせかした。その廊下を突き當（あ）つて右へ折れた所に五つばかりの部屋が並んでいた。
「ここよ」
「あッ」
女の指差した部屋のカーテンを押しのけた瞬間、私は思わず目を掩（おお）つて、だしぬけ〜となつた。
部屋の片隅のベットには革（かわ）の帯で後ろ手に縛られた女が背中一面をミミズ腫（ば）れにされたまゝ気絶していた。

私はすぐ女に人工呼吸を施してカンフルを射つた。
暫（しばら）くして女は気がつくと体温も上昇し出した。
「どうしたのです？」
傍に立つて心配そうに見入つていた先刻（さっき）の女に訊（たず）ねた。
「えゝ、此の人のお相手の方、時々こうなんで困りますわ」
あらわれもない自分の姿に気がついて、気狂いのように泣きじやく女を抱えて別室のベットで安靜にさすと、さつき私を呼びに来た女と共に廊下に出た。

ホールや各個室では、何事もなかつたように、くすぐる様な嬌聲（きょうせい）が高く洩（も）れてくる。
それ以上は私にはもう正視に堪（た）えなかつた。この情痴（じょうち）の世界に耽溺（たんでき）するのでなければ、如何（いか）に神経の太い人間であつても、もう此れ以上にゝゝ止（とど）まる事は出来ないであろう。
この奥には、更に刺戟（しげき）の強い爛（ただ）れるような歓楽（かんらく）の秘境があらゆる設備を誇つて対岸の色街（いろまち）迄（まで）続いているという女の話にも、私はもう見る気力も失せて夢遊病者のように、ふらふらと入口の方へ歩いて行つた。

鳴りもせぬ三味線（しゃみせん）を、無雑作（むぞうさ）に抱えて、ちび下駄（げた）はいて一人前以上の稼（かせ）ぎをした、そして母親に皆（みな）とられて犬か猫の様に食べさせてもらうだけだつた
この頃から戦争はだんだん激しくなり、藝者（げいしゃ）の引き抜き、日本髪（にほんがみ）が禁止になり、果ては花街（かがい）の女は徴用（ちょうよう）され、火の消えた様な淋（さび）しい街になつてしまつた。
燈火管制（とうかかんせい）がきびしくなり、夜店は禁止され、お里（さと）は稼げなくなつた。人通りのない公園の角で、ぽつんと立つたままお里は動かなかつた。
悪夢の様な戦争は、終止符（しゅうしふ）を打たれた。街は見目麗（みめうるわ）しく復興した。お里はどうしたか。
十年一昔、まして流れの早い花街なれば、もうお里の事を知つている人はいない。たまたま知つている人があつても多くの人に感動を與（あた）える余裕がもうなかつた、彼女の事を言う人もなく見むきもされなくなつた。
終戦後、鶴橋（つるはし）のヤミ市（いち）は一躍名を賣（う）つた。大阪中から人が寄り、賣り込み買い込みで賑（にぎ）わつた。煙草（たばこ）賣りや闇賣りの子供が、道行く人を呼び止める。
その雑沓（ざっとう）の中でお里が坐（すわ）つていた。あのボロ三味線はどうしたのか、前よりうす汚（ぎたな）い木綿の着物のハッ口（ぐち）に両手を入れて、置き物の様に、ちつと坐つていた。相變（あいかわ）らずのいがぐり頭で――
うす汚い乞食（こじき）になつてまで生きていかねばならないあわれな人、敗戦に荒んだ人達はお里を見返る余裕すらなかつた。路傍（ろぼう）の石は聲（こえ）を出さずにうずくまつていた。
黒髪長く美しい女に生れなかつたら、彼女はこんなにならなかつたのに、古い女と言い捨てるには、あまりに悲しい人だつた。
彼女がヤミ市のガード下に坐つているのを見たのは、その日一日だけで、再び見られなかつた。そして彼女は、世間の視野から記憶から消えて行こうとしている。

四、
「大丈夫、二、三日さ。そんなに困るなら、こんなことやめればいいじゃないか」
「ではどうして食べていくの。三下女優の月給じゃ十日しか食べられないわ。ここはたくさんお金をいただけるけれど、一週間に一度だし、それに競争者も多いわ。どうすればいいの？」

女の指し示した部屋のカーテンを押し退けた瞬間、私は思わず目を覆って、立ちすくんでしまった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Fiction Section]**
4.
"It is okay, [only] 2-3 days. If [you are] that troubled, why not quit this kind of thing?"
"Then how [shall I] eat to live? A bottom-tier actress's monthly salary [can only] eat for ten days. Here [I] can receive much money, but it is once a week, and besides, competitors are many. What should [I] do?"
To the unexpected tone of the woman who was still young, probably not yet twenty years old, I had no words to say.

"Doctor! Come quickly, it is terrible!"
Turning her face pale, a woman breathing wildly with her shoulders rushed into the medical room. It was already past ten o'clock.
"What happened? Calm down."
I, thinking it was probably a customer's cerebral hemorrhage or something, put the first-aid kit on my shoulder and followed the woman down to the basement.
Running down the hallway, we came to the front of the usual bedrooms.
"Which room is it?"
"It is different from there, it is further back."
The woman, being impatient, hurried me. At the place where that hallway ended and turned right, about five rooms were lined up.
"Here."
"Ah!"
The moment [I] pushed aside the curtain of the room indicated by the woman, I unintentionally covered my eyes and became [stunned].
On the bed in the corner of the room, a woman tied with her hands behind her back with leather belts was unconscious, her entire back covered in welts.

I immediately performed artificial respiration on the woman and injected camphor.
After a while, when the woman regained consciousness, her body temperature also began to rise.
"What happened?"
I asked the woman from earlier who was standing nearby looking in worriedly.
"Yes, this person's partner, sometimes [he is] like this. It is a problem."
Holding the woman who, noticing her own exposed state, was sobbing like a crazy person, and making her rest on a bed in a separate room, I went out into the hallway with the woman who had come to call me earlier.

From the hall and individual rooms, as if nothing had happened, tickling-like flirtatious voices leaked out loudly.
More than that was no longer bearable for me to look at directly. Unless one is addicted to this world of carnal passion, no matter how thick-skinned a person is, one cannot stay here any longer than this.
To the woman's story that further inside, even more strongly stimulating, festering secret regions of pleasure boasted all sorts of facilities and continued to the red-light district on the opposite shore, I had already lost the will to see, and like a sleepwalker, I walked unsteadily toward the entrance.

**[Section 4: The Underground Clinic]**
"It's only for two or three days. If it's this difficult for you, why don't you just quit this business?"
"And how would I eat? A bit-part actress's salary barely buys ten days of food. I can make good money here, but the work only comes once a week, and there's so much competition. What else am I supposed to do?"
I was left speechless by the blunt, weary tone of the woman—she was young, likely not even twenty.

"Doctor! Come quickly! It's terrible!"
A woman, her face ashen and gasping for breath, burst into the infirmary. It was already past ten at night.
"What’s wrong? Calm down."
Assuming it was just a customer having a stroke, I slung my medical kit over my shoulder and followed her down to the basement. We hurried down the hall toward the bedrooms.
"Which room?" I asked.
"Not that one—further back!"
She urged me on, frantic. At the end of the hall, we turned right, where a row of five rooms stood.
"In here!"
"Good God..."
The moment I pulled back the curtain, I instinctively shielded my eyes, paralyzed by the sight. In the corner of the room, a woman lay unconscious on a bed. Her hands were bound behind her with leather straps, and her entire back was a mass of angry, red welts.

I immediately began artificial respiration and administered a camphor shot. After a while, she regained consciousness, and her color began to return.
"What happened here?" I asked the other woman, who stood by watching with a look of deep concern.
"Well... her 'partner' gets like this sometimes. It's quite a problem, really."
The victim, realizing her state of undress, began to sob hysterically. I helped her to a bed in a separate room to rest, then stepped back into the hallway with the woman who had summoned me.

From the main hall and the private rooms, flirtatious laughter drifted out as if nothing had happened. I couldn't bear to look at it any longer. Unless you are completely drowned in this world of carnal obsession, no soul, however hardened, could stand to stay here. The woman told me that deeper inside lay even more perverse "pleasure dens" with every luxury imaginable, stretching all the way to the red-light districts on the other side. But I had lost the will to see any more. Like a sleepwalker, I stumbled toward the exit.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into two main horizontal registers. The top half is dedicated to a fictional narrative (Part IV of a series), accompanied by a provocative line drawing. The bottom half contains a continuation of a different article and a small "advice" sidebar.
*   **Typography:** The text is set in traditional vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface typical of mid-century printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration of a woman in bondage serves as the primary "hook" for the page, characteristic of the *Kasutori* (pulp) genre. The title of the story is simply a large numeral "四" (Four).
*   **Illustration:** The drawing is eroticized and sensationalist, depicting a woman tied up, which directly correlates to the "welts on the back" mentioned in the text. This "SM" (sadomasochism) theme was a staple of underground post-war magazines.
*   **Sidebars:** The "Temptation Repelling Method" is boxed off, providing a visual break and a "lifestyle tip" for working-class women of the era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text likely comes from a "Kasutori" magazine. These were cheap, tawdry publications that flourished during the Occupation of Japan (1945–1952). They were known for 3-S content: Sports, Screen, and Sex (often including "grotesque" or "perverse" elements).
*   **Post-War Poverty:** The dialogue about "three-tier actresses" (bit players) not being able to afford food highlights the desperate economic situation of the late 1940s. Many women were forced into the "underground" sex trade or "Pan-pan" girl lifestyle to survive.
*   **Medical Context:** "Camphor" (*kanfuru*) was commonly used in literature of this era as a "miracle" stimulant for someone who had fainted or was dying.
*   **Tsuruhashi Black Market:** The bottom text mentions the Tsuruhashi *Yami-ichi* (black market) in Osaka. Tsuruhashi remains a famous area today (known for its Korean community), but in the immediate post-war years, it was a lawless, bustling hub for illegal trade and survival.
*   **Social Morality:** The advice box suggests that a woman can avoid a boss's unwanted advances by acting "insane" or claiming to be a "Christian," suggesting that in that era, religious devotion was seen as a barrier to sexual solicitation.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **三下女優 (Sanshita Joyū):** Literally "third-rate" or "bottom-tier" actress. Refers to bit-part players with very low pay.
*   **カンフル (Kanfuru):** Camphor. Used as a cardiac stimulant. In modern Japanese, "kanfuru-zai" is also a metaphor for an emergency economic stimulus.
*   **嬌聲 (Kyōsei):** A flirtatious or coquettish voice/scream, often associated with the sounds of a brothel or red-light district.
*   **情痴 (Jōchi):** Blind love, infatuation, or carnal lust.
*   **徴用 (Chōyō):** Conscription or forced labor. The text refers to women in the entertainment districts being drafted for labor during WWII.
*   **ハッ口 (Hakkuchi):** The "side-slits" of a kimono sleeve (usually *furiyatsu-kuchi* or similar).
*   **いがぐり頭 (Igaguri-atama):** A "chestnut burr" haircut; a very short, buzzed hairstyle, often indicating poverty or a lack of grooming for a woman of that era.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eroticism and Violence:** The story blends medical drama with "Abnormal Sexuality" (*hentai seiyoku*), a popular theme in post-war pulps. The detailed description of the welts and the binding is intended to titillate the reader.
*   **The "Sensible" Narrator vs. The "Decadent" World:** The narrator (a doctor) acts as a moral compass, expressing disgust at the "pleasure dens." This allows the reader to consume the erotic content while maintaining a sense of moral superiority.
*   **Post-War Nihilism:** The description of the woman O-sato in the bottom text reflects the "burnt-out" feeling of the era—people are too busy surviving to care about a former entertainer-turned-beggar.
*   **Gender and Survival:** Both the fiction and the essay emphasize that for women, beauty is a curse that leads to exploitation, but the lack of it (or the loss of it) leads to invisible poverty.
