## 1️⃣ Original Japanese
それは、良子の母親が、ひきとつて養育している、親戚の不幸な女の、私生児で、とても可愛い赤坊であつた。
ちょうど、みんな留守で、良子だけがいて、守りをしている筈なので、どうしたのだろうかと思つて、階下に降りてみた。
階下は、がらんとして真暗であつた。
赤坊の泣声は、良子の部屋から聞えていた。
「どうしたの？」
返事がないので、障子を開けてみた
真暗な部屋の中に、赤坊だけが寝かされているのだろうと思つたのであつた。
ところが、月明りにすかしてみるといないと思つた良子が、赤坊を抱いて柱に凭れているそして、わたしの入つてきたのには気がつかないらしく、映画でみた接吻の場面を、しきりに試演しているのだった。
赤坊は、息が苦しいのだろう、激しくもがいて泣き叫んでいるのに、彼女、そんなことなんかお構いなしに、夢中になつている。まるで、気狂いのようであつた。
わたしは、みているのがなんだか恐ろしくなつて、慌てゝ障子を閉めた。が、その音に、彼女は気がついてやめたのか、赤坊の泣声は、それつきり止んでしまった。
その夜、わたしは、奇妙な夢をみた。なんだか、赤坊や、映画や、色んなものゝ交錯した夢であつたが、どうしたことか、わたしは、身もだえして逃がれようとしている良子を、無理矢理に抱きすくめ、彼女の唇を、夢中になつて吸つていた。
彼女は、ひどく怒つて、泣き出し、髪をふり乱し、指帶でいきなりわたしの喉を締めつけた。わたしは、その苦しさに堪えかねて、うわんうわん叩いているときに目が覚めた。

　　　　　**三、夢と現実**

翌朝、わたしはその夢のことなんか口外するつもりはなかつたのに、どうしたはずみか、食事を報せにきた良子に、つい、うつかりと喋つてしまつたのだ。
彼女は、黙つて聞いていた。が、それつきり、おそろろしく怒つたような顔をして、考えこんでしまい、食事のときにも俯向きがちに黙りこんだまま、碌々（ろくろく）飲も食べなかつた。
そして、その日に限つて、赤坊の守りをするどころか、近寄ろうともしなかつた。
わたしは、しまつたことをしたと後悔した。が、いまさらどうにもならなかつた。
その日は、いちにち外出せず、二階に閉じこもつていた
あんな夢の話をしたばかりに、彼女の機嫌をすつかり損ねてしまつたのだ。良子にはもちろん、母親にも、なんといってお詫びをしたものだろうかとそればかり考えて苦しんだ。
夏休みは、まだ半分残つていたが、思いきつて東京へ帰ろうかとも思つた。
しかし、このまま帰つてしまったらこれからさき、どんな永い間悲しまなければならないことだろう、そんなことになつてしまつた以上、そう簡単に良子が忘れられるものではない、しかし相手はまだ十六の少女ではないか。
そんなことを考えながら、寢台（しんだい）に寝そべつていたが、そのまま、いつの間にか眠つたらしく、ふと、なにかの物音で目を覚ました。
誰かが足音を忍ばせて、二階へあがつてきたらしい気配を感じたのだ。
「だれ？」
返事がなかつたが背後に人のいるのを感じて振り向いた。
良子が立つていた。
彼女は、さつきから、わたしの寢台の緣（ふち）に腰をかけて、わたしの寢顔をじつとみつめていたらしい。
「どうしたの？」
「なぜ、晝（ひる）の邪魔をしにきたの？」
「――」
「なにか用？――朝の話でまだ怒つてるの？――ゆるしてくれね」
「なぜ、あんなひどいこというの」
「え？」
「あたしが、首を締めたなんていうでしよう」
「あれは夢の話だから――」
「あたしも夢をみたわ――」
そういつて、良子は、眞赤な顔をして唇を嚙みしめた。涙をこらえているようたのだ。
「どんな夢みたの？」
わたしが訊くと
「しらないッ」
そういつて良子は、シーツを乱暴に摑みあげたかと思うと、それで、すつぽり顔を掩うて俯向いてしまった。
わたしは、胸がドキドキしてきた。
「良子さんッ」
呼んでも、顔を出そうとしない。傍へいざり寄り、ヴェールを引き剥（む）こうとした。しかし彼女は、しつかり掴んでいて、どんなに引張つても放そうとしなかつた。
「良子さん」
わたしは、無性に可愛くなつて、いきなり良子を抱き寄せた。
ヴェールが、はらりと落ちた。
良子は、陶然として眼を閉じ、半開きの唇が、あえいでいた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
That was, Ryoko's mother, took in and is raising, a relative's unfortunate woman's, illegitimate child, a very cute baby it was.
Just then, everyone [was] away, Ryoko only was there, babysitting she should be doing, so what happened I wondered, to downstairs I went.
Downstairs was, empty and pitch dark it was.
The baby's crying voice was, from Ryoko's room heard.
"What happened?"
A reply not being, the shoji I opened.
In the pitch dark room, the baby only was laid [to sleep] I thought it was.
However, in the moonlight peeking through, not there I thought Ryoko was, the baby holding, against a pillar leaning. And, my entering she did not notice it seems, in a movie seen kiss scene, intently practicing she was.
The baby, breathing painful it must be, violently struggling and screaming it is, but she, such things not caring at all, absorbed she is. Just like, a crazy person she was.
I, watching was somehow scary became, in a hurry the shoji closed. But, at that sound, she noticed and stopped perhaps, the baby's crying, that was all and stopped.
That night, I, a strange dream saw. Somehow, the baby, movies, various things mixed dream it was, but for some reason, I, writhing and trying to escape Ryoko, by force embraced, her lips, absorbed I was sucking.
She, very angry, started crying, hair disheveled, with a sash suddenly my throat strangled. I, that pain unable to bear, "wan-wan" hitting when eyes opened.

**3. Dream and Reality**

The next morning, I that dream's thing at all to speak out intent was not, but by some fluke, the meal to announce came Ryoko to, accidentally blurted out.
She, silently was listening. But, that was all, terribly angry-like face doing, became lost in thought, during the meal also looking downward silently remaining, hardly drank or ate.
And, on that day specifically, baby's care doing far from, trying to approach even did not.
I, a bad thing did I regretted. But, now too late anything couldn't be done.
That day, all day not going out, in the second floor shut myself in.
Such dream story told because, her mood completely spoiled I had. To Ryoko of course, to the mother also, what saying apology should do I that only thinking suffered.
Summer vacation, still half remained, but decisively to Tokyo return I thought.
However, like this if returned from now on, what a long time sad must be, such a thing happened since, so easily Ryoko forgotten cannot be. But the opponent still sixteen's girl is she not.
Such things thinking while, on the bed was lying, as it was, before I knew it slept it seems, suddenly, some noise by eyes opened.
Someone footsteps hushed, second floor to come up seemed sign I felt.
"Who?"
Reply was not but behind person being felt and turned around.
Ryoko was standing.
She, for a while, my bed's edge on sitting, my sleeping face intently watching had been it seems.
"What happened?"
"Why, noon's interference to do did you come?"
"—"
"Some business? — Morning's talk about still angry are you? — Forgive me."
"Why, such a cruel thing do you say."
"Eh?"
"I, the neck strangled you say, right."
"That was a dream's talk because—"
"I too a dream saw—"
So saying, Ryoko, bright red face doing lips bit. Tears holding back it seemed.
"What kind of dream did you see?"

So saying Ryoko, the sheet violently grabbed up I thought, with that, completely face covered and looked down.
I, chest pounding became.
"Ryoko-san!"
Even if called, face to show does not. To side edge closer, the veil (sheet) try to strip off I did. However she, firmly holding, no matter how much pulled would not let go.
"Ryoko-san."
I, intensely [she] became cute/dear, suddenly Ryoko embraced.
The veil, fluttering fell.
Ryoko, entranced eyes closed, half-opened lips, were gasping.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
The baby was the illegitimate child of an unfortunate woman related to Ryoko’s mother, who had taken the child in to raise. It was a very sweet-looking infant. One day, while everyone was out and Ryoko was supposed to be babysitting alone, I grew concerned and went downstairs to check on them. 

The ground floor was hollow and pitch black. I could hear the baby crying from Ryoko’s room. "Is something wrong?" I asked. Receiving no answer, I slid open the shoji. I had expected to find the baby lying alone in the dark, but instead, I saw Ryoko in the moonlight. She was leaning against a pillar, clutching the baby. Unaware that I had entered, she was intently reenacting a kiss scene she must have seen in a movie. The baby was screaming and struggling for breath, but she was so absorbed in her fantasy that she seemed completely oblivious. She looked almost possessed.

Terror seized me, and I hurriedly slid the door shut. Perhaps the sound startled her, for the baby’s crying abruptly ceased. That night, I had a strange, feverish dream—a chaotic blur of the baby and the cinema. In the dream, I found myself forcibly embracing Ryoko as she writhed to escape, and I kissed her with a desperate intensity. She flew into a rage, her hair disheveled, and suddenly began to strangle me with a sash. I was gasping for air, pounding my fists in agony, when I finally jolted awake.

**III. Dream and Reality**

The next morning, I had no intention of mentioning the dream, but for some reason, when Ryoko came to call me for breakfast, I let it slip. She listened in silence. From that moment on, her expression turned terrifyingly cold. She retreated into herself, barely eating or drinking a thing at breakfast. That day, she wouldn't even go near the baby, let alone care for it. I was filled with regret for my thoughtless words, but the damage was done.

I spent the entire day holed up in my room on the second floor. I was miserable, wondering how I could ever apologize to her or her mother for such an indiscretion. There was still half of summer vacation left, but I seriously considered cutting it short and returning to Tokyo. Yet the thought of leaving things like this was unbearable; I knew I wouldn't be able to forget her so easily. After all, she was only a girl of sixteen.

As I lay brooding on my bed, I must have drifted off. I was awakened by the sound of muffled footsteps coming up the stairs. "Who’s there?" I asked. There was no reply, but sensing someone behind me, I turned around. It was Ryoko. She had been sitting on the edge of my bed, watching me sleep.

"What is it?" I asked.
"Why did you come to interfere with me this afternoon?" 
I was silent.
"Do you want something? Are you still angry about what I said this morning? I'm sorry."
"Why did you say such a cruel thing?" she asked.
"Eh?"
"Saying that I strangled you..."
"That was just a dream, Ryoko."
"I had a dream too," she said, her face flushing deep red as she bit her lip to hold back tears.
"What kind of dream?"
"I won't tell you!" she cried, suddenly grabbing the sheet and pulling it over her head, burying her face.

My heart began to race. "Ryoko!" I called, but she wouldn't show her face. I moved closer and tried to pull the sheet away, but she held on tight, refusing to let go. Suddenly overwhelmed by a surge of affection, I pulled her into my arms. The sheet fell away. Her eyes were closed in a trance, and her half-parted lips were trembling for breath.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is formatted in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tategaki*), reading from right to left.
*   **Structure:** The page represents the conclusion of a story, indicated by the "――完――" (End) marker at the bottom left. It is divided into two sections by a sub-header: "三、夢と現実" (3. Dream and Reality), which is centered and bolded.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style, typical of mid-century printing. It uses some older kanji forms (kyūjitai) and specific kana conventions (like the repetition mark ゝ in 慌てゝ).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The sub-header provides a clear break in the narrative. The page number "(69)" is placed at the bottom center.
*   **Illustration:** There is a stylized line-art illustration showing a man and a woman in a dramatic, intimate confrontation. The man is looking down or away, while the woman looks up at him, capturing the tension of the scene described in the text.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Long dashes (em-dashes) are used for pauses in dialogue, and quotation marks (brackets 「 」) denote speech.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era (Post-war 1940s-1950s):** The setting involves a student or young man visiting relatives in the countryside during "Summer Vacation" and considering returning to "Tokyo." This dynamic—the urban intellectual visiting the rural home—is a staple of Japanese "I-novels" (*shishōsetsu*) of the early to mid-20th century.
*   **Domestic Life:** Mention of *shoji* (sliding paper doors) and *shindai* (a western-style bed) suggests a household in transition between traditional Japanese living and modern Western influences.
*   **Social Taboos:** The mention of an "illegitimate child" (*shiseiji*) and an "unfortunate woman" reflects the social stigmas of the era. The girl Ryoko, at 16, is portrayed at the threshold of womanhood, experimenting with adult concepts like "kissing scenes" from movies, which were becoming a significant cultural influence in post-war Japan.
*   **Cinema Influence:** The girl’s attempt to mimic a kiss scene from a movie highlights the impact of Western (likely American) cinema on the youth of the period.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **赤坊 (Akabō):** An older term for "baby" (modern: *akachan*). It can sound slightly more objective or less sentimental.
*   **私生児 (Shiseiji):** "Illegitimate child." A term carrying significant social weight in the mid-20th century.
*   **試演 (Shien):** Rehearsal or trial performance. Here used to describe Ryoko practicing a kiss.
*   **指帶 (Shidai):** Likely referring to a *date-jime* or a thin undersash for a kimono. The use of this to "strangle" in a dream adds a tactile, traditional Japanese element to the nightmare.
*   **碌々 (Rokuroku):** Usually used in the negative (碌々〜ない) to mean "hardly," "barely," or "not properly."
*   **いざり寄り (Izari-yori):** To move closer while sitting/kneeling without standing up. A specific type of movement common on tatami floors.
*   **陶然 (Tōzen):** Entranced, enchanted, or in a state of rapture/intoxication.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Blurring of Dream and Reality:** The title "Dream and Reality" and the revelation that both characters had similar dreams suggest a psychological or even supernatural connection. The narrator’s dream of assaulting Ryoko is mirrored by her dream/reaction, suggesting shared subconscious desires or fears.
*   **Awakening Sexuality:** The story centers on the 16-year-old Ryoko’s budding sexuality. Her "rehearsal" of a kiss with a baby (disturbing by modern standards) and her later confrontation with the narrator represent the messy, often confusing transition from childhood to adulthood.
*   **Guilt and Repression:** The narrator feels immediate guilt for sharing his dream, recognizing the impropriety of it given Ryoko's age. The tension between his "rational" self (wanting to apologize and leave for Tokyo) and his "instinctive" self (embracing her at the end) drives the narrative.
*   **The "Uncanny" (*Fushigi*):** The atmosphere is heavy with the "uncanny"—the dark house, the crying baby, the strange behavior by the pillar, and the hushed footsteps at night.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story (Conclusion)
*   **Genre:** Psychological Drama, Romantic Fiction, "I-Novel" (*Shishōsetsu*) style.
*   **Themes:** Coming of age, subconscious desires, dreams vs. reality, domestic tension, post-war social dynamics.
*   **Classification:** Literary.
