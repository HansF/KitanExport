## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Episode 2: The Great Master of Eight Trigrams]**
"How about it, among the gathered crowd, there must be those born in the Year of the Boar. Listen well. To begin with, speaking of this Year of the Boar, just as the name represents the body, once they have made up their mind, even through fire or water, whether arrows come or guns come, they have a personality that recklessly advances toward what they believe. If they succeed, they surely become the lord of a country and a castle, but if they fail, the danger of destroying their own self is also great. Among those born in the Year of the Boar are Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Saigo Takamori, and recently, Iwasaki Yataro of Mitsubishi..."
Whether it was a lie or the truth I don't know, but the one rattling on with a refreshing tone of eloquence was a fortune teller with the usual amber-colored crested haori coat and hakama, growing a goat-beard on his chin. The place was the Tenroku shopping district in Northern Osaka's busy quarter. It was a clear autumn Sunday morning, and foot traffic was still sparse. On the road in front of a shack-like fortune-telling booth that looked like it would blow away instantly if the wind blew, he spread a paper the size of a newspaper with the twelve zodiac signs drawn on it. While pointing at the signs one by one with a "Chaplin-preferred?" cane, he talked and talked eloquently. In front of this man, only one old man in a casual kimono with a "tea-kettle head" (bald on top) but with a black beard on his chin was listening intently.
I, who had come out intended to have a glass of shochu for the first time in a while and perhaps peek at a "woman's swordplay" play on the way back, stopped to listen to this fortune teller's explanation to kill time. Before I knew it, the crowd grew by one then two, and by the time thirty minutes passed, I was in the very front row, with fourteen or fifteen bored-looking faces lined up behind me.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Episode 2: The Grand Master of Fortune**
"Tell me now, surely some of you good people were born in the Year of the Boar? Listen closely! As the saying goes, 'the name reveals the soul,' and those born under the Boar are a singular breed. Once their minds are set, they’ll charge headlong through fire, water, arrows, or bullets to reach their goal. When they succeed, they become titans—masters of their own domains. But should they stumble, they risk utter self-destruction. Think of the greats: Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Saigo Takamori, and in our own time, the founder of Mitsubishi, Iwasaki Yataro..."

Whether he was spinning yarns or speaking gospel, I couldn’t say. The man held court with a silver tongue, dressed in the standard uniform of his trade: an amber-colored *haori* coat emblazoned with his family crest, traditional *hakama* trousers, and a wispy goatee. We were in the Tenroku shopping district in northern Osaka. It was a crisp, clear Sunday morning in autumn, and the streets were still waking up. He had spread a newspaper-sized chart of the zodiac on the pavement in front of a ramshackle booth that looked like a stiff breeze might carry it away. Waving a cane—supposedly the kind favored by Charlie Chaplin—he jabbed at the signs while holding forth with practiced ease. His only captive audience at first was an old man in a simple kimono; the fellow had a head as bald as a tea-kettle but sported a surprisingly lush black beard.

I’d come out for a rare treat: a few glasses of shochu and maybe a "women’s sword-fighting" show. Finding myself with time to kill, I stopped to listen. Before I knew it, a small crowd had gathered, and after thirty minutes, I found myself at the very front of a line of fifteen or so idle onlookers, all waiting to hear what destiny had in store.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into multiple narrative threads. The right column contains the tragic conclusion of "Episode 1," while the central and left sections start "Episode 2."
*   **Typography:** Vertical text orientation (*tate-gaki*). Uses historical kana orthography (e.g., 酔うて instead of 酔って, ぢや instead of じゃ). 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "第二話 八卦の大先生" is set in a larger, bolder font to denote the start of a new chapter. 
*   **Illustration:** A caricature-style line drawing signed "SANTO." It depicts the fortune teller (right) holding a cane and gesturing toward the narrator/protagonist (left), capturing the "street performance" vibe of the scene.
*   **Formatting:** The use of parentheses like `(次頁下段へ)` (To the bottom of the next page) indicates this was a serialized feature in a magazine.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s):** The mention of a "7,000 yen" monthly salary (top left) and "barracks" (*barakku* - temporary post-war shacks) firmly places this in the immediate post-WWII period. Inflation was rampant, and many people lived in makeshift housing.
*   **Tenroku (天六):** Short for Tenjinbashi-suji 6-chome in Osaka. Historically a bustling, gritty working-class district known for its markets and street life.
*   **Lumpen (ルンペン):** Derived from the German *Lumpenproletariat*, this was a common loanword in post-war Japan for the homeless, vagrants, or those without steady work.
*   **Adol (アドール錠):** A brand of sedative/sleeping pill (likely Adorm/phenobarbital). In the post-war "decadent" (*Buraiha*) literary era, suicide by overdose of such pills was a recurring theme in both fiction and reality.
*   **Onna Kengeki (女剣劇):** Popular stage entertainment featuring women performing stylized sword-fighting. It was a major draw for the working class in the mid-20th century.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **八卦 (Hakke):** Traditional divination based on the eight trigrams of the I Ching.
*   **一国一城の主 (Ikkoku Ichijō no Aruji):** Lit. "Lord of a province and a castle." An idiom for a self-made man who achieves great success and independence.
*   **着流し (Kinagashi):** Wearing a kimono casually without the formal *hakama*, often associated with a relaxed or slightly bohemian lifestyle.
*   **天眼鏡 (Tengenkyō):** An old-fashioned term for a magnifying glass used by fortune tellers to read palms.
*   **いい鴨 (Ii Kamo):** Lit. "A good duck." Idiom for an easy mark, a sucker, or someone easily swindled.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Hustle of Survival:** The fortune teller is a classic post-war street performer—part diviner, part entertainer, part scam artist. He uses historical figures (Yoshitsune, Saigo) to lend false authority to his claims.
*   **Contrast of Tones:** The page juxtaposes the lighthearted, cynical humor of the fortune-telling story with the dark, melodramatic tragedy on the right (suicide due to debt and social shaming). This reflects the volatile emotional landscape of post-war Japan.
*   **Social Realism:** References to "barracks," "money lenders," "foreclosure," and "shochu" paint a picture of a society struggling with poverty and the loss of dignity.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serialized Story, Periodical.
*   **Genre:** Satire, Social Realism, *Taishū Bungaku* (Popular Literature).
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Fortune Telling, Poverty, Osaka Dialect, Tragedy, Urban Life.
