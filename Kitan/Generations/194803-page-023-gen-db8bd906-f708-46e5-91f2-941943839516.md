思う位苦しかった戦争、悪夢のような三年間。従軍生活も敗戦と言うきっかけで結末をつけた。
送還された内地は、インフレの狂想曲におどる闇、窃盗、強盗殺人、強姦、ありとあらゆる醜い世相が、あたかも屠殺した牛馬の臓腑のようにさらけ出されていた。
正しく生きようとするには、余りにも住みにくい世の中であつた。
彼はじつと目を閉じた、彼の目の中に髣髴として浮かんで来た光景が走馬燈のように、行き過ぎてゆく。
蛙を追うて滑つてゆく青大将の頸筋をサツと握つて、一ふり二ふり、弱つたところをガブリと噛みついて頭から三寸も喰いちぎり、頸のつけ根から皮をむいて、臓物を出し、白い肉をムシャリムシャリと喰い始めた。破れた軍服に、素足の中ば出た軍靴、あごの不精人のような悲惨な姿、此所は南方戦線のジャングル内の敗残兵の姿ではない。
い。飽食、そうだ、彼はハタと膝をうつた。
「お願いします」
これが彼を獵奇座の座長たらしめた。えにし、であつた。
京都、大阪、神戸と各劇場を大入り満員にする大評判の美しい娘が蛇を喰う一座、グロ味には飽満している筈のさすがの都会人も、うーんと呻かさるを得なかつた。
酒井十九之助座長は神戸市のＳ劇場で惡食味を私にこう語つてくれた
「好きで蛇を食べるんですか、御冗談でしょう、今度の戦争に應召中食糧が欠乏して生死の中をさまよつている間に、つい蛙、百足、蛇、とかげに手を出すようになつたのです
三尺位のとかげを銃で射ち殺して夢中でむさぼり食べたのが病みつきで、そうですな鯨の堅い肉を食べているような味がします。少し泥臭いですが――百足は火、火にかけると足がバラバラに落ちてしまつて口に入れるとパリパリと美味しいものですわよ、そうです丁度栗を焼いて食べるようです。――蛇ですか、蛇は去年の三月から毎日一定か二疋を食べています。そうですな、もう五百か六百疋位食べたでしょう。蛇の供養塔ですつて、それも考えています。食べ方は背筋をこうゆう風に歯で噛みきつて綺麗に一皮むいて骨ごと食べるのです。五六寸、舞台では此れ以上はたべられません、時間的に出来得ない理由です。
困つた事には腹にかまれた蛇、背筋に寄生虫のいる蛇を喰いますと、腹が痛くて堪まりません。
サッと皮をむいて背筋に寄生虫を發見しても、それを取り除きながら食べなければならないところに舞台つとめの辛さがあります。
お客さんの方はそんな事はわかりませんし、
『早よう、喰わんかい』
と絶叫せられますから、悪いと知りつつついガブリとやるのです。
蛇を喰うのに抵抗力をつけるのですか、えゝそれはやります。やらないと身体がもたないので注射を打ちます。何の注射つて、それは御推量にまかせます。それから焼酎のきついのを飲みます。
蛇を何處から手に入れるかつてですが、まさか私が自分で捕りにも行けず蛇屋から買います。一匹二百五十円です。此の間寒いので炬燵の中にいれてやつたら元気を出して、いきなり背筋、噛みついて放れません。引つぱると創が大きくなりますから、こうして頭から三寸の處、こゝが蛇の急所ですからね、こうゆう風にひねりますと噛みついた奴が放しますよ。
こんな事で創のたえ間がありません、これ此の通りです。
蛇のうらみですつて、まさか。
蛇は骨肉が離れにくく、焼くと鰯の味です。内臓は捨てますが、肝は食います。蛇の肝はホルモン剤ですから……
蛇は動物性蛋白源ですから食つていますと肥る筈ですが痩せました。去年より一貫匁も、蛇では縞よりも青大将の方が味がよいようです。
こと迄語り続けた座長の紅潮した顔は妖氣に包まれているようだ。
やがて出番を知らせるベルがけたたましく鳴り響いた。
蛇と抱かれて寝る娘！
考えただけでもゾッとする身ふるいするグロ百パーセント！
美しい娘が首から、胴から、股から頭から蛇を出し狂うばかりの凄艶さ、やがてガブリと蛇を食う。
場内は割れんばかりの拍手喝采、大入り満員の盛況である。
娘姿に粉粧した座長が舞台裏へ歸つてきて言葉を続けて、利益金の一部は獄中で知り合つた更生の父、中山末吉氏の慈善事業に投ぜられていると言う美談を語つた。
私は獵奇座の多幸を祈りつつ、雑踏の街路へまぎれ込んだ。

思うほどに苦しかった戦争、悪夢のような三年間。従軍生活も敗戦というきっかけで結末をつけた。
送還された内地は、インフレの狂想曲に踊る闇、窃盗、強盗殺人、強姦、ありとあらゆる醜い世相が、あたかも屠殺した牛馬の臓腑のようにさらけ出されていた。
正しく生きようとするには、あまりにも住みにくい世の中であった。
彼はじっと目を閉じた。彼の目の中に髣髴（ほうふつ）として浮かんで来た光景が走馬灯のように、行き過ぎてゆく。
蛙を追って滑ってゆくアオダイショウの首筋をサッと握って、一振り二振り、弱ったところをガブリと噛みついて頭から三寸も食いちぎり、首の付け根から皮を剥いて、臓物を出し、白い肉をムシャリムシャリと食い始めた。破れた軍服に、素足が半分出た軍靴、あごの不精髭のような悲惨な姿。ここは南方戦線のジャングル内の敗残兵の姿ではない。

酒井十九之助座長は神戸市のＳ劇場で「悪食（あくじき）」について私にこう語ってくれた。
「好きで蛇を食べるんですか、ご冗談でしょう。今度の戦争に応召中、食糧が欠乏して生死の間をさまよっている間に、つい蛙、ムカデ、蛇、トカゲに手を出すようになったのです。
三尺（約90cm）ほどのトカゲを銃で射ち殺して夢中で貪り食べたのが病みつきで、そうですね、鯨の硬い肉を食べているような味がします。少し泥臭いですが……ムカデは火にかけると足がバラバラに落ちてしまって、口に入れるとパリパリと美味しいものですよ。そうです、ちょうど栗を焼いて食べるようです。蛇ですか？ 蛇は去年の三月から毎日、一、二匹を食べています。そうですね、もう五百か六百匹ほど食べたでしょう。蛇の供養塔ですか、それも考えています。食べ方は背筋をこういう風に歯で噛み切って、綺麗に一皮剥いて骨ごと食べるのです。五、六寸（約15〜18cm）、舞台ではこれ以上は食べられません。時間的に無理だからです。

蛇は骨と肉が離れにくく、焼くとイワシの味です。内臓は捨てますが、肝（きも）は食います。蛇の肝はホルモン剤ですから……。
蛇は動物性タンパク源ですから、食っていると太るはずですが、痩せました。去年より一貫匁（約3.75kg）も。蛇ではシマヘビよりもアオダイショウの方が味が良いようです」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The war which was as painful as I thought, the nightmare-like three years. The military service life also, with the occasion called defeat, brought to an end.
The returned homeland was, the darkness dancing to the rhapsody of inflation, theft, robbery-murder, rape, all sorts of ugly social conditions were, as if the internal organs of slaughtered cattle and horses, exposed.
To try to live correctly, it was an excessively difficult world to live in.
He tightly closed eyes; the scenes that came floating vividly in his eyes like a revolving lantern, went passing by.
The nape of a rat snake (Aodaisho) sliding while chasing a frog, quickly grasping, one shake, two shakes, the weakened part "chomp" biting, from the head three inches (sun) biting off, from the base of the neck peeling skin, taking out organs, the white meat "munch munch" started eating. In torn military uniform, army boots with bare feet halfway out, a miserable figure like an unkempt man's beard, this is not the figure of a defeated soldier inside the jungle of the Southern Front.
"...y. Satiety, that's it," he suddenly struck his knee.
"Please [let me join]."
This made him the leader of the Ryokiza (Bizarre Theater). It was "enishi" (fate/connection).
In Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, making each theater full-capacity to great reputation, "The troupe where a beautiful girl eats snakes," even the city people who should be satiated with "guro" (grotesque) taste, had no choice but to groan "Uuun."
Leader Tokunosuke Sakai, at Theater S in Kobe City, spoke to me about "akujiki" (eating disgusting things) like this:
"Do I eat snakes because I like them? You must be joking. During the conscription in this past war, while wandering between life and death due to food shortage, I accidentally came to lay hands on frogs, centipedes, snakes, lizards.
Killing a three-shaku (90cm) lizard with a gun and eating it frantically became a habit; yes, it tastes like eating tough whale meat. It's a bit muddy, but—centipedes, when put on fire, legs fall off scatteringly and when put in mouth, they are crunchy and delicious things, yes, just like eating roasted chestnuts. —Snakes? Snakes, since March last year, I eat one or two fixed amount every day. Yes, I have eaten about five hundred or six hundred probably. A memorial tower for snakes? I am considering that too. The way to eat is, the spine, like this, biting through with teeth, beautifully peeling one skin, eating with bones. Five or six sun (15-18cm), on stage more than this cannot be eaten, it's a reason of not being possible time-wise.
The troubling thing is, snakes that were bitten in the belly, or snakes with parasites in the spine, if I eat them, the stomach ache is unbearable.
Even if I quickly peel skin and find parasites in the spine, the hardship of the stage performance is in having to eat while removing them.
The customers don't know such things, and
'Hurry up, eat it!'
because they scream, while knowing it's bad, I accidentally go 'chomp.'
Do I build resistance for eating snakes? Yes, I do that. If I don't, the body won't hold up, so I take injections. What kind of injection? I leave that to your imagination. And then I drink strong shochu.
As for where I get snakes, surely I cannot go catch them myself, I buy from a snake shop. One is 250 yen. Recently, because it was cold, I put it in a kotatsu, it got energetic, and suddenly bit my spine [of the snake/back] and wouldn't let go. If I pull, the wound gets bigger, so like this, three sun from the head, because here is the snake's vital point, if you twist like this, the guy who bit will let go.
Because of such things, there is no end to wounds, look, it's like this.
Snake's grudge? No way.
Snake's bone and meat are hard to separate; when grilled, it tastes like sardines. Internal organs are thrown away, but I eat the liver. Because snake liver is a hormone supplement...
Because snakes are an animal protein source, I should get fat if I eat them, but I lost weight. One kanmonme (3.75kg) since last year. Among snakes, rather than striped snakes, rat snakes seem to taste better."
The flushed face of the leader who kept talking up to here seemed wrapped in a ghostly air (yoki).
Soon, the bell notifying the turn to go on stage rang noisily.
"The girl who sleeps embracing a snake!"
Just thinking about it makes one shudder, 100 percent guro!
The beautiful girl from the neck, from the torso, from the crotch, from the head, bringing out snakes, a beauty so eerie it's almost mad. Soon, "chomp," she eats the snake.
Inside the hall is applause like it would crack, the success of a packed house.
The leader, who had put on makeup (powdered) in a girl's figure, returned to the backstage and continued words, telling a moving story that part of the profits is being invested in the charity work of Mr. Suekichi Nakayama, the "Father of Rehabilitation" whom he met in prison.
I, while praying for the great fortune of Ryokiza, mingled into the crowded streets.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The war was every bit as agonizing as one might imagine—a three-year nightmare. My life as a soldier finally came to an end with the definitive stroke of defeat. 
Returning to the mainland, I found a society laid bare like the entrails of slaughtered livestock: a dark "Rhapsody of Inflation" where theft, armed robbery, murder, and rape danced in the shadows. It was a world far too harsh for anyone attempting to live a righteous life.
Closing my eyes, I watched the past flicker by like a revolving lantern. 
I saw a man snatch the neck of a Japanese rat snake as it glided after a frog. With a couple of sharp shakes to stun it, he bit down—*crunch*—tearing off three inches of its head. He peeled back the skin from the base of the neck, yanked out the guts, and began to ravenously chew the white flesh. Clad in a tattered uniform and boots with his bare toes poking through, he looked as wretched as a man with a month's worth of stubble. But this was no longer a vision of a defeated soldier in the jungles of the Southern Front.
"That’s it... satiety!" he thought, slapping his knee. "I'll do it."
That was the "kismet" that led him to become the leader of the *Ryokiza*—the "Theater of the Bizarre."

From Kyoto to Osaka and Kobe, the troupe became a sensation, packing every theater to the rafters with their headline act: "The Beautiful Girl Who Devours Snakes." Even city dwellers, long desensitized to the grotesque, couldn't help but groan in morbid fascination.
The troupe leader, Tokunosuke Sakai, spoke to me at Theater S in Kobe about his "vile diet."
"You think I eat snakes because I like them? Don't be ridiculous. During the war, while I was wandering between life and death due to food shortages, I found myself driven to eat frogs, centipedes, snakes, and lizards. I once shot a three-foot lizard and ate it in a frenzy; it became a habit. It tastes a bit like tough whale meat—earthy, but not bad. As for centipedes, if you roast them, the legs fall off, and they're as crunchy and delicious as toasted chestnuts. I’ve eaten one or two snakes every single day since last March—probably five or six hundred by now. I’ve even thought about building a memorial for them.
To eat them, you bite through the spine, peel the skin clean away, and eat it bone and all. On stage, I limit myself to about five or six inches; any more takes too much time. The real trouble is when the snake has been bitten or is riddled with parasites. It causes unbearable stomach pain. Even if I spot parasites while skinning them, the 'show must go on,' and the hardest part is picking them out while performing. The audience doesn't see that; they just scream, 'Hurry up and eat it!' so I just take a big bite, even knowing the risk.
I take injections to build up my resistance—I won't say what kind—and I drink incredibly strong *shochu*. Otherwise, my body wouldn't hold up. I buy the snakes from a dealer for 250 yen each. Once, when it was cold, I put a snake in my *kotatsu* to warm it up. It got so lively it bit me and wouldn't let go. If you pull, the wound just tears, so you have to twist it at the base of the skull—the vital point—until it releases. My hands are covered in scars from things like that. People ask about the 'snake's grudge,' but there’s no such thing. The meat is hard to pick off the bone, but once grilled, it tastes like sardines. I discard the guts, but I always eat the liver; it's like a natural hormone supplement. Snakes are high in protein, so I should be gaining weight, but I’ve actually lost several pounds. I find the rat snakes taste better than the striped ones."

As he spoke, the leader's flushed face seemed to glow with a supernatural, eerie energy. Suddenly, the stage bell clattered.
"The Girl Who Sleeps with Snakes!"
The mere thought was a shudder-inducing, hundred-percent "guro" spectacle. A beautiful girl appeared, draped in snakes—emerging from her collar, her sleeves, her lap—eerie and seductive in her madness. Then, with a sudden snap, she bit into one. 
The theater erupted in thunderous applause; it was a sold-out triumph.
The leader—who, I realized, was the "girl," heavily costumed and powdered—returned backstage. He added a final, touching note: a portion of the profits was donated to the charity work of Suekichi Nakayama, the "Father of Rehabilitation" whom the leader had met while in prison.
I stepped back out into the bustling streets, offering a silent prayer for the continued fortune of the *Ryokiza*.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Format and Layout
*   **Typography:** The text is set in a vertical orientation (tategaki), traditional for Japanese literature and journalism. The font is a standard Ming-cho (serif) style typical of mid-20th-century printing.
*   **Column Structure:** The page is divided into two main horizontal registers, with text flowing from top to bottom, right to left.
*   **Punctuation and Symbols:** Uses standard Japanese periods (。) and commas (、), as well as "hook" quotation marks (「」) for dialogue and (『』) for inner quotes or emphasis.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** There is no large title on this specific page, suggesting it is a continuation of a longer feature or a serialized essay. The page number "— 23 —" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Density:** The text is very dense with little white space, characteristic of pulp magazines or "Kasutori" magazines of the era, which maximized content on cheap paper.

### Design Features
*   The scan shows significant aging (foxing and yellowing), consistent with 1940s-1950s newsprint.
*   The use of furigana (reading aids) is minimal, suggesting an adult target audience with a certain level of literacy.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### The Post-War "Kyodatsu" State
The text describes the immediate aftermath of WWII (late 1940s). Japan was in a state of "Kyodatsu" (utter exhaustion and despair). The "Rhapsody of Inflation" refers to the hyperinflation that rendered the yen nearly worthless, leading to a thriving black market (*yami-ichi*) and widespread crime as people struggled to survive.

### Hikiagesha (Repatriates)
The narrator mentions "repatriated to the mainland" (*sokan sareta naichi*). Millions of Japanese soldiers and civilians returned from overseas territories (Manchuria, Southeast Asia) to a destroyed homeland, often bringing back "survival habits" like eating non-traditional animals learned during famines in the jungle.

### Kasutori Culture & "Guro" (Grotesque)
The late 1940s saw the rise of *Kasutori* magazines—cheap, lurid publications focusing on the "3 Ss": Speed, Sex, and Screen (or sensation). The term "Guro" (Grotesque) was part of the "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense) trend that originated in the 1920s and saw a dark resurgence after the war. People were fascinated by the macabre as a reflection of their own ruined lives.

### Misemono-goya (Sideshows)
The "Ryokiza" (猎奇座) mentioned is a type of *misemono-goya* (itinerant sideshow). These troupes performed shocking acts—snake swallowing, fire breathing, or displaying "freaks"—at shrines or in temporary theaters.

### Suekichi Nakayama
The text mentions Nakayama Suekichi, the "Father of Rehabilitation." This refers to a real historical figure who worked with ex-convicts. The mention of the troupe leader meeting him in prison suggests the leader had a criminal past, common among the marginalized people running these shows.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **青大将 (Aodaisho):** The Japanese Rat Snake (*Elaphe climacophora*). A common, non-venomous snake in Japan.
*   **三寸 (San-sun):** An old unit of measurement. 1 *sun* is approx. 3.03 cm, so 3 *sun* is about 9 cm.
*   **猟奇 (Ryoki):** Originally meaning "seeking the strange," it became a catch-all term for the bizarre, macabre, or grotesque.
*   **粉粧 (Funsho):** Literally "powdered and decorated." In this context, it refers to the male troupe leader wearing heavy makeup to perform as a "beautiful girl" (onnagata style).
*   **悪食 (Akujiki):** The practice of eating things considered disgusting or non-food by society (cannibalism, insects, etc.).
*   **ホルモン剤 (Horumon-zai):** In the mid-20th century, this wasn't just "hormone medication" but a general term for "stamina-building" or "invigorating" substances.
*   **貫匁 (Kanmonme):** An old weight unit. 1 *kan* = 3.75 kg.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

### Survival vs. Performance
The core irony of the text is that the leader's trauma—having to eat vermin to survive in the jungle—becomes his "act." He commodifies his desperation for an audience that is simultaneously horrified and entertained.

### The "Grotesque" as Catharsis
The audience's demand to "Hurry up and eat it!" reflects a societal bloodlust or a need for distraction from their own bleak postwar reality. The "Guro" act serves as a mirror to the "ugly social conditions" mentioned in the opening.

### Gender Ambiguity
The "beautiful girl" is actually a man in drag (the troupe leader). This adds a layer of artifice to the act—the "beauty" of the girl contrasts with the "ugliness" of the snake-eating, a classic Ero-Guro trope.

### Redemptive Narrative
The final paragraph attempts to "sanitize" the grotesque act by framing it as a charitable endeavor. By linking the "bizarre" performance to the "Father of Rehabilitation," the author provides a moral justification for what would otherwise be seen as low-brow, filthy entertainment.
