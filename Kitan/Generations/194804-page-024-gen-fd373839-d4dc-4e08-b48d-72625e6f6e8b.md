「……あたしより一つ上の二十（歳）、一人はおチヅ、本名は川田チヅ代、年はあたしと同い年の十九（歳）。」
「よし、素直に言ったな。よく網にかかるチンピラスリどもが鳴らしていた地下鉄の三人組スリはお前たちだったんだな。女学生や、オフィスガールや、女中なんかに変装して荒稼ぎをやっていた他に、まだまだ余罪があるだろう？」
「ええ、網棚の膨れた折り鞄の横に、用意していたトランクやバイオリンケースを並べて乗せ、持ち主が新聞や雑誌に夢中になっているときに素早くかっぱらいました。男なんか、どんなに年輩の紳士だって、若くて美しい娘がピッタリ身体に寄り添っていれば、たちまちボーッとしてしまいます。心もポケットも明けっ放し、網棚の上より、あたしたちの手を握ったりお尻を触るのに夢中になっちまうんですもの、仕事はとても気楽でした。」
「待て、男だって皆がそんなだらしない甘ちゃんではないぞ。」
「オホホホ、手強い相手なら、また方法があるのよ。混雑の中で、キャッと悲鳴を上げるとたちまち黒山のような野次馬が集まるわ。そしたら、目指す相手を前に置いて、握手したとか、お尻を撫でたとか、キスしたとか大声で難癖をつけるの。手強い男は真面目な石部金吉が多いのよ。その手には一も二もないわ。本当はそんなこと全く知らなくても、係わり合いになるのが嫌だから、結局、あたしの手にお金をつかませてコソコソ逃げ出すのが落ちさ。」
「うーむ、ゆすりもやったのか。それでは最後に、ざっくばらんに聞かせろ。そんなに男の気持ちを鋭く突き得るお前たちの正体は一体何者なのだ？」
「そら、とうとう江本さんも、あたしの仲間が聞く通りの質問をしたわ。オホホホ、一番可愛い色男の、南の三羽鳥の秀ちゃんだって明かしたことのない秘密を、口（くちは）で聞くつもりなの。白状するわ。その代わり、好きなラッキーストライクを一本吸わせてね。」
器用にパチリとライターを鳴らした。
「ああ、うまい。煙草も吸えない女学生なんかに化けたのが大失敗だったわ。あたしの正体はね、ウフフフ驚いちゃだめよ。今里遊郭の大新楼の接待婦、わかりやすく言えば女郎（オイラン）なんですよ。おキヨちゃんも、おチヅちゃんも同じ店にいる朋輩なのよ。」
「な、なんだって！女郎？そうか、女郎なら男を扱い慣れているからなあ。しかし女郎がなぜ変装してスリなどをやるんだい？」
「ふふふ、わからないかなあ。インフレで生活ができないからよ。あたしは去年十一月まで、丸二年も飛田遊郭招福楼で、肉を売って働いていました。地獄みたいな浅ましい商売なのです。それに、街のパンパンガールみたいに、手軽にインチキホテルへ客を誘い込むのと違って、女郎にはやっぱり昔のままの、格式や仁義があるの。部屋代、衣装代、それに激しく身体を使うためのいろんな飲食代、とてもたくさんのお金が要るのよ。あたしなど器量と腕じゃいつも店一番の収入を挙げたけれど、どうしても足りない。働いても働いて……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"...Twenty, one year older than me; one is O-Chizu, real name Kawada Chizuyo, age same as me, nineteen."
"Good, you spoke honestly. Those three-person subway pickpockets that the small-time crooks caught in the net were talking about, it was you guys, wasn't it? Besides making a killing disguised as schoolgirls, office girls, or maids, there must be more crimes, right?"
"Yes. Next to bulging folding bags on the luggage racks, we would place our prepared trunks or violin cases, and while the owners were absorbed in newspapers or magazines, we quickly snatched them. Men, no matter how elderly a gentleman, if a young and beautiful girl nestles right up against them, they immediately become dazed. Both their hearts and pockets are left wide open; they get so absorbed in holding our hands or touching our behinds instead of the luggage rack, so the work was very easy."
"Wait, even men aren't all such slovenly softies."
"Ohohoho, if it's a tough opponent, there's another way. In a crowd, if I let out a 'Kyaa!' scream, a mountain of onlookers gathers instantly. Then, placing the target in front of me, I make false accusations loudly, like they shook my hand, stroked my behind, or kissed me. Tough men are often serious 'Ishibe Kinkichi' types. Against that tactic, they have no choice. Even if they truly know nothing of such things, because they hate getting involved, in the end, they press money into my hand and sneak away; that's how it drops (ends)."
"Hmm, so you did extortion too. Then finally, tell me frankly. Who on earth are you, who can so sharply pierce the feelings of men?"
"There, finally Mr. Emoto, you asked the question my comrades said you would. Ohohoho, even for the cutest handsome man, Hide-chan of the 'Three Birds of Minami,' I wouldn't reveal this secret, but you want to hear it from my mouth? I'll confess. In exchange, let me smoke one of my favorite Lucky Strikes."
She deftly made a 'click' with a lighter.
"Ah, delicious. Pretending to be a schoolgirl who can't even smoke was a big mistake. My true identity is—u-fufu, don't be surprised. I'm a hostess from the Daishin-ro in the Imazato Quarters; to put it simply, a prostitute (Oiran). O-Kiyo-chan and O-Chizu-chan are also colleagues in the same shop."
"Wh-what! A prostitute? I see, if you're a prostitute, you're used to handling men. But why does a prostitute disguise herself and do pickpocketing?"
"Huhu, don't you understand? It's because we can't make a living due to inflation. Until last November, for two full years, I was selling my meat at the Shofuku-ro in the Tobita Quarters. It's a shameful business like hell. And, unlike the street-walking 'Panpan girls' who easily lure customers into fake hotels, for a prostitute, there are still the old-fashioned formalities and codes of honor. Room fees, clothing fees, and various food and drink costs for using the body intensely—a great deal of money is required. Even with my looks and skill, I always brought in the top income in the shop, but it's never enough. No matter how much I work..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"...One of them is twenty, a year older than me. The other is O-Chizu—real name Chizuyo Kawada—who is nineteen, the same age as I am."
"Good. I'm glad you're being straight with me," the detective replied. "So it was your trio the petty thieves were whispering about—the 'Subway Three' who’ve been cleaning up while disguised as schoolgirls, office clerks, and maids. I assume there are more crimes to account for?"
"Oh, yes," she answered. "We’d set down our own trunks or violin cases on the racks right next to someone’s bulging briefcase. While the owners were buried in their newspapers or magazines, we’d make our move. Men are so predictable; even the most distinguished older gentleman loses his head the moment a pretty young thing presses up against him. They leave their hearts and their pockets wide open. They get so distracted trying to squeeze our hands or graze our backsides that they forget all about their luggage. It was easy work, really."
"Now hold on. Not every man is such a pathetic pushover."
"Ohoho! For the tough ones, we had another trick. In a crowded area, I’d let out a sharp scream. A huge crowd of onlookers would gather in seconds. Then, right there in front of everyone, I’d loudly accuse him of grabbing my hand, groping me, or trying to kiss me. The 'tough' ones are usually the most straight-laced, serious types. They can’t handle the public shame. Even if they're completely innocent, they're so desperate to avoid a scene that they'll press some cash into my hand just so they can slink away. That’s usually how it ends."
"I see... so you were into extortion as well. Tell me one last thing, and be blunt about it. Who are you people, really? How did you get so good at reading men?"
"Aha, so you’ve finally asked the big question, Mr. Emoto. My friends told me you would. Ohoho! I wouldn't even tell this secret to Hide-chan, the most handsome of the 'Three Birds of Minami,' but since it's you... I’ll confess. In exchange, let me have one of my Lucky Strikes."
She produced a lighter, flicking it with a practiced click.
"Ah, that’s the stuff. My biggest mistake was trying to play the part of a schoolgirl who doesn't even know how to smoke. My true identity? Well... don't be shocked. I’m a hostess from the Daishin-ro brothel in the Imazato district. To put it plainly, I’m a professional. O-Kiyo and O-Chizu are my colleagues from the same house."
"What?! A prostitute? Well, that explains why you're so good at handling men. But why on earth is a woman from the quarters out here moonlighting as a pickpocket?"
"Hehe... don't you get it? It’s the inflation. You just can't survive on a normal wage these days. Until last November, I spent two years selling my body at the Shofuku-ro in the Tobita district. It was a miserable, hellish existence. And unlike those 'Panpan' streetwalkers who just drag men into some flea-bitten hotel, we in the traditional quarters have high overheads—old-school formalities, codes of honor, room fees, expensive kimonos, and the cost of keeping ourselves fed and hydrated through the physical toll of the job. It takes an incredible amount of money. Even though I was the top earner in the house because of my looks and my talent, it was never enough. No matter how hard I worked..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Format & Layout:** The page is typical of post-war Japanese pulp magazines (*kasutori zasshi*). It uses vertical text (tategaki) arranged in columns that flow from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Ming-style typeface common in mid-century printing. Some kanji use older forms (kyūjitai) such as 變 (変), 眞 (真), and 賣 (売).
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing separates the text blocks, showing the interrogation or conversation in a Western-style cafe setting. The woman is dressed in a hat and coat, lighting a cigarette, while the man (the detective/interrogator) watches. This visual style evokes the *noir* or "hard-boiled" detective genre popular in that era.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The dialogue is broken into paragraphs with quotation marks to distinguish speakers. The page number "24" is centered at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Post-War Inflation:** The text explicitly mentions "inflation" (インフレ) making it impossible to survive. Post-WWII Japan suffered from hyperinflation, driving many into the black market or crime.
*   **Red-Light Districts:** Mention of **Imazato (今里)** and **Tobita (飛田)** refers to famous licensed/unlicensed prostitution districts in Osaka. This places the story's setting in the Kansai region.
*   **Panpan Girls (パンパンガール):** This was a derogatory term for streetwalkers who catered primarily to American GIs during the Occupation. The speaker distinguishes herself as a "higher class" traditional prostitute (Oiran/女郎) compared to the "cheap" streetwalkers.
*   **Lucky Strike:** An American cigarette brand. During the Occupation, Western cigarettes were highly prized luxury items often obtained via the black market.
*   **Ishibe Kinkichi (石部金吉):** A traditional idiom for an extremely upright, stubborn, or humorless person (composed of "stone" and "gold," suggesting hardness/rigidity).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **Suri (スリ):** Pickpocket.
*   **Chinpira (チンピラ):** Small-time hoodlum or punk.
*   **Yusuri (ゆすり):** Extortion/Blackmail.
*   **Gama-chan (甘ちゃん):** A naive person; a "softie."
*   **Kuroyama no yōna yajiuma (黒山のような野次馬):** A "mountain" (large crowd) of curious onlookers.
*   **Nan-kuse (難癖):** Finding fault or making a false accusation to cause trouble.
*   **Hōbai (朋輩):** Colleague or companion, often used among people in the same trade (common in the red-light districts).
*   **Oiran (オイラン):** Historically a high-ranking courtesan, used here somewhat loosely or nostalgically to refer to brothel workers.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Economic Desperation:** The central theme is the "hellish" economic reality of post-war Japan. Even the "top earners" in the sex trade resort to crime because of debt and high costs of living.
*   **Deception & Performance:** The women use their feminine wiles and various disguises (schoolgirls, office girls) to exploit the "weakness" of men. The text plays on the contrast between their "innocent" appearances and their "sinful" reality.
*   **The Fallen Woman:** A common trope in 1950s literature—the woman who is a victim of circumstances (the "hell" of the brothel) but uses her wits to survive in a predatory urban environment.
*   **Class Stigma:** There is a notable subtext of hierarchy within the sex industry, with the speaker looking down on streetwalkers while lamenting the "honor and codes" that keep her in debt.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction / Short Story (Hard-boiled / Crime)
*   **Genre:** Noir, Social Realism, Erotica-Grotesque-Nonsense (Ero-Guro-Nansensu)
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Prostitution, Pickpocketing, Inflation, Deception, Gender Roles, Urban Crime.
