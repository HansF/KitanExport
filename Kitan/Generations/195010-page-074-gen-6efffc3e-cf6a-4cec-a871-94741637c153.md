或る情死未遂者の告白
邪恋の果
三部 賤

一
嫂（ねよめ）は容貌は特に美しいといふのではありませぬでしたが均整がとれてむつちりと脂肪のついた白い肩や胸、ぷつくら盛り上つた腰や太股などは今でも私の情欲を唆（そそ）るには、余りにも刺戟が多過ぎるものでした。
嫂は二人兄弟の私の兄の嫁で、兄と結婚して半年も経たないうちに、兄を戦場へ送り、二年目に兄を中支の戦線で喪つたのでした。
つい最近、私が復員して来る迄、七ヶ年といふ長い間、味気ない砂を噛むような月日をよんどころない空虚さに甘んじながら、年老いた私の両親を見守って来たのです。
嫂は私が復員した時から何かと親切にして呉れましたし、私の世話をすることが何か楽しい様でもありました。
私もこの三十才前の未亡人の行末を案ずる気持で一杯でした。
だから、嫂の実家から――子供もないことだから――と引き取りに来た時も、
「まあ、いゝぢやありませんか、七年の間随分苦労されたんだから、嫂さんの気の向いた様にしてやりましょうよ。」
と双方の親達を納得させたものでした。その後で嫂の安心しきつた淋しい顔を見ると、それで満足していた私でありました。

そんな或る日の夕方、私に着物を着せかけていた彼女が、
「まあ、透（とおる）さん、あんた、とても主人に似てるわね、私、どうかしらた時思わず間違えることがあるのよ。」
と冗談ともつかず言った事もありました。

そんな時に限って、しみじみこんな境涯にある女の哀れさを感じるのでした。
そして一ヶ月は夢のように過ぎました。此の頃になると、戦争病でぷくぷく蒼腫れしていた私の身体もどうやら元通りになつてきましたし性来の商売気から、自家の田畑の少いのを理由に隣村の釜田炭坑の市場に店を出すことにしました。
品物は野菜や果物でしたが、品物が少なかつた頃だつただけに、私の思い切った身体の使い方が効を奏したのか、半年も経たぬうちに、もう幾らか余裕が出来て来ました。

それは蒸々する夜でした。私はいつもの様に店仕舞すると、その夜に限つて妙にアルコールが欲しくて、同じ市場のおでん屋で、したたかカストリを飲み、いゝ気持で家に帰つたのはもう八時を過ぎていました。
嫂は茶の間で一人で待っていました。が、私の帰るのを待ち構えていたように言いかけました。
「合田の伯父さんが急に悪いとかで、裏からお父さんもお母さんもお出かけになりましたが…」
「あゝ、さうですか、で嫂さん御飯まだでしょう」
もう八時過ぎだというのに、夕御飯も食べずにいる彼女が不憫で、伯父の安否も訊かず私は想わずそう問い返しました。
「はあ、でも、私はいいんですの」
やつれた首筋を見せて、はにかみ乍ら（ながら）うつむきました。そんな仕草の中に私は今迄にない思いにかられ、しいんと静まり返つた人里離れた百姓家の寂けさが、息づまるように迫つてきて彼女と二人で相対坐しているのさえ居たたまれない気持に襲われるのでした。

今迄じつとうつむいていた嫂が
「透さん、私、相談があるんだけど」
とぷっくらと肉の盛り上つた膝の上へのせていた両手をもみながら顔を上げたのです。
「はあ、何にか、私に出来ることなら」
「えゝ、実は私の事ですので、何にか私に出来る仕事はないものでしょうか、出来ることなら透さんの仕事、手伝わして戴けないかしら」
私は初め彼女の言うことが、何のことか分らず返事をするのもためらっていました。
「もう此れ以上、このまゝの状態では皆さんに迷惑をかけるばかりですからそれかと云つて……」
「それかと云つて、嫂さん、何にか」
私は咄嗟にそこ迄言いかけてハッとしました。丸顔の彼女の顔がサツと崩れたと思うとワッと泣き伏したからです。

或る情死未遂者の告白
――邪恋の果て――
三部 賤

一
義姉（あねよめ）は、容貌が特に美しいというわけではありませんでしたが、均整がとれてむっちりと脂肪のついた白い肩や胸、ぷっくりと盛り上がった腰や太ももなどは、今でも私の情欲をそそるには、あまりにも刺激が強すぎるものでした。
義姉は二人兄弟の私の兄の妻で、兄と結婚して半年も経たないうちに兄を戦場へ送り、二年目に兄を中支（中国中部）の戦線で亡くしたのでした。
つい最近、私が復員してくるまで、七年という長い間、味気ない砂を噛むような月日を、やむを得ない空虚さに甘んじながら、年老いた私の両親を見守ってきたのです。
義姉は私が復員した時から何かと親切にしてくれましたし、私の世話をすることが何か楽しいようでもありました。私も、この三十歳前の未亡人の行く末を案じる気持ちでいっぱいでした。
だから、義姉の実家から「子供もいないことだから」と引き取りに来た時も、
「まあ、いいじゃありませんか。七年の間ずいぶん苦労されたんだから、義姉さんの気の向いたようにしてやりましょうよ」
と双方の親たちを納得させたものでした。その後で、義姉の安心しきった寂しい顔を見ると、それで満足していた私でありました。

そんなある日の夕方、私に着物を着せかけていた彼女が、
「まあ、透（とおる）さん、あなた、とても主人に似ているわね。私、どうかした時、思わず間違えることがあるのよ」
と冗談ともつかず言ったこともありました。
そんな時に限って、しみじみとこんな境遇にある女の哀れさを感じるのでした。
そして一ヶ月は夢のように過ぎました。この頃になると、戦時中の病気でむくんでいた私の体もどうやら元通りになってきましたし、元来の商売っ気から、自分の家の田畑が少ないのを理由に、隣村の釜田炭鉱の市場に店を出すことにしました。
品物は野菜や果物でしたが、品不足の時期だっただけに、私の思い切った働きぶりが功を奏したのか、半年も経たないうちに、いくらか余裕が出てきました。

それは蒸し暑い夜でした。私はいつものように店仕舞いすると、その夜に限って妙にアルコールが欲しくて、同じ市場のおでん屋で、したたかにカストリ（粗悪な焼酎）を飲み、いい気分で家に帰ったのはもう八時を過ぎていました。
義姉は茶の間で一人で待っていました。そして、私の帰りを待ち構えていたように言いかけました。
「合田の伯父さんが急に具合が悪くなったとかで、裏（の勝手口）からお父さんもお母さんもお出かけになりましたが……」
「ああ、そうですか。で、義姉さん、ご飯はまだでしょう」
もう八時過ぎだというのに、夕食も食べずにいる彼女が不憫で、伯父の安否も聞かずに私は思わずそう問い返しました。
「ええ、でも、私はいいんですの」
やつれた首筋を見せて、はにかみながらうつむきました。そんな仕草の中に、私は今までにない思いに駆られ、しんと静まり返った人里離れた農家の静けさが、息苦しいほど迫ってきて、彼女と二人で向かい合って座っていることさえ、いられないような気持ちに襲われるのでした。

今までじっとうつむいていた義姉が、
「透さん、私、相談があるんだけど」
と、ぷっくりと肉の盛り上がった膝の上にのせていた両手をもみながら顔を上げたのです。
「はい、何でしょうか、私にできることなら」
「ええ、実は私のことなのですが、何か私にできる仕事はないものでしょうか。できることなら、透さんの仕事を手伝わせていただけないかしら」
私は最初、彼女の言うことがどういうことか分からず、返事をするのもためらっていました。
「もうこれ以上、このままの状態では皆さんに迷惑をかけるばかりですから。それかといって……」
「それかといって、義姉さん、何ですか？」
私はとっさにそこまで言いかけてハッとしました。丸顔の彼女の顔がさっと崩れたかと思うと、わっと泣き伏したからです。

**Confession of a Certain Love-Suicide Attempt Survivor**
**The End of Illicit Love**
**By Sanbe Shizu**

1
As for the sister-in-law, her features were not particularly beautiful, but they were well-balanced, and her plump, fat-clad white shoulders and chest, her softly swelling hips and thighs, even now, to incite my lust, the stimulation was far too much.
The sister-in-law was the wife of my brother, the elder of us two brothers; within less than half a year of marrying my brother, he was sent to the battlefield, and in the second year, my brother was lost on the Central China front.
Until very recently, when I returned from demobilization, for the long period of seven years, while resigning herself to an unavoidable emptiness like days of chewing tasteless sand, she watched over my aged parents.
The sister-in-law, from the time I was demobilized, did various kind things for me, and doing things for me seemed somehow enjoyable to her. I, too, was full of feelings of concern for the future of this not-yet-thirty-year-old widow.
Therefore, when people from the sister-in-law's parental home came to take her back—saying "since there are no children"—
"Well, isn't it fine [to stay]? Since she suffered so much for seven years, let's let the sister-in-law do as she pleases,"
I convinced both sets of parents. When I saw the sister-in-law's completely relieved yet lonely face after that, I was satisfied with that.

On the evening of such a day, she, who was helping me into my kimono,
"Well, Tohru-san, you look very much like my husband, don't you? At times, I unintentionally mistake you for him,"
she said, in a way that was neither quite a joke nor serious.
Only at such times, I keenly felt the sorrow of a woman in such circumstances.
And one month passed like a dream. By around this time, my body, which had been swollen and pale from war-related illness, somehow returned to normal, and due to my natural business spirit, using the smallness of my family's fields as a reason, I decided to open a shop in the market of the neighboring village's Kamada Coal Mine.
The goods were vegetables and fruit, but because it was a time when goods were scarce, perhaps my reckless way of using my body [working hard] bore fruit, and within less than half a year, a bit of surplus [money] had already come about.

It was a sweltering night. When I finished closing the shop as usual, on that night in particular, I strangely wanted alcohol; at an oden shop in the same market, I drank quite a bit of kasutori, and it was already past eight o'clock when I returned home in a good mood.
The sister-in-law was waiting alone in the living room. But, as if waiting for my return, she started to speak.
"Since the uncle in Goda suddenly became unwell, Father and Mother went out through the back..."
"Ah, I see. Then, Sister-in-law, you haven't eaten yet, have you?"
Though it was already past eight, she was there without eating dinner; I felt pity for her, and without asking about the uncle's safety, I unintentionally asked that back.
"Yes, but, I am fine."
Showing her worn neck, she looked down while feeling bashful. Amidst such gestures, I was seized by thoughts I hadn't had until now; the silence of the remote farmhouse, which had become completely quiet, pressed in as if to stifle me, and I was overcome by a feeling that even just sitting opposite her was unbearable.

The sister-in-law, who until then had been looking down steadily,
"Tohru-san, I have something to consult with you about,"
raised her face while rubbing both hands which were placed on her softly flesh-swelling knees.
"Yes, whatever it is, if it's something I can do."
"Yes, actually, it's about myself; isn't there some work I could do? If it's possible, I wonder if I could help with your work, Tohru-san."
At first, I didn't understand what she was saying and was hesitant to answer.
"Any more than this, in this state, I will only be a burden to everyone, but having said that..."
"Having said that, Sister-in-law, what?"
I suddenly got that far and was startled. Because, just as I thought her round face had suddenly crumbled, she burst into tears.

**Confessions of a Failed Double Suicide**
**The Price of Forbidden Passion**
**By Shizu Sanbe**

I
My sister-in-law was never what one would call a striking beauty, but her body was perfectly proportioned. Even now, the memory of her pale, supple shoulders and the lush curve of her hips and thighs is enough to stir a desire that is almost too much to bear.
She was the wife of my only brother. Less than six months after their wedding, he was shipped off to the front; two years later, he fell in the battlefields of Central China. 
For seven long, hollow years until my recent demobilization, she endured a life as dry as sand, selflessly caring for my aging parents. Upon my return, she showered me with kindness, appearing to find a quiet joy in looking after my needs. I, in turn, was deeply concerned for the future of this widow, still in her twenties.
When her own family came to take her back—arguing that since there were no children, she had no further obligation to us—I was the one who persuaded both families to let her stay. "She has suffered for seven years," I said. "Let us let her do as she wishes." Seeing the mixture of relief and lingering loneliness on her face afterward, I felt I had done the right thing.

One evening, as she was helping me into my kimono, she remarked—half-joking, half-serious—"You know, Tohru, you look so much like my husband. Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I find myself mistaking you for him."
It was moments like those that made the pathos of her situation truly sink in.
A month passed like a shifting dream. My body, once bloated and pale from wartime illness, finally regained its strength. Driven by a natural entrepreneurial spirit and knowing our small family farm couldn't sustain us, I opened a stall selling vegetables and fruit at the market near the Kamada Coal Mine in the next village. Since goods were so scarce in those days, my hard labor paid off. Within six months, I had begun to see a modest profit.

One sweltering night, after closing up shop, I found myself possessed by a sudden, sharp craving for a drink. I stopped at an oden stall in the market and put away a considerable amount of *kasutori* liquor. By the time I stumbled home in a pleasant daze, it was past eight o'clock.
My sister-in-law was waiting alone in the sitting room. She seemed to have been bracing herself for my return.
"Uncle Goda took a sudden turn for the worse," she said. "Your father and mother rushed out the back to see him."
"I see. And you, have you eaten yet?" 
I felt a pang of pity seeing her there, dinnerless at such a late hour. I had forgotten even to ask about my uncle.
"Oh, I'm quite alright," she replied, her voice trailing off as she looked down, exposing the delicate, weary line of her neck.
In that moment, a strange, new sensation gripped me. The heavy silence of our isolated farmhouse pressed in on us, thick and suffocating. The simple act of sitting across from her became an agony of tension.

She had been staring at her lap, her hands kneading her knees. Finally, she looked up.
"Tohru, there's something I need to ask you."
"Of course. If it's within my power."
"It's about my future. Is there no work I could do? I thought... perhaps I could help you with your business."
I hesitated, not quite catching the drift of her plea.
"I can't go on like this," she continued. "I'm only a burden to the family. And yet..."
"And yet, what?"
I stopped short. Her round, gentle face suddenly contorted with emotion, and she collapsed into a fit of sobbing.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography:** The text is set in traditional vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left. The title uses a stylized, bold brush-stroke font typical of mid-century "low-brow" or "confession" magazines.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and subtitle are the largest elements, followed by the author's name. The main body text is divided into three dense columns.
*   **Illustration:** A line-drawing illustration occupies the top center. It depicts a man (presumably the narrator, Tohru) and a woman (the sister-in-law). The man is dressed in a simple Western-style shirt, reflecting post-war fashion, while the woman wears a kimono. The woman's expression is one of distress or deep thought, setting a somber, melodramatic tone.
*   **Sectioning:** The story is numbered (beginning with "一"), suggesting it is either the first part of a serialized story or the first chapter of a multi-part confession.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "(74)" is visible at the bottom center.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The "Kasutori" Era (1945–1952):** The term *kasutori* refers to a cheap, poor-quality dregs shochu popular in the desperate years following WWII. It lent its name to a genre of "pulp" magazines that were cheap, printed on poor paper, and usually folded after three issues (just as one was said to pass out after three cups of *kasutori*). These magazines specialized in "confessions," erotica, and sensationalist tales.
*   **Repatriation and War Loss:** The narrator is a "repatriate" (*fukuin-sha*), a soldier returning to a devastated Japan. The brother’s death in "Central China" (*Chū-shi*) refers to the Second Sino-Japanese War.
*   **Widowhood and Family Structure:** In the *Ie* (patriarchal family) system of the time, a widow often stayed with her husband's family to care for her in-laws, especially if she had no children or nowhere else to go. The suggestion that she might return to her birth family was a common social crossroads for war widows.
*   **The Taboo of the Sister-in-law:** A romantic or sexual relationship between a man and his brother's widow was a common trope in *Kasutori* literature, playing on themes of "forbidden" love (*jaren*) and the physical proximity mandated by shared housing in impoverished post-war conditions.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **情死 (Jōshi):** A double suicide committed by lovers. The title suggests the narrator survived such an attempt.
*   **邪恋 (Jaren):** Literally "evil love" or "illicit love." It refers to a relationship that violates social or moral norms.
*   **嫂 (Neyome/Aneyome):** An older brother's wife. The furigana in the text unusually uses *neyome*, though *aneyome* or *ani-yome* is more standard.
*   **未亡人 (Mibōjin):** Widow. Literally "one who has not yet died," reflecting the traditional expectation that a wife's life was tied to her husband's.
*   **カストリ (Kasutori):** Mentioned earlier; a symbol of the post-war "bottom-feeder" lifestyle and the escape found in cheap intoxication.
*   **中支 (Chū-shi):** Central China. A common theater of war for Japanese soldiers in the 1930s-40s.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eroticism and the Male Gaze:** The narrative begins with a detailed, highly sexualized description of the sister-in-law's body, establishing the "pulp" nature of the text.
*   **Post-War Nihilism:** The description of the seven years as "chewing tasteless sand" reflects the widespread sense of exhaustion and meaninglessness felt in the immediate post-war period.
*   **Economic Desperation vs. Sexual Tension:** The plot moves from the narrator's struggle to survive and profit in the market to the domestic tension of two adults left alone in a house. The economic "success" of the narrator creates a power dynamic where the widow must beg for a role in his business to justify her existence in the house.
*   **Transgression:** The woman's comment about the narrator looking like his brother serves as a psychological "green light" for the taboo relationship to follow, blurring the lines between familial duty and sexual desire.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Confession-style Novella / *Kokuhaku-mono*)
*   **Genre:** Pulp fiction, Melodrama, Erotica (*Abunai* literature)
*   **Tags:** Post-war Japan, Forbidden love, Widowhood, War trauma, Kasutori culture, Family drama, Poverty, Masculinity.
