**From Among the Achievement Tales of Akizora Akiko**
**The Angel's Crime**
**Sugiyama Kiyoshi**
**Art by Nagatsuma Reiko**

...A...
Nurses are strong-willed or such, people often say, but is it true?
By around this time, it has likely disappeared, but if compared with the race of people known as "sheltered young ladies," indeed the spirit is strong, and even the "second heart" is likely healthy. However, having a face like one wouldn't even kill a bug, yet grandly holding qualifications as a "ban-ban," or appearing refined on the surface like a socialite "Yamanote lady," their unknown hidden skills appearing much more strong-willed, is it just my... professional jealousy—?
When I finished girls' school, because my house was not very wealthy, somehow, wanting to manage an independent livelihood myself in the future and make my parents feel a little at ease, I staged a "rebellion" just like a man, and with the feeling of wanting to return even a little of the parents' kindness who went as far as reducing their three meals to put me through girls' school, I took the nurse's examination.
Furthermore, becoming a public health nurse and also taking a midwife's license was what I was thinking. That was because my household was just mother alone and me alone, a lonely life. In other words, the notion that I must become the main pillar of the household finances in the future was deeply rooted.
I, having graduated from the Kyoto Prefectural Medical University nurse training center and passed the apprenticeship period, was employed at Ogura Surgical Hospital. That was the first step of that cursed fate.
When I was at the medical university, I often observed dissections and major surgeries, and my spirit became quite strong, and I shouldn't have been the type to lose consciousness and faint no matter what sight I was shown, but when it comes to a surgical hospital, patients whose heads are split yet are somehow still alive, or patients hit by trains whose limbs are hanging on by just skin, or patients with intestines hanging out and spraying a surprising amount of blood from a cut-open abdominal cavity—when such extremely gruesome, severely injured patients were carried in one after another, as expected, the fact that humans are living became very frightening and I sometimes had dreams.
Eventually, I was to discover that gruesome mysterious corpse and receive a sentence of death, but at that time, even the voices of severely injured patients moaning at midnight felt frightening, like wailing from hell.
Ogura Hospital was very busy as Dr. Ryuzaburo was a giant among surgeons. In Sakai Sanpo Coast of Osaka Prefecture, there was also a psychiatric branch. At the main hospital in Kyoto, the Doctor, his eldest son Ikuo-san, and second son Ikujiro-san were in charge as attending physicians, and the third son...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**From the Case Files of Akiko Akizora**
**The Angel’s Crime**
**By Kiyoshi Sugiyama**
**Illustration by Reiko Nagatsuma**

People often say that nurses are a tough-minded lot, but I wonder if that’s really true. While the old-fashioned "delicate hothouse flower" types have mostly vanished by now, a nurse certainly has a stronger constitution and a sturdier heart by comparison. Yet, when I see those refined ladies of the Yamanote district—women who look as though they wouldn't hurt a fly and act like sophisticated socialites, yet possess hidden, steely depths—I find them far more formidable. Or perhaps that’s just my own professional bitterness speaking?

After I finished girls' high school, since my family wasn't well-off, I staged a "rebellion" of sorts, acting more like a son than a daughter. I wanted to earn my own living and put my mother's mind at ease. My parents had sacrificed so much, even cutting back on their own meals to afford my education, and I felt a desperate need to repay that debt. So, I sat for the nursing exams.

I planned to go even further—to become a public health nurse and a licensed midwife. You see, it was just my mother and me; we lived a quiet, lonely life. I was driven by the deep-seated conviction that I had to become the sole breadwinner for our household.

After completing my training at the Kyoto Prefectural Medical University’s nursing school and finishing my residency, I found work at the Ogura Surgical Hospital. Little did I know, that was my first step toward a cursed destiny. 

During my university days, I had watched dissections and major operations. I thought I had grown thick-skinned enough that no sight could make me faint. But at a dedicated surgical hospital, the reality was different. Patients brought in with split skulls yet still clinging to life; victims of train accidents with limbs dangling by mere shreds of skin; bodies with abdomens torn open, intestines exposed, gushing horrifying amounts of blood. Seeing such carnage day after day made the very fact of human life seem terrifying. I began to have nightmares.

The time would come when I would discover a truly gruesome corpse and find myself sentenced to death. But back then, even the midnight moans of the critically ill sounded to me like the wailing of souls in hell.

The Ogura Hospital was a thriving practice, headed by Dr. Ryuzaburo, a titan in the field of surgery. They even had a psychiatric branch out on the Sanpo coast in Sakai, Osaka. At the main hospital in Kyoto, the staff was led by the Doctor himself, along with his eldest son, Ikuo, and his second son, Ikujiro. The third son...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows the standard "Three-Column" vertical format common in mid-century Japanese "Bungei" (literary) or "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines.
*   **Typography:** The title is rendered in a stylized, bold, hand-drawn font that evokes a sense of mystery or "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) intrigue.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "Angel's Crime" is the largest element, followed by the series title and author names. The illustration at the top serves to draw the reader in, depicting a woman (likely the protagonist Akiko) looking distressed, with a car and a heart/needle motif—visual shorthand for a medical mystery involving a vehicular accident.
*   **Illustrations:** The art by Nagatsuma Reiko is typical of the *shojo* or *fujin* (women's) magazine style of the era—expressive, slightly melodramatic, with thin, elegant lines.
*   **Pagination:** The number (98) at the bottom suggests this is a serialized story or part of a larger anthology.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** This text is written in the "Transition Orthography" of the late 1940s to early 1950s. It uses some historical kana (like *deseu* for *deshou*) and *kyujitai* (older kanji forms like 曉 instead of 暁), which were phased out after the 1946 reforms but lingered in popular magazines for years.
*   **"Yamanote" Ladies:** The text mentions *Yamanote reijo*. The Yamanote area of Tokyo was (and is) associated with the upper-middle class and old aristocracy. The narrator's comparison highlights the class divide between a working nurse and pampered socialites.
*   **Post-War Women's Roles:** The narrator speaks of wanting to be the "breadwinner" (*daikokubashira*) and having a "rebellion like a man." In the immediate post-war era, many women were forced into the workforce due to the loss of male relatives, leading to a shift in gender dynamics and the professionalization of nursing and midwifery.
*   **The "Second Heart":** This is an idiomatic way of referring to a person's grit, stamina, or perhaps a physiological robustness expected of medical professionals.
*   **Kyoto Prefectural Medical University:** A real, prestigious institution, lending a sense of "true crime" realism to the fiction.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **手柄話 (Tegarabana-shi):** A tale of achievement or a "success story." In detective fiction, it often refers to a "case file."
*   **深窓の令嬢 (Shinso no reijo):** Literally "a young lady of the inner windows." An idiom for a sheltered, upper-class girl.
*   **ムホン (Muhon):** Usually written as 謀反 (rebellion/treason). Here it is used metaphorically for a girl deciding to pursue a career instead of a traditional marriage.
*   **泰斗 (Taito):** An authority or a "shining star" in a specific field.
*   **慟哭 (Dokoku):** Wailing or lamentation. A high-register, dramatic word common in pulp mysteries.
*   **バンバン (Ban-ban):** Likely a period-specific slang or a reference to a "modern girl" (Moga) archetype or perhaps a specific qualification (though less clear in modern context, it implies a bold, capable persona).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Class Resentment:** There is a clear undercurrent of bitterness from the narrator toward the wealthy. She views her hard work as a "rebellion" against her poverty.
*   **The Horror of the Body:** The graphic descriptions of surgical patients serve the "grotesque" element of the *ero-guro-nansensu* tradition. The hospital is depicted not just as a place of healing, but as a "hell" of biological fragility.
*   **Foreshadowing/Suspense:** The narrator explicitly mentions she will be "sentenced to death." This is a classic "hook" in *confessional-style* detective fiction, where the narrator tells her story from a prison cell or as a retrospective.
*   **Independence vs. Duty:** The conflict between personal ambition and the traditional duty to support one's parents (filial piety) is a central driving force for the character.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Mystery, Serialized Novel.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Medical Drama, Crime, Post-war Japan, Female Independence, Class Conflict, Erotic-Grotesque (Ero-Guro).
*   **Setting:** Kyoto, Surgical Hospital.
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person feminine (*Atashi*).
