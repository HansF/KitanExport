四條河原町を北へ少し入つて、東へ曲ると、その横丁にささやかなバアが一軒ポツンとある。
　勿論七・一禁令の影響をうけて、表には休裁の休業札がかかつているがともあれ、あくどい花の名前のバア式の家たから、誰でも調べようと思えば直ぐわかる。
　このバアは、有名な喜劇の王と云われている一座の女形、蝶八が經營しているものである。とう書き出せば賢明な讀者は、そこが隠れた男色（ソドミー）の組合の一角であることにお気付きの事と思う。
　醜怪なサバト（男色嗜好疾患考）の酒宴が、今の世の中にも夜毎開かれていると言つても、一寸信じられないかも知れないが、現實の前には如何とも仕方がない。
　一歩裏口から店内に身を入れると其処は、晝も夜も、青い電燈がボウと翳いている狭い部屋である。
　壁には、涅槃夜宴の怪しげな繪が敷點かけられてある。それに混つて白蓮女史の短冊が一個見受けられるのは、どうした意味だろうか？
　常連は、画家、童話作家、華族くずれ、役者、音楽家、そう云う連中が多い、變に皆んな蒼白い顔をした人間ばかりだ。
「まあ、お久しぶり、どうなさつたとゆうの？、すつかりお見限りで、心配していたわ…」
　昨年の暮であつた、友人と新京極で会つた私は、二人でそのバアを久方振りで訪れた。
　主人の女形、蝶八がのつぺりとした白い顔に愛想笑いを浮べて言う。
　舞台で見る女形と言う顔を想像すると、現實の女形と稱する人間は、揃いも揃つて、まずい顔の人間ばかりである。蝶八も又その例に洩れな、い男なのである。
「旅行さ…」
「まあ、御旅行、羨ましいわ、どちらへお行きになつたの？」
　彼の冗舌には、いつもうんざりしている私は、あまり相手にならずウイスキーを飲み始めた。
　ボンヤリと青い光線のさす薄暗い部屋を見廻すと、相變らず、いつもの顔が見える。少女雑誌の表紙を描いている挿繪画家のＫ、音楽家のＫ、レヴュー作家のＹ、それらは皆サバトの連中だ。

**The Pot of Do-Re-Mi**
**By Toshiyasu Hiratatsu**
**Illustrated by Minami Niyō**

Enter a little north from Shijo Kawaramachi, turn east, and in that alley, one modest bar stands alone. Of course, receiving the influence of the 7.1 Prohibition [Ordinance], on the front, a "closed for business" sign is hung, but anyway, because it is a bar-style house with a gaudy flower name, anyone who thinks to look it up will know immediately. This bar is something managed by Chohachi, an *onnagata* (male actor of female roles) of a troupe said to be the King of Comedy. If I write starting like this, wise readers will, I think, notice that it is a corner of a hidden sodomy association. Even if one says that a hideous "Sabbath" (A Study of Sodomy Preference Disease) banquet is held every night in today's world, it might be a bit hard to believe, but before reality, there is nothing to be done.

Stepping into the shop from the back door, there is a narrow room where a blue electric light glows dimly day and night. On the walls, several suspicious paintings of a Nirvana Night Banquet are hung. Mixed among them, one *tanzaku* (poem card) by Lady Byakuren can be seen; I wonder what that means? Regulars are painters, fairy tale writers, fallen aristocrats, actors, musicians—many such people. Strangely, they are all people with pale faces.

"Oh, it's been a long time, what happened to you? You've completely neglected us, I was worried..."
It was the end of last year. I, who met a friend in Shinkyogoku, visited that bar after a long time with the two of us. The owner, Chohachi the *onnagata*, says with a fawning smile on his flat white face. When one imagines the face called "*onnagata*" seen on stage, the humans who call themselves "real-life *onnagata*" are, without exception, all people with ugly faces. Chohachi is also a man who is no exception to that.

"A trip..."
"Oh, a trip, I'm envious, where did you go?"
I, who am always fed up with his talkativeness, did not much engage him and started drinking whiskey. Looking around the dim room where a faint blue light ray shines, as usual, I see the usual faces. Illustrating painter K who draws covers for girls' magazines, musician K, revue writer Y—they are all the Sabbath crowd. Everyone is licking whiskey with heavy, muddy eyes.

There, poet T entered, bringing a cute beautiful boy like the Fukusuke Tabi mark. They went straight up to the second floor quietly. But everyone feigns ignorance, as if that were the etiquette of the Sabbath. Two or three waitresses are vigorously gulping down the guests' whiskey. From their sloppily opened chests, pale skin covered in white cream peeks out. Painter K catches one waitress and tries to kiss her forcibly.
"It's fine, isn't it, even if you let me kiss you."
"Stop it, the Rain-Scale's Chiko-san will cry!"
The waitress, who knows everything, pushed back "Count K" with a rough gesture.
"Hyaaa!" The musician claps his hands. The revue writer's lewd rhythm song of unknown meaning. Suddenly looking at my friend, he is talking intently with the owner Chohachi. Thick tobacco smoke, sour-sweet stagnant air. Chohachi's greasy long face is creepy like some sort of creature. His eyes are needlessly bloodshot, and only his hands placed on the table show a slender, supple whiteness.

**The Cauldron of Do-Re-Mi**
**By Toshiyasu Hiratatsu**
**Illustrated by Minami Niyō**

If you walk a short distance north from Shijo Kawaramachi and turn east into an alleyway, you’ll find a modest little bar standing all by itself. Nominally shuttered due to the July 1st Morality Ordinance, it sports a "Closed" sign out front, but given its garish floral name and bar-style facade, anyone looking for it would recognize it instantly. This establishment is run by Chohachi, an *onnagata*—a male actor of female roles—from a troupe dubbed the "Kings of Comedy." By opening this way, I trust my more perceptive readers will realize that this is a clandestine hub for a certain "sodomy circle." It might seem incredible to suggest that such grotesque "Sabbaths"—if I may call these gatherings of those with "sodomitic tendencies"—occur nightly in this modern age, but one cannot argue with the reality of it.

Slipping through the back door, you enter a cramped room where a blue lightbulb casts a ghostly, flickering glow regardless of the hour. On the walls hang several unsettling paintings depicting a "Nirvana Banquet." Curiously, a single poem card by the poetess Lady Byakuren is tucked among them—heaven knows why. The regulars are a motley crew of painters, children’s book authors, disgraced aristocrats, actors, and musicians. To a man, they possess strangely pallid complexions.

"Oh my, it’s been ages! Where have you been hiding? You’ve completely ignored us—I was so worried!"
It was late last year. Having met a friend in Shinkyogoku, the two of us decided to visit the bar for the first time in a long while. The proprietor, Chohachi, greeted us with a sycophantic smile plastered across his flat, white-painted face. While one might imagine the ethereal beauty of a stage *onnagata*, those who claim the title in the flesh are, almost without exception, quite homely. Chohachi was certainly no outlier.

"I was traveling," I replied.
"A trip? Oh, how lovely! I’m so jealous. Where did you go?"
Fed up with his incessant chatter as usual, I paid him little mind and set to my whiskey. As I surveyed the dim room, bathed in that hazy blue light, I saw the usual suspects. There was K, the illustrator known for his girls' magazine covers; K, the musician; and Y, the revue writer. They were the "Sabbath" regulars. Every one of them sat there, nursing their whiskey with heavy, glazed eyes.

Just then, the poet T arrived, accompanied by a beautiful young boy who looked like the mascot on a package of Fukusuke socks. They slipped quietly upstairs. Everyone pointedly looked the other way, as if feigning ignorance were the established etiquette of this "Sabbath." A few waitresses were busy knocking back the customers' whiskey. Through their disheveled, open collars, one could glimpse pale skin caked in thick white makeup. K, the painter, grabbed one of the girls and tried to force a kiss on her.
"Come on, what’s the harm in a little kiss?" he slurred.
"Cut it out! You'll make Chiko-san cry!" the waitress shot back. Hardened by years of seeing it all, she shoved "Count K" away with a rough hand.

"Hyaaa!" cackled the musician, clapping his hands. The revue writer began crooning a bawdy, nonsensical tune. I glanced at my friend and saw him deep in conversation with Chohachi. The air was thick with tobacco smoke and a sour, stagnant stench. Chohachi’s greasy, elongated face looked monstrous and repulsive. His eyes were shot through with blood, and yet his hands, resting on the table, were startlingly slender and supple in their whiteness.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** This is a single-page feature from a literary or "low-brow" culture magazine (*kasutori* or similar genre). It uses a standard three-column vertical text layout typical of Japanese periodicals.
*   **Typography:** The title "ドレミの壺" is presented in a large, stylized sans-serif font enclosed in a decorative border. The author and illustrator names are centered below the title.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration at the bottom left is the focal point, providing a visual shorthand for the "decadent" atmosphere described in the text. The text flows around the image, which depicts several characters mentioned (the musician, the illustrator, and the waitresses).
*   **Graphic Design:** The illustration is a line drawing with loose, expressive strokes, capturing a "bohemian" or "modernist" aesthetic popular in the mid-20th century.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Japan):** The mention of "Shijo Kawaramachi" and "Shinkyogoku" places the setting in the heart of Kyoto's entertainment district. The "7.1 Prohibition" (七・一禁令) likely refers to the **July 1st Ordinance** of 1948 or 1949, which cracked down on "red-light" activities and unregulated bars during the Allied Occupation.
*   **Onnagata & Queer Subculture:** The text explicitly mentions *onnagata* (kabuki-style female impersonators) and the term "Sodomy" (ソドミー). During the early post-war period, certain bars in Kyoto and Tokyo became safe havens for "homosexual societies" (男色組合). The author uses somewhat clinical or judgmental language ("disease," "hideous"), which reflects the era's social stigma, even while being part of the scene.
*   **Fukusuke Tabi:** The "Fukusuke" mark refers to a famous brand of traditional socks (*tabi*) whose logo features a large-headed, boyish figure. Comparing a "beautiful boy" to this mascot suggests a specific type of round-faced, youthful cuteness.
*   **Lady Byakuren (白蓮女史):** This refers to Yanagiwara Byakuren, a famous poetess known for her scandalous love life and high-society background. Her poem being in a gay bar adds a touch of "high-culture decadence" to the setting.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Sabbato (サバト):** Usually means "Sabbath," but here used by the author to describe a decadent, late-night gathering of social outcasts or "degenerates."
*   **Nirvana Night Banquet (涅槃夜宴):** A likely reference to "Nehan-zu" (paintings of Buddha's death), but "Night Banquet" implies a parody or a dark, hedonistic version of religious art.
*   **Kazoku-kuzure (華族くずれ):** Literally "crumbled aristocrat." Refers to former nobles who lost their status and wealth after the peerage system was abolished in 1947, often becoming bohemians or barflies.
*   **Amatenbin (雨天秤):** This is a specific slang term or a proper name/pun within that specific subculture, possibly referring to a specific person or a "fickle" nature.
*   **Chiko-san (稚子さん):** *Chiko* can mean "young child" or "acolyte." In this context, it is likely a nickname for a younger male partner or a specific regular at the bar.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Escapism vs. Reality:** The contrast between the "blue light" of the bar and the "reality" outside. The bar acts as an underworld where social norms are suspended.
*   **The Grotesque & The Beautiful:** The author finds the *onnagata* owner repulsive ("greasy," "creature-like") but notes the "supple whiteness" of his hands. This duality of attraction and repulsion is a hallmark of decadent literature.
*   **Post-War Malaise:** The "pale faces," "muddy eyes," and "stagnant air" capture the exhaustion and nihilism of the early post-war years (the "Dazai Osamu" era).
*   **Clandestine Identity:** The use of initials (K, T, Y) suggests these are real people known in the Kyoto arts scene, protecting their identities while hinting at a "secret society" of elite gay men and artists.
