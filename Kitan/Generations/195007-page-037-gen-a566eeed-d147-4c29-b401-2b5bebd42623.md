**商売の真相**
色と金の渦まく大阪裏街

一、米國式イージー・ペイメントとは？

大阪心齋橋筋Dデパートの筋向いに、Rと云うミシン会社の出張所がある。なか〻スマートな店構えで、ピカ〜光つたミシンが店内一杯に並んで居て、ミシンの欲しい主婦や娘さんの羨望の眼を集めている。

ところが一台の定價は一万二千円。金の唸る新興ブルジョアなら、もつと金を出して、シンガーあたりの一流品を求めるだろうが、一万二千円と云えば、普通の勤め人の一ヶ月分の全收入で、とても容易に買える値段ではない。私の妻もかねてから是非ミシンが一台欲しいと私に懇願しているのだが、私はいつもこの出張所の前を指をくわえて素通りするのが常であつた。

ところが先日、この店の前を通ると、大きな飾窓一杯にポスターが貼つてあり、黒山のような人だかりである。何だろうと人波を掻きわけて近づいてみると、

「米國式イージー・ペイメント販賣！一ヶ月僅か五百円で一万二千円のRミシンが入手できます。特賞三十万円つき大賣出し中」

と書いてある。
イージー・ペイメントを譯せば「安易な支拂法」で、つまり月賦販賣のことである。月五百円ぐらいなら貧乏世帯の私にもなんとかやりくりはつく。

私はさつそく喜び勇んで店内へ入り、汗だくで應接している店員をつかまえると、申込書を一枚もらった。五百円拂いこめば、明日から、ピカピカ光るミシンがわが家にそなえられると、私は希望に充ちて家へ帰ると、さつそく夕飯の卓で妻と相談した。
妻は不審そうな顔で
「だって現金拂いで一万二千円のミシンが毎月五百円の二十四回拂いと云うのは妙だわ、月賦にしたら金利や何かで、掛金はもつと高くなるはずよ、でなければ、支拂いの回数がもつと多くなるはずよ」
と云うのである。私もハツと氣ずいて
「それはそうだね、金利なしに、おまけに特賞三十万円出すとしたら、…このミシンの原價はべらぼうに安い粗悪品だね、もう一度その申込書をよく讀んでみようか」
と、規定をよく讀んでみるとガッカリした。

月五百円拂込二ヶ年（二十四ヶ月）満期にはちがいないが、かんじんの品物を渡すのは全部拂い込んだ後だと書いてあった。
「なんだ、それなら、他人の金を二ヶ年間無利子で自由に使うのが魂膽じゃないか、馬鹿にしていやがる！」とのどろの金ずまりで經營の運轉資金にこまつたあげく、ミシンを餌さの金集めさ。一人五百円で千人ならころりと一ヶ月五十万円、毎月々々五十万円入つてきて、品物は預かり、……なるほど、こんなボロ儲けはないねえ」
「こんなインチキにかゝらないようにやつぱり毎月自分で貯金して、二年ほど我慢したら、利子もついて一万五千円ぐらいにはなるわよ、それでいいミシンを自由に現金に買いましょうよ、きつともつと値段も安くなってますわ」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Tsuda Mikio
**The Truth of Business**
The Osaka backstreets where lust and money swirl.

1. What is the American-style Easy Payment?

Opposite D Department Store in Osaka Shinsaibashi-suji, there is a branch office of a sewing machine company called R. With quite a smart storefront, shiny glittering sewing machines are lined up filling the shop, gathering the envious eyes of housewives and young daughters who want a sewing machine.

However, the fixed price of one machine is 12,000 yen. If one were a "money-groaning" newly-emerged bourgeois, they would put out more money and seek a first-class product like a Singer, but speaking of 12,000 yen, it is the total income of one month for an ordinary worker, and not a price easily bought. My wife also has been pleading with me for a long time that she definitely wants one sewing machine, but I always made it a habit to pass by the front of this branch office while "sucking my finger" (watching helplessly).

However, the other day, passing the front of this shop, a poster was stuck all over the large display window, and there was a mountain-like crowd of people. Wondering what it was, I pushed through the wave of people and approached...

"American-style Easy Payment Sales! For only 500 yen a month, a 12,000 yen R sewing machine can be obtained. Now in a big sale with a grand prize of 300,000 yen."

...it was written.
If translating Easy Payment, it is "easy payment method," in other words, installment sales. If it is about 500 yen a month, even for my poor household, I can somehow manage.

I immediately entered the shop in high spirits, caught a clerk who was receiving customers while dripping with sweat, and received one application form. Thinking that if I paid in 500 yen, from tomorrow, a shiny glittering sewing machine would be installed in my home, I returned home full of hope and immediately consulted my wife at the dinner table.
My wife, with a suspicious face, said:
"But, 12,000 yen for a sewing machine in cash vs. 500 yen every month for 24 payments is strange. If it's installments, because of interest and such, the installments should be higher, or else, the number of payments should be more."
So she said. I also realized with a start:
"That's true. If there's no interest and on top of that they give a 300,000 yen prize... the cost price of this machine must be absurdly cheap and poor quality. Shall we read that application form well once more?"
And, when I read the regulations well, I was disappointed.

It was indeed a 500 yen payment for two years (24 months) until maturity, but it was written that the essential item would be handed over *after* paying everything in full.
"What, if that's the case, their scheme is to freely use other people's money for two years interest-free! They're making a fool of us!" After being troubled for operating funds due to a "clogging of money in the throat" (cash flow issues), they use the sewing machine as bait for money collection. 500 yen per person for 1,000 people is 500,000 yen a month easily; every single month 500,000 yen comes in, and the goods are kept... I see, there's no easy profit like this."
"To not get caught in such a fake thing, as expected, if I save by myself every month and endure for about two years, with interest it will become about 15,000 yen. With that, let's buy a good sewing machine freely with cash. Surely the price will have become even cheaper by then."

**The Reality of the Racket**
*By Mikio Tsuda*
*Deep in the Back-Alleys of Osaka, Where Greed and Lust Collide*

**I. The Myth of the "American-Style Easy Payment Plan"**

Just across from the D Department Store on Shinsaibashi-suji in Osaka sits the showroom for "R Sewing Machines." It’s a sharp-looking joint, its windows packed with gleaming, chrome-finished machines that draw the longing gazes of every housewife and young woman who passes by.

But there’s a catch: the sticker price is 12,000 yen. A "nouveau riche" with money to burn might shell out even more for a top-of-the-line Singer, but for the average salaryman, 12,000 yen represents an entire month’s wages—hardly an impulse buy. My wife had been begging me for a machine for ages, but I’d always made a habit of walking past the shop with a sigh, looking on helplessly at what we couldn't afford.

That changed the other day. As I walked past the showroom, I saw a massive poster plastered across the display window and a crowd of people gathered like a swarm of ants. Intrigued, I fought my way through the throng to see what the fuss was about.

"AMERICAN-STYLE EASY PAYMENT PLAN!" the sign screamed. "Own a 12,000 yen R Sewing Machine for just 500 yen a month! Grand Prize Lottery of 300,000 yen now in progress!"

"Easy Payment," for those not in the know, is just a fancy way of saying installment buying. I figured that at 500 yen a month, even a strapped household like mine could make the numbers work.

Full of excitement, I ducked into the shop, cornered a salesman who was sweating through his shirt while juggling customers, and grabbed an application. I headed home, heart light with the hope that a brand-new, shiny sewing machine would be sitting in our parlor by tomorrow. I laid the plan out for my wife over dinner.

She looked at me, her eyes narrowing with suspicion.
"Wait a minute," she said. "If the cash price is 12,000 yen and the payments are only 500 yen for twenty-four months, something is wrong. Installment plans always charge interest. The payments should be higher, or the term should be longer."

It hit me like a bucket of cold water. "You’re right. And if they’re offering no interest plus a 300,000 yen prize... the machines must be dirt-cheap junk. Let's take another look at that fine print."

I pulled out the application and read the terms carefully. My heart sank.

It was indeed 500 yen a month for twenty-four months. But the kicker was right there in the regulations: the customer wouldn't actually receive the sewing machine until the *final* payment was made two years later.

"The bastards!" I spat. "It’s a scam to get a two-year, interest-free loan from the public! They must be desperate for operating capital and are using the machines as bait to fix their cash flow. Think about it: a thousand suckers paying 500 yen a month brings in half a million yen every single month. They get the cash, and they keep the inventory. It’s the ultimate racket!"

"We won't fall for that nonsense," my wife said firmly. "If we just save that 500 yen ourselves every month for two years, we’ll have 15,000 yen with interest. Then we can walk in anywhere and buy a high-quality machine with cash. By then, the prices will probably have dropped anyway."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page uses a classic Japanese magazine layout of the mid-Showa era. The title is set in a bold, hand-drawn-style Gothic/Mincho hybrid, giving it a sensationalist, "pulp" feel. The text is arranged in vertical columns, reading right to left.
*   **Visual Elements:** The dominant graphic is a stylized spiral or vortex swallowing 1000-yen notes. This serves as a literal representation of the subtitle: "The vortex of lust and money." The illustration style is reminiscent of noir or social-realist illustrations of the 1950s.
*   **Hierarchy:** The author's name (Tsuda Mikio) is placed at the top right, indicating he was likely a regular columnist or a known investigative journalist. The main title is the largest element, followed by the sub-header for the specific section ("I. What is the American-style Easy Payment?").
*   **Formatting:** Use of "nakaguro" (dots) for emphasis (e.g., なか〻) and brackets for quotes or slogans is standard for the era. The page number "-38-" at the bottom suggests this was part of a longer feature or a serial.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-war Japan, late 1940s–1950s):** The price of 12,000 yen for a sewing machine and a 300,000 yen prize suggests the late 40s or early 50s. This was a period of high inflation followed by stabilization (the Dodge Line). Sewing machines were the ultimate "luxury necessity" (one of the "Three Sacred Treasures" alongside the refrigerator and television slightly later) for Japanese households attempting to modernize and save money by making their own clothes.
*   **"American-style" (米国式):** In the post-war occupation period, "American-style" was a potent marketing term, symbolizing modernity, efficiency, and wealth. Scammers frequently used the term to lend a veneer of legitimacy to predatory practices.
*   **Hire Purchase / Installment Plans (月賦 - Geppu):** Credit was not widely available to the working class. The "Easy Payment" system (a direct loanword) was a new concept. In this story, the "scam" is a common one of the era: a "Tsumitate" (installment savings) disguised as a purchase plan. The consumer thinks they are buying on credit, but they are actually just lending the company money interest-free until the full price is reached.
*   **Shinsaibashi (心斎橋):** A famous high-end shopping district in Osaka. Setting the story here adds a sense of "urban realism" and suggests that even in fancy districts, scammers are lurking.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **新興ブルジョア (Shinkō Burujoa):** "Nouveau riche" or "New Bourgeoisie." Refers to those who profited from the black market or post-war reconstruction while the average salaryman struggled.
*   **指をくわえて (Yubi o kuwaete):** Literally "with a finger in one's mouth." An idiom meaning to watch something longingly or helplessly while being unable to participate.
*   **黒山のような人だかり (Kuroyama no yōna hitodakari):** "A crowd like a black mountain." A common idiom for a very dense, large group of people.
*   **ボロ儲け (Boro-mōke):** Making "easy money" or "obscene profits," often with the connotation of being unfair or exploitative.
*   **魂膽 (Kontan):** A secret plan, scheme, or ulterior motive. Usually has a negative nuance.
*   **喉の金詰まり (Nodo no kanezumari):** Literally "money stuck in the throat." A colorful way to describe a severe cash flow shortage or being "choked" for funds.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Consumer Skepticism:** The text reflects the growing pains of a burgeoning consumer culture where traditional "neighborhood trust" was being replaced by aggressive, anonymous corporate marketing.
*   **The "Wise Housewife" Archetype:** The husband is impulsive and easily swayed by "American" buzzwords, while the wife is the rational economic actor who does the math and spots the flaw. This reinforces a common trope in Japanese media of the era where the woman manages the household finances with a cool head.
*   **Anti-Corporatism/Populism:** The text warns the "little guy" (the salaryman) against the "big business" schemes that prey on the desires of the poor to look "smart" (modern).
*   **Economic Realities:** The dialogue at the end highlights the transition from a "save and then buy" (pre-war/traditional) mentality to the "buy now, pay later" (modern/American) mentality, ultimately arguing for the former as a defense against exploitation.
