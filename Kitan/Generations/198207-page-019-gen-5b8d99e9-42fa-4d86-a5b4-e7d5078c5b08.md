━━ Memoirs of my Friendships with the Wizard of Rope, Takashi Tsujimura: Part 5 ━━

**Dashing Headlong into SM Heaven** by Shigeru Kayama

(Top Photo) Naomi Tani at age nineteen, radiating an air of purity.

(Bottom Photo) Naomi Tani and the author at her retirement party.

Having handled the camera duties in the Tokyo area, I eventually struck out on my own, moving beyond the guidance of Takashi Tsujimura. I set off on a "warrior’s pilgrimage" to master the ways of SM. Being a man of action, I immediately embarked on a trip to Nagoya to keep a promise to reunite with Mariko Sakonma. Through Tsujimura’s visits to Tokyo, I also had the opportunity to meet the popular novelist Oniroku Dan. Furthermore, I developed a friendship with Naomi Tani, who would later be known as the "Queen of SM." 
SM, SM, SM! 
May there be much happiness in this frantic SM life!!

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is structured vertically, typical of Japanese periodicals. It utilizes a mix of large photographic elements and text blocks.
*   **Typography:** The main title "SM天国まっしぐら" uses a bold, heavy Gothic font to grab attention. The subtitle and captions use a standard Mincho (serif) font.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The primary focus is a large, high-contrast portrait of a young Naomi Tani. The title is placed vertically on the right, separated from the text by decorative borders.
*   **Imagery:** The large photo highlights the "purity" (*seijun*) mentioned in the caption, creating a deliberate contrast with the "SM" theme of the text. The smaller photo provides "proof" of the author's proximity to the star.
*   **Pagination:** A small "20" is visible at the bottom right, indicating the page number.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Naomi Tani (谷ナオミ):** A legendary figure in Japanese "Pink film" (erotic cinema) and SM subculture. She was famously dubbed the "Queen of SM" and was the muse of novelist Oniroku Dan.
*   **Oniroku Dan (団鬼六):** The most influential Japanese author of SM fiction. His work transitioned the genre from underground "fuzoku" (fetish) magazines into mainstream popularity in the 1960s and 70s.
*   **Takashi Tsujimura (辻村隆):** A renowned *shibari* (Japanese rope bondage) master. In this era, *shibari* was often treated as a traditional art form (*nawa-jutsu*) as much as a sexual fetish.
*   **Late 1960s/70s Context:** This was a period of "Erotic Grotesque Nonsense" revival and the booming "Pink Film" industry. The text reflects a time when the SM scene was a tight-knit community of photographers, writers, and performers.
*   **Musha Shugyō (武者修業):** Traditionally a samurai's quest to test his skills. Using this term for an "SM journey" is a playful, hyperbolic use of "macho" language for subcultural pursuits.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **まっしぐら (Masshigura):** Headlong; at full speed. Often used for "rushing toward a goal."
*   **縄の魔術師 (Nawa no Majutsushi):** "Wizard of Rope." A common honorific for master practitioners of bondage.
*   **カメハン (Kame-han):** Likely a contraction of *Kamera-han* (カメラ班 - camera crew/team) or *Kamera-handoraa* (カメラハンドラー - camera handler/assistant).
*   **一人歩き (Hitori-aruki):** Literally "walking alone," but idiomatically meaning to become independent or strike out on one's own professionally.
*   **清純 (Seijun):** Pure; innocent. This was a common trope in Japanese erotic media—the "pure" girl who is initiated into the world of SM.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Nostalgia and Lineage:** The author is establishing his "credentials" by listing the legends he has worked with (Tsujimura, Dan, Tani). It serves to validate his status within the subculture.
*   **The Contrast of Purity and Fetish:** By emphasizing Naomi Tani's "purity" at age 19, the text leans into the "corrupting" or "transformative" narrative common in SM media of that era.
*   **Brotherhood/Community:** The tone is upbeat and celebratory ("May there be much happiness!"), portraying the SM world not as a dark, shameful underground, but as an exciting, "heavenly," and busy social circle.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Memoir, Essay, Subculture History.
*   **Primary Tags:** SM (Sadomasochism), Naomi Tani, Oniroku Dan, Shibari, Japanese Cinema History, Showa Era.
*   **Tone:** Enthusiastic, Nostalgic, Biographical.
