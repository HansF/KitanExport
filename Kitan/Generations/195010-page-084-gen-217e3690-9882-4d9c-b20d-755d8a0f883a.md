**第一話：踊り子と乳当ての南京玉**
リベラル・ショーの踊り子——特に豊かな肉体美に、100パーセントのエロティシズムを放散する九分の一裸体の娘たちは、時々肩から吊っている乳当ての南京玉の糸を切断させる。
まさか、故意にやるわけではないだろうから、こういう機会に出くわした人は、二千円くらいの宝くじに当たった程度に喜んでもいい。
とにかく彼女の乳押さえの南京玉の糸は時々切れる。特に夏場は、一日に三回もの興行の時には、滝のように流れる汗のためにすっかり弱ってしまった糸は、彼女らの肉体の振動のたびに、実にはらはらするほどよられている。
そして突然ぷっつりといってしまう。円形の障害物がはらりと落ちる。見物ははっと息を呑む。豊満な乳房が気球のように揺れる。しかし彼女らは慣れたもので、落ち着いてその円板を再び胸の上に引き上げて、極めて優美なスタイルでそれを押さえ、ちゃんと幕まで踊り続ける。

**第二話：ズロースの破れに気がつかなかった踊り子**
ある盛り場の実演専門の劇場で、「裸の女王」と謳われた売れっ子の踊り子が来たことがあった。
その最初の挨拶に、「実は彼女は昨日まで地方を巡業して非常に疲れている上に、折も折、あいにく彼女は月の病（生理）の最中なので……」といったようなことを述べ立てたのである。
ただでさえ、鼻の下の長い連中のこと、そんなことを聞かされれば変な気分に陥るところへ、またその人が、うまく綺麗に喋ろうとしたため、かえって反対に、妙に悩ましい桃色の眼鏡をお客さんにかけてしまった。
お客さんの心臓はなんとなく、そわそわ、にやにやしている。姿を現した彼女の小さな身体は、頭のてっぺんから足の爪先まで、お客の射るような視線で舐め尽くされた。
いよいよ「アラベスク」の踊りが始まった。かぶりつきにいた連中が何気なしに彼女の方を見ると、——何だか変なのである。「おや？」と思ってその部分に一心に目を据えていると、やっぱり妙なのである。
そのうち、踊りは次第にクライマックスに達して、右足でつま先立ちし、左足を思い切り持ち上げて、一小節の間のポーズをする。
彼女は客席に向かって目一杯に肌を広げて、にっこりとしてポーズに移った。これまで半信半疑であったお客さんたちは、この時に至ってついに、アメリカ大陸を発見したコロンブスのように恍惚とした三昧境に入った。
見よ。彼女のズロースは猛烈に綻びていたのである。しかし踊っているご本人は夢中だから、全然そんなことには気がつかない。
それこそ大胆に悠々と、ポーズをとっていたのである。

Anyway, her breast-presser's Nankin-beads' thread-wa sometimes snaps. Especially summer-time-wa, one day-in three times' performances' time-at, waterfall-like flowing sweat because of completely weakened-ended thread-wa, their body's vibration every time, truly heart-pounding degree twisted-is.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Naked Dancers: Arabesque**
By Hajime Tomino

**Chapter 1: The Dancer and the Beaded Pasties**
The dancers of the "Liberal Show"—specifically those girls who radiate total eroticism in their nearly naked state—occasionally snap the threads of the beaded pasties hanging from their shoulders. Since it’s unlikely they do it on purpose, anyone lucky enough to witness such a moment might as well have won two thousand yen in the lottery.
At any rate, those threads holding their breast-covers often give way. In the heat of summer, through three shows a day, the threads become weakened by the literal waterfalls of sweat. With every vibration of the dancer's body, the beads twist precariously until—*snap!*—the little circular shields flutter to the floor. The audience catches its breath as her ample breasts bob like balloons. But the dancers are professionals; they calmly pull the disks back into place and, with practiced elegance, hold them there while they finish their routine.

**Chapter 2: The Dancer Who Didn't Notice Her Torn Drawers**
Once, a star dancer known as the "Queen of Nudity" came to a theater in the red-light district. In the opening introduction, it was announced that she was exhausted from a rural tour and, to make matters worse, it was currently "her time of the month." 
The audience members—already a bunch of lechers—found their imaginations running wild. The announcer’s attempt to frame the situation delicately only served to give the men a pair of "rose-colored glasses," heightening their anticipation. When she finally appeared, her petite frame was devoured by the piercing glares of the crowd, from the crown of her head to her tiptoes.
As her "Arabesque" number began, the men in the front row noticed something odd. They squinted, focusing intensely on one spot. Yes, something was definitely off. 
As the dance reached its climax, she rose onto her right toe, hoisted her left leg high, and struck a pose that lasted a full measure. Facing the audience, she bared herself completely with a radiant smile. At that moment, the skeptical crowd finally entered a state of pure, ecstatic bliss, like Columbus discovering the Americas. 
You see, her drawers were torn wide open. But the dancer, completely lost in her performance, hadn't noticed a thing. She remained there, posing boldly and grandly for all to see.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of modern and pre-war kanji and kana (e.g., 興行, 實, 氣, 綻び). The font is a standard serif used in mid-century printing.
*   **Layout:** Vertical orientation (*tategaki*). The page is split into columns with decorative borders separating the main stories.
*   **Illustration:** A hand-drawn sketch in the center depicts a dancer in a state of partial undress (holding a pastie) and a man in the audience watching with a lecherous expression. The style is reminiscent of early "erotic-grotesque" (ero-guro) manga.
*   **Structure:** Two distinct anecdotes (First Story, Second Story) followed by a sidebar. This "shohan" (short story) format was typical for entertainment magazines intended for quick reading.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Large, bold titles for the series and the specific chapters. The author's name is placed prominently at the top.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture (1945–1955):** The term *Kasutori* refers to a cheap, low-quality dregs-based shochu (alcohol) popular in the post-war era. Like the drink, these magazines were cheap, "intoxicating," and disappeared after three "cups" (issues). They often focused on sex, scandal, and pulp fiction.
*   **Liberal Shows (リベラル・ショオ):** A term used for striptease or variety shows in occupied Japan. After the war, censorship relaxed, leading to a boom in "naked theaters."
*   **Nankin-dama (南京玉):** Literally "Nanking beads," a term for glass beads. In this context, they are used as decorative pasties or covers for nipples.
*   **"Moon's Sickness" (月の病):** A period-specific euphemism for menstruation (*gekkei*). The mention of it in the second story is intended to add a "forbidden" or "naughty" allure to the performance.
*   **Currency Reference:** The mention of "2,000 yen in the lottery" suggests the late 1940s or early 1950s. At that time, 2,000 yen was roughly equivalent to half a month's salary for a starting civil servant.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Hana no shita ga nagai (鼻の下が長い):** Literally "long under the nose." An idiom meaning to be lecherous or easily seduced by women.
*   **Zuroosu (ズロオス):** From the English "drawers." In post-war Japan, this specifically referred to loose-fitting women's undergarments or bloomers.
*   **Sanmaikyo (三昧境):** A Buddhist term (*Samadhi*) meaning a state of intense concentration or spiritual absorption. Here, it is used humorously to describe the audience's rapt attention to the dancer's crotch.
*   **Kaburitsuki (かぶりつき):** The front-row seats at a theater, usually used in the context of strip shows where viewers want to be as close as possible.
*   **Nandaka (何んだか):** An archaic spelling of *nandaka* (somewhat/somehow).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and the Male Gaze:** The text explicitly caters to a male audience, focusing on the "lucky" moments when clothing fails or bodies are exposed.
*   **Post-War Liberation/Decadence:** The "Liberal Shows" and the casual discussion of nudity reflect the chaotic freedom of post-war Japan, where old morals were discarded.
*   **Humor and Misfortune:** The tone is lighthearted and comedic. The dancer's "wardrobe malfunction" is presented not as a tragedy, but as a comedic "gift" to the audience.
*   **Classicism vs. Vulgarity:** The sidebar features a parody or snippet of *Sei Shonagon* (author of *The Pillow Book*), juxtaposing high classical literature with the "low-brow" content of the striptease stories. This irony was a common trope in pulp magazines.
