**有閑マダム攻略戦**
**私はこうして、美しい未亡人を獲得した**
**早乙女　晃**

心。
包みを開いてみると、××様、つたと書いてある。女将の名である。顔はみているが、何の関りもない者から、何故こんなものを貰うんだろうと、品物の如何に拘らず、私は早速返却に行つた。
「まあ、かまいませんわ」
そういつて女将は、帰ろうとする私を無理に止め、てんやわんやで酒肴の用意をさせた。
「さあどうぞ、おあがりなさいな、おひとりなんでしょう？ いいぢやございませんか、お自分の家だと思つて、こんなお婆さんの傍で嫌でしょうけど気軽に、ごゆっくりして下さいな」
眞向からこの挨拶である。
私も幾分顔負けをした。いわれるままにちよつと一杯ご馳走になつた。
こうなると、まんざら知らぬ仲でもない。話に漸次味が出てくる。五杯が十杯、十杯が二十杯となつて、いささか私もご機嫌になつた。
随分念入りに化粧したらしく、女将の顔も三十ぐらいに若返り、ボーツと赫らめた顔をすり寄せてきて、手を握りにくる。
そんなことはゼン／＼知らぬ体に、私は酔いつぶれて、女将の膝を枕に寝込んでしまう。一年の空閨が、たまらなく女将の情念を刺激するのか、大つぴらに、私を愛撫する。

良太は童貞ではなかつた。
彼が童貞を失つたのは、戦争中学徒動員で第一線に送られた時、作戦命令の出る一週間前の慰安所であつた。始め女を知つたときはひどく煽情的であつた。
良太はその夜の官能的な女のポーズが、今でも眼底の何処かに残つているのか、時々、郷愁のようにチラチラ想出すことがあつたが、五年の歳月を経つた今では、淡い記憶の一片でしかなかつた。
良太が今日書店に現れたのは、その記憶を裏付る結婚の生態が極めたかつたからだ。彼は其処で、印度の性典「カーマスートラ」と、アメリカ青年男女の性生活を蒐録した。「キンゼイ報告書」の二冊を買い、省線の乗場で見流新聞の夕刊も買つた。
それには彼が水木京太のペンネームで投稿した「有閑マダム攻略戦」というお上品なエロチックなコントが載つていた。テーマは、有閑未亡人の離れを貸つた用心棒を兼ねた青年が、ふとした智略で、遂にマダムの肉体を征服するという、ユーモアたつぷりの一篇なのである。
ところが、皮肉か偶然か、良太が書いたコントの下の欄に、次のような貸間広告が載つていた。
◎貸間いたします、住所××××。但し年齢二十五歳より三十五歳迄の独身

やがて立上つて、布団を敷いてくれた。
夜となつた。
私はまだ寝ていた。客が騒いでいるのが遠い物音のように聞えている。今夜は大繁昌らしく、妓も十人あまりきているらしい。
時間は流れた。遊び客が帰つた後、嵐が過ぎたような静けさになつた。
その時まで、私は、女将の部屋に寝そべつていた。抱え奴も客を済ませて今夜は温順しく寝てしまう。
火鉢の前で煙管の音がする。女将はまだ起きて一ふく吸つているらしい。漸く眼を覚した私は、時間もかなり過ぎているので、大慌てに帰ろうと寝床から抜け出ると
「あなた、もう遅いから今夜は泊つてらつしやいな――」
女将は呼び止めて、また酒を進めた。根が厚かましく出きている私のことだ、
「困つたなあ」それを連発し、頭を掻き、する／＼とその夜は女将に出来る限りのサービスを提供して朝まで、一睡もしなかつた。
アレから三日間、のらりくらりと居続けをしている。それでも純情さを失わない態度を持しているので、すつかり信用してしまつた女将は、もう公然と若い燕から、亭主に引き上げようと焦つている。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Idle Madam Conquest War**
**I, in this way, a beautiful widow acquired.**
**Saotome Akira**

[Heart.]
When opening the package, "Mr. XX, from Tsuta" was written. It is the name of the proprietress. Faces I have seen, but from someone with no connection, why would I receive such a thing? regardless of the goods' nature, I immediately to return it went.
"Oh, it does not matter."
Saying so, the proprietress, me who was trying to return, forcibly stopped, and in a hubbub, prepared sake and snacks.
"Now, please, come up. You are alone, aren't you? Isn't it fine? Think of it as your own home. Being beside such an old woman might be unpleasant, but feel at ease, please take your time."
Head-on, this greeting was.
I also somewhat was outdone. As told, just one cup I was treated to.
When it becomes like this, it is not an entirely unknown relationship. In the talk, gradually flavor comes out. Five cups became ten, ten became twenty, and somewhat I became in a good mood.
Having applied makeup quite elaborately it seems, the proprietress's face also to about thirty rejuvenated, with a dazed, flushed face she sidled up, and comes to grip my hand.
To such a thing, as if entirely not knowing, I drank myself into a stupor, and using the proprietress's lap as a pillow, fell asleep. One year of a vacant bedroom, unbearably stimulating the proprietress's passions perhaps, openly, she caresses me.

Ryota was not a virgin.
He lost his virginity during the war, when sent to the front lines by student mobilization, at a comfort station one week before the tactical order was issued. When first he knew a woman, it was extremely suggestive.
Ryota, that night's sensual woman's pose, even now somewhere in the bottom of his eyes remains perhaps, sometimes, like nostalgia, flickeringly remembered, but now that five years of time have passed, it was nothing but a fragment of a faint memory.
The reason Ryota appeared at the bookstore today was that he wanted to master the ecology of marriage that backs up those memories. He there, the Indian sex scripture "Kama Sutra" and, the sexual life of American young men and women recorded "Kinsey Report," these two books bought, and at the Ministry Railway platform, a copy of the Minryu Newspaper evening edition also bought.
In it, under the pen name "Mizuki Kyota," his submitted "Idle Madam Conquest War" titled refined erotic short story was printed. The theme was, a youth who doubled as a bodyguard renting a detached room from an idle widow, by a sudden clever scheme, finally the madam's body conquers, a humor-filled piece it is.
However, whether irony or coincidence, in the column below the short story Ryota wrote, the following room-for-rent advertisement was printed.
◎ Room for rent. Address XXXX. However, age 25 to 35, single.

Eventually getting up, she spread the futon for me.
It became night.
I was still sleeping. The guests making a noise like distant sounds was heard. Tonight seems a great prosperity, and it seems about ten geishas/girls have come.
Time flowed. After the playing guests returned, it became a silence like after a storm had passed.
Until that time, I was lounging in the proprietress's room. The employed servants also finished guests and tonight quietly go to sleep.
In front of the brazier, the sound of a pipe is made. The proprietress seems to still be awake and having a smoke. Finally having woken up, I, because time has considerably passed, in a great hurry to go home from the bed stepped out, then
"You, it's already late, so tonight stay over—"
The proprietress called to stop me, and again sake offered. Since I am fundamentally made of thick-skinned stuff,
"This is a problem," I repeated, scratched my head, and smoothly that night to the proprietress the limit of service I provided, and until morning, did not sleep a wink.
Since then, for three days, aimlessly I have stayed on. Nevertheless, since I maintain an attitude of not losing naivety, the proprietress, who has completely come to trust me, is now openly in a hurry to raise me from "young swallow" to "husband."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Strategy for Seducing an Idle Madam**
**How I Won the Heart (and Body) of a Beautiful Widow**
**By Akira Saotome**

Upon opening the parcel, I found a note: "To Mr. XX, from Tsuta." Tsuta was the name of the proprietress. Though I knew her face, we had no real connection. Wondering why I would receive such a gift, regardless of its contents, I immediately went to return it.

"Oh, please, don't worry about it," she said, forcibly stopping me as I tried to leave. Amidst a flurry of activity, she had snacks and sake prepared. "Come now, sit down. You're all alone, aren't you? There's no harm in it. Just think of this as your own home. I know it’s a bore being stuck with an old woman like me, but please, relax and make yourself at home."

She was quite direct. I found myself somewhat overwhelmed by her forwardness and, as prompted, accepted a drink. As we drank, the initial awkwardness faded, and our conversation grew more animated. Five cups became ten, then twenty, until I was feeling quite jovial myself.

She had clearly taken great pains with her makeup; her face appeared rejuvenated, looking no older than thirty. With a dazed, flushed expression, she leaned in close and took my hand. Pretending to be completely oblivious, I succumbed to the alcohol and fell asleep with my head in her lap. Perhaps the loneliness of a year-old widowhood had made her passions unbearable; she began to caress me quite openly.

***

Ryota was no virgin. He had lost his innocence during the war, while serving on the front lines as a mobilized student. It happened at a comfort station, just one week before his unit received their combat orders. That first encounter with a woman had been intensely provocative. Perhaps the sensual image of that woman still lingered somewhere in the back of his mind; occasionally, it would flicker back like a pang of nostalgia. But now, five years later, it was little more than a fading memory.

The reason Ryota was at the bookstore today was to study the "mechanics of marriage" to substantiate those memories. He purchased two books: the Indian classic *Kama Sutra* and the *Kinsey Report*, which detailed the sexual habits of young Americans. At the train station, he also picked up the evening edition of the *Minryu Newspaper*.

In that paper was a refined yet erotic short story titled "The Strategy for Seducing an Idle Madam," which he had submitted under the pen name Kyota Mizuki. It was a humorous piece about a young man acting as a bodyguard for a wealthy widow who, through a clever ruse, eventually conquers her. By a strange twist of irony—or perhaps fate—directly below his story was an advertisement: "Room for Rent. Address XXXX. Single males only, ages 25 to 35."

***

Eventually, she stood up and laid out the futon for me. Night fell. I remained asleep, the rowdy sounds of the guests reaching me like a distant hum. Business was booming tonight; it seemed there were more than ten girls working.

Time passed. After the last of the revelers had departed, a silence like the calm after a storm settled over the house. I remained sprawled in the proprietress’s room. The servants had finished their work and gone to sleep. From near the brazier came the sound of a tobacco pipe; it seemed she was still awake, enjoying a smoke. Finally fully awake and realizing how late it was, I scrambled out of bed to leave.

"It’s already so late," she called out, stopping me. "Why don't you just stay the night?"

She pressed more sake upon me. Being naturally thick-skinned, I played the part of the reluctant guest. "Oh, this is awkward," I muttered repeatedly, scratching my head. Yet, I stayed, and that night I provided her with the utmost "service," not sleeping a single wink until dawn.

It has been three days since then, and I am still here, idling the time away. Because I maintain an air of youthful innocence, she trusts me completely. Now, she is in a frantic hurry to promote me from her "young swallow"—her kept man—to her legal husband.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text follows the traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading from top-to-bottom and right-to-left. 
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style typical of mid-century printing. Some kanji are used in older forms (e.g., 眞 instead of 真, 處 instead of 処), which was common during the transition period after the 1946 script reforms.
*   **Visual Elements:** An illustration sits in the center-bottom, cutting into the columns of text. It depicts a man in a hat looking at a woman, drawn in a sketchy, "hekiga" (literary illustration) style common in post-war magazines.
*   **Structure:** The story is broken into three distinct sections. The first and third sections are narrated in the first person ("I"), while the middle section is a third-person narrative focusing on the character "Ryota." This suggests a "story within a story" or a meta-fictional element where Ryota is the author of the very story we are reading (or a similar one).
*   **Censorship/Privacy:** Names and addresses are replaced with "××," a common practice in "confessional" or "real-life" pulp stories to give an air of authenticity while protecting (likely fictional) identities.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasu-tori Magazines:** The text is representative of *Kasu-tori* magazines—cheap, pulp publications that flourished in Japan between 1946 and 1955. They focused on "3S" content: Screen (movies), Sport, and Sex. The term "Kasu-tori" comes from a cheap dregs-based shochu that makes you sick after three cups, just as these magazines were said to fold after three issues.
*   **Post-War Sexual Liberation:** The mention of the **Kinsey Report** (published in the US in 1948, translated into Japanese in 1949) and the **Kama Sutra** reflects the "sexual revolution" and intense curiosity about Western/scientific views on sex in post-occupation Japan.
*   **Student Mobilization (Gakusei Dōin):** The reference to the protagonist losing his virginity while mobilized for the war effort is a stark reminder of the "lost generation" of students whose youth was interrupted by WWII.
*   **Comfort Stations (Iansho):** The mention of a "comfort station" as the site of his first sexual experience reflects the historical reality of the Japanese military's sexual exploitation system during the war, often discussed with a mix of trauma and nostalgia in pulp literature of this era.
*   **"Young Swallow" (Waka-tsubame):** This is a Japanese idiom for a younger man kept by an older woman. The term originated from the affair between Raicho Hiratsuka and Hiroshi Okumura in the early 20th century.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **有閑マダム (Yūkan Madamu):** "Idle Madam." Refers to wealthy, often bored, upper-class women who have time and money for leisure or affairs.
*   **攻略戦 (Kōryakusen):** "Conquest battle" or "siege." Often used in military contexts, here applied metaphorically to seduction.
*   **空閨 (Kūkei):** Literally "empty bedroom." A literary term for a woman living without a husband (a widow or someone whose husband is away).
*   **情念 (Jōnen):** Intense emotion, passion, or sentiment, often with a sexual or obsessive undertone.
*   **煽情的 (Senjōteki):** Suggestive, inflammatory, or erotic.
*   **のらりくらり (Norari-kurari):** Aimlessly, lazily, or evasively.
*   **亭主 (Teishu):** Husband, or the master of a house.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Calculated Seduction:** The protagonist is not a passive participant but a strategist. He uses "innocence" as a weapon to gain the widow's trust while actually being experienced and knowledgeable (as evidenced by his reading of the Kinsey Report).
*   **Economic Survival:** In the post-war period, being a "kept man" (young swallow) was often a means of survival for young men struggling in a devastated economy.
*   **Meta-fiction:** The protagonist (Ryota) is an author writing about the very situation he finds himself in. Life imitates art (or pulp fiction), as seen when he finds a real-world advertisement matching the plot of his own story.
*   **The Contrast of War and Peace:** The trauma/sensuality of the wartime comfort station is contrasted with the domestic, "boring" but comfortable seduction of the widow in peacetime.
