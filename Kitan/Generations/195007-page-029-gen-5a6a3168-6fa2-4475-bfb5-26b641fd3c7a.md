**アハマの可愛い妻**

「や　が立ちまさあ」
　彼は、れつきとした亭主という言葉を特に力を入れたので、イマムは誠にそうじやという風にコツクリをした。アハマは、キュツと眉をしかめて口をとがらせ、胸を張つて憲揚に頷いた。ドクトルひとり如何にも興味なさそうに煙草をスパリ〜やりながら横つちよを向いていた。が、つと立上つて、黙って出て行つた。
「で、あつしや、三日三晩いろ〜と考えあぐねた結果、素晴らしい名案を考出しやした」
そういつてアブドラは、舌を出してペロリと上唇を舐めた。
「つまり、小ちやなコツプに、水を入分目入れて、寝台の隅つこに置いて家を出ることにしやした。その八分目というところがむつかしい所で、ちよつと多くても少なかつてもいけない、で、あつしや、三日程その分量をいろ〜変えて試めた結果、八分目つていうところに落ちついたんでさあ」
「なんだ、そりゃ？」
　イマムが言うと、
「へへへ、つまり、嫌がひとりで寝てりやその水はなんともないが、ふたりで暴れるとこぼれるつて仕掛けなんでさあー」
「な、なーるほー」
　アブドラは、得意になつて小鼻をふくらませて、アハマとイマムを交互にみつめ
「どうです、巧妙な仕掛けでしょう、で、その仕掛けをすると家を出かけました。そして翌る日帰つてきてこつそり調べてみるとどうです。見事にこぼれてるんでさ、で、あつしや、おだやかな聲で妻に言い守やした。
　おい、俺の留守中に誰かと一緒に、この寝台の上で　れやしないか？とね、すると嫌は白つぱくれて、そんなことは絶対にありませんと言う、しかし、こぼれた証拠があるぞとつめ寄ると、そりや、ひとりでもこぼすことがありますよと変なことを言やがる。
　で、俺はむか〜として、この嘘つき奴、ちやんと分つてるんだぞ、さあ言えと、嫌の髪の毛を引っ掴んでひきずり廻してやりやしたがどうしても白状しません、であつしや寝台の上にねじ伏せて首根つこを締めつけ、どうだ〜とつめ寄ると、急に、うーんと唸りやして、口からぶく〜泡を吹いたんでさあ、あつしや、おつたまげて嫌をさすつてやつたり、唇を拭いてやつたりしていると、つい、変な気が起つてきやしてねー」
　そう言つてアブドラは、変にギラ〜した眼をして唾を飲んだ。
　アハマが、にやりと、好色らしい笑みを浮かべて言った。
「ハハハン、それでわかつた。だからドタンバタンの後か大変なんだな、」
「へえ〜？——そんな音まで聞こえるんですか？たまげたねえ、ふふふじゃあ、仕方がねえ、すつかり話しちまおう。で、嫌が正氣にかえるまで、たつぷり二時　ぐらいかかります。あつしや、その間、思う存分なことをしてやれるわけで、…………」
　アハマもイマムも、瞳を輝やかして、舌舐めずりする思いで聞いている。
「やがて嫌か正氣にかえると、また、それからが格別なんで——それから家を開けるのが楽しみになつてきました。

　しかしコツプを置いとくことあ忘れませんでした。つまり、それがないとテンカンを起すまで殴ることができませんで、最初の計画が変な具合になつてきやしたが、日が経つと、そろ〜他の男のことが思われて、それが頭にこびりついて、いら〜してきました。現場　押さえたことはありませんが、一日留守をして帰つてくると、必らずコツプの水がこぼれています。
　いつたいどんな野郎が水をこぼしやがるんだろう、いちど突きとめてやろう、そう思つて、島へ行つてくると嘘をついて隣り村で遊んでから夜中にこつそり帰つてきて、明け方まで様子を窺つたんですが男の聲もしなきゃ、居るらしい氣配もねえんです、そして夜が明けてからもほんとに島から帰つたような様子をして家に入り、コツプをそつと調べてみると、水はこぼれてやしません。
　それから四五回その手を使つてみましたが駄目でさあ、そこで、へんの嫌の奴、俺がほんとに島へ行くかどうかと、その男でもつけて様子を探つてやがるんだなと思い当りやした。そう思うとあつしや、もう居ても立ってもいられぬ程腹が立ちましたよ、し、そうなると、俺にも考えがあるぞと思つて、今度はほんとに舟に乗つて沖まで行き、丁度夕方になれば帰つてこられる　所で打つて引き返えし、今度こそはひとつ現場を押えてやろうと、性根を据えて家の中の様子を覗つてみたんです、がそれでも同じなんでさあ、あつしやもう頭　変になつたようで、そのときや一日ぼんやりしてやした。
　こりゃ俺の思い過ごしやねえだろうか、そう思つて次の日は、島へほんとに出かけて明る日、それが昨夜なんですが。帰つてみると、どうです、矢張りコツプの水がこぼれているんでさあ、で、あつしや、いきなり嫌をひつぱたいて髪をねじ上げてぶん殴つてやりました。
　するとまた、うーんと唇から泡を吹

「嫌が立ちまさあ」
　彼は、「れっきとした亭主」という言葉を特に力を入れたので、イマムは「誠にそうじゃ」という風にコックリをした。アハマは、キュッと眉をしかめて口を尖らせ、胸を張って意気揚々と頷いた。ドクトル一人は、如何にも興味なさそうに煙草をスパスパやりながら横を向いていた。が、すっと立ち上がって、黙って出て行った。
「で、あっしは、三日三晩いろいろと考えあぐねた結果、素晴らしい名案を考え出しました」
そう言ってアブドラは、舌を出してペロリと上唇を舐めた。
「つまり、小さなコップに、水を八分目入れて、寝台の隅っこに置いて家を出ることにしました。その八分目というところが難しい所で、ちょっと多くても少なくてもいけない。で、あっしは、三日ほどその分量をいろいろ変えて試みた結果、八分目っていうところに落ち着いたんでさあ」
「なんだ、そりゃ？」
　イマムが言うと、
「へへへ、つまり、女房が一人で寝ていりゃその水はなんともないが、二人で暴れるとこぼれるって仕掛けなんでさあ」
「な、なるほど」
　アブドラは、得意になって小鼻を膨らませて、アハマとイマムを交互に見つめ、
「どうです、巧妙な仕掛けでしょう。で、その仕掛けをすると家を出かけました。そして翌る日帰ってきて、こっそり調べてみると、どうです。見事にこぼれてるんでさあ。で、あっしは、穏やかな声で妻に言いよりました。
『おい、俺の留守中に誰かと一緒に、この寝台の上で寝やしないか？』とな。すると女房はしらばくれて、『そんなことは絶対にありません』と言う。しかし、『こぼれた証拠があるぞ』と詰め寄ると、『そりゃ、一人でもこぼすことがありますよ』と変なことを言いやがる。
　で、俺はムカッとして、『この嘘つき奴、ちゃんと分かってるんだぞ、さあ言え』と、女房の髪の毛を引っ掴んで引きずり回してやりましたが、どうしても白状しません。であっしは、寝台の上にねじ伏せて首根っこを締めつけ、『どうだ』と詰め寄ると、急に、うーんと唸りだして、口からぶくぶくと泡を吹いたんでさあ。あっしは、仰天して女房をさすってやったり、唇を拭いてやったりしていると、つい、変な気が起きてきましてね……」
　そう言ってアブドラは、変にギラついた目をして唾を飲み込んだ。
　アハマが、にやりと、好色らしい笑みを浮かべて言った。
「ハハハン、それで分かった。だからドタンバタンの後が大変なんだな」
「へえ？——そんな音まで聞こえるんですか？たまげたねえ、ふふふ、じゃあ、仕方がねえ、すっかり話しちまおう。で、女房が正気に返るまで、たっぷり二時間ぐらいかかります。あっしは、その間、思う存分なことをしてやれるわけで……」
　アハマもイマムも、瞳を輝かせて、舌なめずりする思いで聞いている。
「やがて女房が正気に返ると、また、それからが格別なんで。それから家を空けるのが楽しみになってきました。

　しかしコップを置いとくことは忘れませんでした。つまり、それがないとてんかんを起こすまで殴ることができねえんで。最初の計画が変な具合になってきましたが、日が経つと、そろそろ他の男のことが思われて、それが頭にこびりついて、いらいらしてきました。現場を押さえたことはありませんが、一日留守をして帰ってくると、必ずコップの水がこぼれています。
　一体どんな野郎が水をこぼしやがるんだろう、一度突き止めてやろう。そう思って、『島へ行ってくる』と嘘をついて隣り村で遊んでから、夜中にこっそり帰ってきて、明け方まで様子を窺ったんですが、男の声もしなきゃ、居るらしい気配もねえんです。そして夜が明けてからも、本当に島から帰ったような様子をして家に入り、コップをそっと調べてみると、水はこぼれてやしません。
　それから四、五回その手を使ってみましたが駄目でさあ。そこで、『へんの女房の奴、俺が本当に島へ行くかどうかと、その男でもつけて様子を探ってやがるんだな』と思い当たりました。そう思うとあっしは、もう居ても立ってもいられないほど腹が立ちましたよ。で、そうなると、俺にも考えがあるぞと思って、今度は本当に舟に乗って沖まで行き、ちょうど夕方になれば帰ってこられる所で錨（いかり）を打って引き返し、今度こそは一つ現場を押さえてやろうと、性根を据えて家の中の様子を覗いてみたんです。が、それでも同じなんでさあ。あっしはもう頭が変になったようで、その時は一日ぼんやりしていました。
　こりゃ俺の思い過ごしじゃねえだろうか、そう思って次の日は、島へ本当に出かけて翌る日——それが昨夜なんですが。帰ってみると、どうです、やはりコップの水がこぼれているんでさあ。で、あっしは、いきなり女房をひっぱたいて髪をねじ上げてぶん殴ってやりました。
　するとまた、うーんと唇から泡を吹き……」

**Ahama's Lovely Wife**

"The [suspicion] stands," [he said].
Because he put special strength into the words "legitimate husband," Imam did a nodding in the manner of "truly so." Ahama squeezed his eyebrows, pouted his mouth, puffed out his chest, and nodded triumphantly. The Doctor alone, as if having no interest, while doing "puff-puff" on a cigarette, was facing sideways. But, [he] stood up abruptly and went out silently.
"So, I, result of being weary of thinking various things for three days and three nights, thought out a wonderful brilliant idea."
So saying, Abdula stuck out his tongue and licked his upper lip with a "perori."
"In other words, into a small cup, put water to eight-tenths full, place it in the corner of the bed, and decided to leave the house. That eight-tenths part is the difficult point; even a little too much or too little is no good. So, I, as a result of trying various amounts for about three days, settled on the point of eight-tenths."
"What is that?"
When Imam says [it],
"Hehehe, in other words, if the wife sleeps alone, that water is nothing, but if two people go wild, it's a device where it spills."
"Na, naruhodo (I see)."
Abdula, becoming proud, flared his nostrils, looked at Ahama and Imam alternately.
"How is it, an ingenious device, right? So, doing that device, I left the house. And coming back the next day and secretly checking, how is it. Splendidly it is spilled. So, I, with a gentle voice, said to my wife:
'Hey, while I was away, did you sleep on this bed with someone?' so. Then the wife plays innocent and says 'That kind of thing absolutely is not [true].' However, when I press her saying 'There is spilled evidence,' she says weird things like 'Well, even alone it sometimes spills.'
So, I became 'muka' (angry), 'This liar, I know it well, now speak,' and grabbed the wife's hair and dragged her around, but by all means she does not confess. So, I pinned her down on the bed, squeezed her neck, and pressed 'How about it?', [then] suddenly, she groaned 'uun' and from her mouth she blew bubbles 'buku-buku.' I, being startled, did things like rubbing the wife or wiping her lips, then, finally, a strange feeling arose in me..."
Saying so, Abdula, with strangely glinting eyes, swallowed his saliva.
Ahama, with a grin, showing a lewd-looking smile, said:
"Hahaha, then I understand. So after the 'thump-thump' [of the struggle] it's a big deal, eh?"
"Eh? — Can you hear even such sounds? I'm surprised. Fufufu, then, it can't be helped, I'll tell everything. So, until the wife returns to her senses, it takes a full two hours. I, during that time, am in a position to do things to my heart's content, and..."
Both Ahama and Imam, shining their pupils, are listening with a feeling of licking their lips.
"Eventually when the wife returns to her senses, again, from then on it's exceptional—then leaving the house became something to look forward to.

However, I did not forget to place the cup. In other words, without that I can't hit her until she has a seizure. The initial plan turned into a strange condition, but as days passed, gradually I thought of other men, and that stuck to my head and I became irritated. I have never caught her in the act, but when I return from being away for a day, without fail the cup's water is spilled.
What kind of bastard is spilling the water, I'll find out once. Thinking so, lying 'I'm going to the island,' after playing in the next village, I came back secretly in the middle of the night and watched the situation until dawn, but there was no man's voice, nor any sign of someone being there. And even after dawn, acting like I truly returned from the island, I entered the house and secretly checked the cup, and the water was not spilled.
After that I tried that trick four or five times but it was no good. So, I realized, 'That damn wife of mine, [thinking] whether I really go to the island, she must have that man or someone follow me to scout the situation.' Thinking so, I was so angry I couldn't sit or stand. Then, thinking 'I have a plan too,' this time I really got on a boat and went to the open sea, turned back at a point where I could return just at evening, and this time surely to catch her in the act, I steeled myself and peeked at the situation inside the house. But even then it was the same. I seemed to have gone crazy in the head, and at that time I was vacant for a whole day.
'Isn't this just my overthinking?' thinking so, the next day, truly going out to the island and the next day—that was last night. When I returned, how is it, as expected the water in the cup is spilled. So, I, suddenly slapped the wife, twisted up her hair and beat her up.
Then again, she blew bubbles from her lips with a groan..."

**Ahama’s Lovely Wife**

"The suspicion holds water," he declared.
Because he emphasized the words "legitimate husband" with such gravity, Imam nodded in solemn agreement. Ahama knitted his brows, pursed his lips, puffed out his chest, and gave a triumphant nod. Only the Doctor seemed entirely uninterested, puffing away on a cigarette and looking off to the side. Eventually, he stood up abruptly and left without a word.

"So," Abdula began, "after racking my brains for three days and nights, I finally came up with a brilliant plan." He stuck out his tongue and gave his upper lip a greedy lick. "Basically, I decided to fill a small cup eight-tenths full of water, place it in the corner of the bed, and then leave the house. That eight-tenths is the tricky part—a little more or a little less ruins everything. I spent three days experimenting with different amounts before I settled on that precise level."

"And what’s the point of that?" Imam asked.

"Hehehe... well, you see, if my wife sleeps alone, the water stays put. But if two people are thrashing around on the bed, it’s bound to spill. That's the trap."

"Ah, I see!"

Abdula, looking quite pleased with himself, flared his nostrils and looked back and forth between Ahama and Imam. "Clever, isn't it? So, I set the trap and left. When I came back the next day and checked—lo and behold—it was spilled! I said to my wife in a gentle voice, 'Hey, did you have someone in this bed while I was out?' She played the innocent, swearing up and down that nothing happened. But when I cornered her with the evidence of the spill, she had the nerve to say, 'Well, sometimes it spills even when I'm alone.'"

"I was furious. 'You lying cheat! I know what you’ve been up to! Now talk!' I grabbed her by the hair and dragged her around the room, but she still wouldn't confess. Finally, I pinned her down on the bed and started choking her. 'Now tell me!' I demanded. Suddenly, she let out a long groan and started foaming at the mouth. I was terrified! I started rubbing her back and wiping her lips, and well... I found myself overcome by a rather... strange impulse."

Abdula’s eyes took on a feverish glint as he swallowed hard. Ahama let out a lewd grin. "Hahaha, I get it now. So the real fun starts *after* the struggle, eh?"

"Exactly! You can hear that from where you are? I’m amazed! Well, in that case, I might as well tell you everything. It takes a good two hours for her to come back to her senses. During that time, I can do whatever I want with her..."

Ahama and Imam listened with rapt attention, their eyes gleaming with voyeuristic delight.

"And when she finally comes to," Abdula continued, "it’s even better. I’ve actually started looking forward to leaving the house! But I never forget the cup. Without it, I can't justify beating her into one of those fits. My original plan changed a bit, but as time went on, I became obsessed with the thought of another man. It was eating me alive. I’ve never caught them in the act, but whenever I'd be gone for a day, the water was always spilled.

I was determined to find out who the bastard was. I told her I was going to the island, but instead, I hung out in the next village and snuck back at night. I watched the house until dawn, but I didn't hear a man’s voice or see a trace of anyone. In the morning, I'd walk in as if I'd just returned from the island, check the cup, and it wouldn't be spilled!

I tried that trick four or five times, but no luck. I figured the wench was having someone follow me to see if I actually left. I was so angry I could barely stand it. So I thought of a counter-plan. This time, I actually got on a boat and went out to sea, but turned back just in time to return by evening. I was determined to catch her red-handed. I staked out the house and peeked inside, but it was the same story—nothing. I felt like I was losing my mind; I spent the whole next day in a daze.

I started to wonder if I was just imagining things. To be sure, I went to the island for real and came back the next day—which was last night. And what do you know? The water was spilled again! I lost it. I slapped her, grabbed her hair, and gave her a real thrashing. And then, once again, she started foaming at the mouth and groaning..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a classic Japanese vertical (tategaki) format, spanning multiple columns. The page number "30" is visible at the bottom right.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. The title is larger and bolder.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is at the top right, followed by the narrative. Two circular inset illustrations depict characters from the story: a woman (the wife) and a man (presumably Ahama or the narrator, Abdula). The illustrations are in a "hetama" (intentionally crude or populist) sketch style typical of 1950s-60s pulp magazines.
*   **Formatting Elements:** The text uses quotation marks (「」) for dialogue and "tobi-on" (prolonged sound marks like 〜) to indicate drawn-out speech or emphasis in slang. Repetition marks (いろ〜) are used for "iro-iro."

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era (1950s-1960s):** The language and themes suggest the "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine culture of post-war Japan. These magazines often featured stories of domestic suspicion, low-brow humor, and erotic/grotesque themes (ero-guro).
*   **Exoticism:** The names (Ahama, Imam, Abdula, "Dokutoru") and the mention of an "island" suggest a setting meant to be Southeast Asian or Middle Eastern, which was a common trope for adventure or "exotic" tales in Japanese popular media of the time. However, the dialogue is purely Japanese "Shitamachi" (lower-city) slang.
*   **Social Conventions:** The story depicts domestic violence and sexual coercion in a way that was normalized in pulp fiction of that era. The narrator's "device" to test his wife's fidelity reflects deep-seated anxieties about female chastity and male honor.
*   **Dialect:** The narrator uses a rough, colloquial Tokyo-style dialect (e.g., "...でさあ", "あっし", "嫌/女房"). This roots the "exotic" characters in a familiar Japanese social class—the working-class "Edokko" archetype.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **嫌 (Yatsu):** Used here as a colloquial, somewhat derogatory term for "wife" or "woman."
*   **八分目 (Hachibun-me):** 80% full. Usually used regarding eating (staying 80% full for health), but here used as a measurement for the water trap.
*   **てんかん (Tenkan):** Epilepsy or a seizure. In this context, it describes a physical fit induced by the husband's violent "interrogation."
*   **白っぱくれる (Shirappakureru):** To play innocent or feign ignorance.
*   **おったまげる (Ottamageru):** To be extremely surprised (dialectal/colloquial).
*   **正気にかえる (Shōki ni kaeru):** To return to one's senses or regain consciousness.
*   **好色 (Kōshoku):** Lustful, lewd, or amorous.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Misogyny and Violence:** The story revolves around domestic abuse presented as a "clever" game or a source of sexual excitement for the male listeners. The wife's seizure is treated as a precursor to sexual exploitation ("doing whatever I want").
*   **Voyeurism:** The structure—one man telling a story of his domestic life to two eager listeners—emphasizes the voyeuristic nature of the narrative. The readers of the magazine are essentially joining Ahama and Imam in listening to the tale.
*   **Paranoia and Control:** The "trap" highlights the husband's obsessive need to control his wife's body and his intense paranoia regarding her fidelity.
*   **The Unreliable Narrator:** The fact that the water spills *only* when he leaves "for real" and not when he is secretly watching suggests either a supernatural element, a very clever wife, or that the narrator's own actions (perhaps in his sleep or through his violence) are causing the spills.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Fiction.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Domestic violence, Infidelity, Suspicion, Misogyny, Exoticism, Shitamachi dialect, Post-war Japan.
*   **Flags:** Contains depictions of violence and non-consensual situations.
