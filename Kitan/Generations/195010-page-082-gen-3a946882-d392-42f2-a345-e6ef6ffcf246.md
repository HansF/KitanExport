## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Surely, to the prostitute's place he went, no doubt," Arata, with a rival's sensitivity, so decided.
He, by what method the two's love-relationship split should he, in various ways a plan revolved.
—Next day's still past-noon, Arata regarding construction progress business, one *ri* and more down office toward went.
Yamakawa, Arata again town-to down-went understood, in-heart excited feeling was.
He, while sun high was, laborers' hut exited. And then on the way road changed, again O-sumi's lodging visited.
Last night's pleasure, finally Yamakawa that prisoner made.
"Yamakawa-san, I, think-if think-extent, our future things are worried. Arata, forever silent will not be."
"Being worried is natural, but then what to do you say?"
"Instead, from this mountain run away...?"
"Fool, even if 'zura-ed' (fled), immediately from that day eating troubled will be."
"Then I, cook-woman quit, to home-village return maybe, annoying Arata from want to separate."
"Well, a little more situation see, after that do better."
Arata from distancing thing, at same time Yamakawa from separating thing was. O-sumi by mouth so said try-even-if, beloved Yamakawa with by all means not want to separate. What a cynical fate it would be.

—Yamakawa and O-sumi, night late until embraced talked. Talk-though talk-though not-exhausted. To that a break putting, Yamakawa back went thing 10 o'clock a little past after was. Outside strong wind-rain was.
Story changes, past-noon Ohno's office to went Arata, evening-darkness approaching 8 o'clock past laborers' hut to back came.
Arata, Yamakawa's absence knowing, in-heart greatly resented.
However, that resentment bubbling boiling that not, to the end inside-trapped cold thing was.
"Damn it, now watch."
Arata in mouth mumble-mumble whispered. And then his private room into went, willow-crate bottom from, blade-length seven-sun dagger grabbed-out.
"Hmph..." and Arata coldly laughed. He if gets angry, human one-piece's life such as dog-like handle feeling becomes.
"Gosuke," through wall called.
"Yes."
"In your room doburoku (sake) remains not?"
Gosuke called laborer, rustle-rustle doing was, but immediately one-sho bottle grasping Arata's room to came.
"Drinking is it?"
"Natural, you also not do?"
Dried squid tearing, self-pouring gulp-gulp started doing.
Occasionally he, above-head pillar-clock shook-looked. Each time, time as-if-whispering self-spoke. Head cleared-back, even-if-drink not-drunk. Partner Gosuke, five-go about drank and fell-over.
Well, Yamakawa guy not-yet-back while, Arata waist raised time, rain falling-maybe window-through flash eye-membranes pierced.
"It's raining, damn it."
Arata as-if-groaning said, dagger breast-pocket into put.

### Vanished Life

Rain-in drenched becoming while, grass-thicket inside Arata breath killed Yamakawa waited. Thousand-autumn feeling was. Human life taking sensation, strangely to him did not well-up.
How much waited probably—
"Came!" so Arata in-heart shouted.
Wind-rain sound mixed-in footsteps just-before heard.
Black shadow, through-pass-trying did, that instant,
"Wait, you!"
Sudden, thick low-voice in ghostly-air felt black shadow, two-three steps, unconsciously jumped.
"Who is it?"
"Me."
Arata black shadow to approaching went.
"Ah, Arata-san..."
That sobbing voice not-vanished while, same owner's, high scream rose, next already agony-to changed had. Aim not-missed, heart's center pierced had.
Arata, stabbed dagger not-pulling, hand released partner's waist thud-kick-sent-flying.
Arata, Yamakawa's corpse on back carried, from there slightly separated reservoir until carrying went, water-sound high threw-in.
After that, blood-stained his shirt, stone-in-wrapped threw-away.
—Vacation ended, laborers all gathered time, they Yamakawa's figure vanished to noticed.
—Where go-did-he?
"O-sumi is where looking-at, 'zura-ed' (fled) not surely,"
"That guy, 16th evening, town to down-come saying went-out-since, once-even not-back."
Laborers various rumors mutually-did. However, Yamakawa's absence and, Arata's actions linking, mouth-to-put person even-one not-was.
O-sumi as-usual commuting was. Suddenly, what premonition-without vanished-away Yamakawa, resentful also, sad also was. Leave-if, why I also together not-take...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"I’ll bet my life he’s off with some whore," Arata muttered, his jealousy honing his instincts to a sharp edge. He spent his time plotting, obsessively turning over ways to tear the two lovers apart.

The following afternoon, Arata headed down to the office about a league away to discuss the progress of the construction work. Yamakawa, assuming Arata had gone back to town for the day, felt a surge of excitement. He slipped out of the laborers' barracks while the sun was still high, took a detour, and went to visit O-sumi at her lodgings. The pleasures of the previous night had already made him a slave to her charms.

"Yamakawa-san, the more I think about it, the more I worry about our future," O-sumi said. "Arata won't stay quiet forever."
"It’s natural to worry, but what do you want me to do?"
"What if... what if we just ran away from this mountain?"
"Don't be a fool. If we bolt, we'll be starving before the day is out."
"Then maybe I should quit being a cook here and go back to my village. I just want to get away from that suffocating Arata."
"Now, now. Let's just wait a bit longer and see how things go."
Distancing herself from Arata meant separating from Yamakawa as well. No matter what O-sumi said, she couldn't bear the thought of being away from the man she loved. It was a cruel irony of fate.

The lovers talked late into the night, their words never seemingly enough. It was shortly after ten when Yamakawa finally tore himself away to head back. Outside, a heavy wind and rain had begun to lash the landscape.

Meanwhile, Arata had returned to the barracks shortly after eight, as twilight deepened. When he realized Yamakawa was missing, a fierce rage gripped him. But it wasn't a hot, boiling anger; it was cold and contained, simmering deep within.
"Damn you. Just you wait," Arata hissed under his breath. He went into his private room and, from the bottom of a willow trunk, pulled out a seven-inch dagger.
He let out a cold, sharp laugh. When Arata was this angry, a human life meant no more to him than a dog's.

"Gosuke!" he barked through the thin wall.
"Yeah?"
"You got any *doburoku* left in there?"
Gosuke, a laborer, could be heard rummaging around before appearing in Arata's room with a large bottle of unrefined sake.
"You drinkin' tonight?"
"Damn right. You having some?"
Arata began tearing at some dried squid, gulping down the sake. Every so often, he glanced up at the wall clock, muttering the time to himself as if in a trance. His mind was unnervingly clear; no matter how much he drank, he remained stone-cold sober. Gosuke, on the other hand, polished off nearly a quart and passed out cold.

Finally, deciding it was time before Yamakawa returned, Arata stood up. Just then, a flash of lightning pierced through the window, stinging his eyes. 
"It's pouring," Arata groaned, tucking the dagger into his coat.

### Extinguished Life

Drenched to the bone, Arata crouched in the thicket, holding his breath as he waited for Yamakawa. Every second felt like an eternity. Strangely, the reality of what it meant to take a human life didn't register with him at all.
He didn't know how long he waited—until finally, "He's here!" Arata screamed silently.
Through the roar of the wind and rain, he heard footsteps approaching. A dark shadow tried to pass by. In that split second:
"Hold it right there!"
Startled by the sudden, low, menacing voice, the shadow recoiled a few steps.
"Who's that?"
"It's me."
Arata stepped toward the shadow.
"Ah... Arata-san..."
Before the sobbing voice could even finish, a sharp scream rang out, quickly dissolving into a moan of agony. Arata hadn't missed; he had driven the blade straight through the man's heart. Without even pulling the dagger out, Arata let go and kicked the body aside.

He hoisted Yamakawa's corpse onto his back, carried it to a nearby reservoir, and heaved it in with a heavy splash. Then he wrapped his blood-stained shirt around a stone and threw that in after it.

When the workers gathered after the break, they realized Yamakawa was gone.
"Where the hell did he go?"
"Well, O-sumi's still here, so he didn't just bolt on her."
"The guy said he was going to town on the night of the sixteenth, and nobody's seen him since."
The laborers traded rumors, but not a single soul dared to link Yamakawa's disappearance with Arata's movements. O-sumi continued her work as usual, but she was filled with a mix of resentment and sorrow for the man who had vanished without a word. *If he was going to leave,* she thought, *why didn't he take me with him?*

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** This is a classic two-column vertical layout typical of Japanese literary magazines from the early to mid-Showo era. The text flows from top-to-bottom and right-to-left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho style. It uses *Kyu-kanji* (traditional characters like 「戀」 for love, 「處」 for place, 「樣」 for manner) and *Kyu-kana* (historical kana usage, such as 「は」 for 「わ」 in specific contexts and 「つ」 for 「っ」).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the story segment, **"消えた生命" (Extinguished Life)**, is centered and set in a larger, bolder font to distinguish the climax of the scene from the preceding exposition.
*   **Illustration:** A small, atmospheric woodcut-style illustration is placed in the center-left. It depicts a dark, stormy landscape with trees, enhancing the "noir" or "pulp" mood of the murder scene.
*   **Pagination:** A small page number (82) is visible at the bottom center, framed in parentheses.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (late 1940s-1950s):** The linguistic style and the setting suggest the immediate post-war period. The use of traditional kanji suggests it's on the earlier side of the orthographic transition (pre-1946 reform or early transitional period).
*   **Social Setting:** The story takes place at a remote construction site or labor camp (*doya/ninfu-goya*). This was common in post-war Japan during the massive reconstruction efforts. The characters are "laborers" (*tosa* or *ninfu*) and "cooks" (*suijifu*).
*   **The "Dosu" (七首):** The weapon used, a *dosu* (translated as a seven-inch dagger), is an iconic weapon in Japanese crime fiction and Yakuza lore. It is a concealed short sword without a guard (*tsuba*).
*   **Language of the Working Class:** The dialogue uses rough, masculine forms (e.g., *zura-katsu-ta*, *kone-e*, *shine-e*), reflecting the unrefined social status of the laborers.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **女郎 (Joro):** A prostitute. Used here as a derogatory assumption about Yamakawa's whereabouts.
*   **人夫小屋 (Ninfu-goya):** Laborers' barracks or bunkhouses.
*   **柳行季 (Yanagi-gori):** A traditional trunk or suitcase made of woven willow.
*   **七首 (Dosu/Shichisun):** Literally "seven-sun" (approx. 21cm). Slang for a dagger or short sword.
*   **どぶ酒 (Doburoku):** Unrefined, home-brewed sake. Often associated with rural areas and the working class.
*   **ズラかつた (Zurakatta):** Slang for "ran away" or "bolted." Modern equivalent is *zurakaru*.
*   **土方 (Tosa/Hijikata):** A construction laborer. In modern Japanese, this is often considered a discriminatory or derogatory term (NG word), but it was standard for the era.
*   **スルメ (Surume):** Dried squid, a common cheap snack to accompany drinking.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Jealousy and Toxic Masculinity:** Arata's motive is purely possessive. He views O-sumi as a prize and Yamakawa as a "competitor" rather than a person.
*   **The Devaluation of Life:** The text explicitly states that Arata views human life as no more valuable than a dog's. This "hardboiled" cynicism is a hallmark of post-war pulp fiction (*Kasutori* literature).
*   **Isolation:** The setting of the "mountain" and the "construction camp" creates an environment where law and order are distant, allowing for a "frontier justice" or cold-blooded murder to go unpunished.
*   **Irony:** The ending is particularly dark; O-sumi believes Yamakawa abandoned her, never realizing he was murdered because of his love for her. She resents the dead man while continuing to live near his killer.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Fiction.

*   **Thematic Tags:** Murder, Jealousy, Post-war Japan, Laborers, Betrayal, Irony.
