「ひえー？ 殺されたんか？」
「殺されちゃ俺だつてこうのんびり此処に立つているもんか、実は、アブドラの奴が女房を切りつけたんだ」
「バラン（山刀）でか？」
「うんにや、小さなナイフだがな、アブドラの奴、俺んちとこへ元気のない顔をして朝つぱらからのこのこやつてきやがつたから、なんだ、また女房とけんかして別れ話でも持つてきたのかと聞くと、言うことがふるつてるじやねえか、ナイフの奴が、女に打つかつたからなんとかしてくれと言う。で、俺が、お前、女房を切りつけたのと違うか？ と聞くと、まあそうだと言う。俺や、腹が立つて血が出たらうと！言つてやると、たんとは出ないが少し出たらしい。で、ドクトルを呼んだかと訊くと、呼べねえと言やがるんだ、変なこと言やがると思つて、呼べぬえだあどういうわけだと言うと、呼ぶわけにいかんから呼べないともつともなことを言やがる」
「ワッハッハッハッ」
「それからがんじんの話だが、いつたいお前、女房の何処を切つたんだと幾度聞いても場所を言わねえ、俺や、また腹を立て、首でも切り離したのかと怒鳴つてやると、うんにや、言うに言えぬえからわざ／＼こうやつて出て来たんだ頼むからなんとかしてくれ、そう言つて俺の袖を引つ張つてどうしても場所をあかさない。」
「いつたい何處を切りつけたんだ」
「それがよへへへッ、あ、笑いごとじやないぞ、えーと、俺もちよつと言わないことにする、言えぬえこともないが言わない方がよさそうだ、見りやわかるんだから、じや、ボチ／＼行こう」
　そう言つてイマムは先に立つて、ひよいと高い床から地面に飛び降りると身軽にスタコラ／＼つい隣りのアブドラの家に向つて歩き出した。アハマもその後に続いた。ふたり共はだしである。
大きな椰子の葉が、そよ風に揺れている。
　部落の一番はずれにアハマのと並んでアドブラの家があり、百坪ばかりのバナナ畠を隔てゝ海岸傅いた家々がポツン／＼と並んでいる。皆、床の高い丸太で組んだ、椰子の葉とその芯で造つた家ばかりである。
　手をつけたら染まりそうな藍色の静かな海遠くに小さな島々が点々と水平線を背にして浮かび上がつている。
　頑丈な荒けづりの板戸を開けてイマムとアハマは家の中に這入つた。椰子の葉が芯を並べて造つた仕切りの向うからアブドラが、ひよいと顔を覗かせたが急にかくれてしまった。
「おーい、アハマを連れてきたぞ」
そう言つてイマムは猫のように指の開いた汚い大きなはだしの足を仕切りまで運んで中を覗きこんだ。
それから「ひえー」
と悲鳴を上げて、骨張つた汚ならしい手で口を掩うと、腰をかがめて笑いをこらえた。
　アハマの呑気そうな顔が急に引きしまつて、眼が生々と輝やいた。彼は、如何なる迫害があろうとも、この大事件の真相を掴まんけりやならんと、颯と腰をかがめると首つ玉だけを亀の子の様に持ち上げ、イマムをぐいツと肘で押し除けて仕切りからぬーツと首を差し出して中の中の様子をうかがつた。
　アブドラとドクトルが真妙な顔をして腰掛けている（それはどうでもいいのだ）その前に丸木の寝台があつて、ドクトルの手が邪魔になつて顔は見えぬが、アドブラの女房が寝ているらしい（え、それもどうでもいいのだ）
アハマは瞳をこらした。変なものがあるんだ、むーつとするような柔らかな腹の両側に、肉づきのよい太股がによつきりと三本立つている、その付け根の、いつも薄暗い筈の濕地帯が、これは又、陽にさらされた怪物のよう正体を明らさまに現わしている。見ると、ドクトルが有難いお札でも張るように、黄色い薬をべつとりと塗りたくつた大きなガーゼを、その怪物に張りつけてしまつた。
　アハマは眼の玉が飛び出る程驚いて、大きな吐息をつくと、いまにも卒倒せんばかりにくる／＼と眼玉を動かせて、そーつと首をひつ込め、イマムがしたと同じように素早く唇に手を当て、耐えられぬようなうめき聲を発しながら地團駄を踏んだ。
　イマムは泣きはらしたように涙を溜めた赤い眼をこすつて片手で顎をゆすつていたが、アハマが地團駄を踏んだのでつりこまれて、とう／＼七轉八倒の苦しみを味わつた。

「ひえー？ 殺されたのか？」
「殺されちゃ俺だってこうのんびり此処に立っているもんか。実は、アブドラの奴が女房を切りつけたんだ」
「パラン（山刀）でか？」
「うんにゃ、小さなナイフだがな。アブドラの奴、俺んちの方へ元気のない顔をして朝っぱらからのこのこやってきやがったから、なんだ、また女房と喧嘩して別れ話でも持ってきたのかと聞くと、言うことがふるってるじゃねえか。ナイフの奴が、女に当たったからなんとかしてくれと言う。で、俺が、『お前、女房を切りつけたのと違うか？』と聞くと、まあそうだと言う。俺は、腹が立って『血が出たろう！』と言ってやると、たんとは出ないが少し出たらしい。で、ドクトルを呼んだかと訊くと、呼べねえと言いやがるんだ。変なことを言うなと思って、『呼べねえとはどういうわけだ』と言うと、『呼ぶわけにいかんから呼べない』ともっともなことを言いやがる」
「ワッハッハッハッ」
「それから肝心の話だが、一体お前、女房のどこを切ったんだと何度聞いても場所を言わねえ。俺は、また腹を立てて『首でも切り離したのか』と怒鳴ってやると、『うんにゃ、言うに言えねえからわざわざこうやって出て来たんだ、頼むからなんとかしてくれ』そう言って俺の袖を引っ張って、どうしても場所を明かさない」
「一体どこを切りつけたんだ」
「それがよ、へへへっ。あ、笑いごとじゃないぞ。えーと、俺もちょっと言わないことにする。言えねえこともないが言わない方がよさそうだ。見りゃわかるんだから。じゃ、ぼちぼち行こう」

「おーい、アハマを連れてきたぞ」
そう言ってイマムは猫のように指の開いた汚い大きな裸足の足を仕切りまで運んで中を覗き込んだ。
それから「ひえー」
と悲鳴を上げて、骨張った汚らしい手で口を覆うと、腰を屈めて笑いをこらえた。
　アハマののんきそうな顔が急に引き締まって、目が生き生きと輝いた。彼は、いかなる迫害があろうとも、この大事件の真相を掴まなければならないと、さっと腰を屈めると首根っこだけを亀の子のように持ち上げ、イマムをぐいっと肘で押し除けて仕切りからぬーっと首を差し出して中の様子をうかがった。

　アハマは瞳を凝らした。変なものがあるんだ。むっとするような柔らかな腹の両側に、肉付きの良い太腿がにょっきりと三本立っている。その付け根の、いつも薄暗い筈の湿地帯が、これはまた、陽にさらされた怪物のように正体をあらわに現している。見ると、ドクトルがありがたいお札でも貼るように、黄色い薬をべったりと塗りたくった大きなガーゼを、その怪物に貼り付けてしまった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Adobura

"Hie—? Was [she] killed?"
"If [she] were killed, me too like this leisurely here standing would I be? In truth, that fellow Adobura his wife [he] cut."
"With a parang (mountain knife)?"
"No, a small knife it was. That fellow Adobura, to my place with a spiritless face from early morning nonchalantly having come, 'What, again with wife quarreled and talk of parting even brought?' when I asked, what [he] says is remarkable, isn't it? 'The knife fellow, into the woman bumped, so do something' [he] says. So, I, 'You, wife cutting is different [from what happened]?' when asked, 'Well, that is so' [he] says. I, getting angry, 'Blood must have come out!' when I said, 'Much does not come out, but a little came out it seems.' So, 'Doctor [did you] call?' when asked, 'Cannot call' [he] dared to say. Thinking [he] says strange things, 'Cannot call—what is the reason?' when I said, 'Because I cannot call, I cannot call' such a plausible thing [he] dared to say."
"Wah-hah-hah-hah!"
"Then the essential story, 'Exactly you, wife where did [you] cut?' however many times asked the place [he] does not say. I, again getting angry, 'The neck even did [you] sever?' when I shouted, 'No, saying cannot say so purposely like this [I] came out, please do something,' so saying my sleeve pulling by all means the place [he] does not reveal."
"Exactly where did [he] cut?"
"That is, you see, he-he-he. Ah, a laughing matter it is not. Uh, I too for a bit not saying will decide. Not being able to say it is not, but not saying seems better. If [you] see, [you] will understand, so, well, slowly let's go."
So saying Imam ahead standing, lightly from high floor to ground jumping down, nimbly suta-kora (scurrying) right to the neighboring Adobura's house toward started walking. Ahama also after followed. Both of them barefoot are.
Large coconut leaves, in the breeze are swaying.
At the very edge of the village, lined up with Ahama's, Adobura's house is, a 100-tsubo-sized banana field separating, along-the-coast houses dots here and there are lined up. All, floor-high logs assembled, coconut leaves and their cores made houses only they are.
Hand if put in likely to be dyed indigo-colored quiet sea. Far away small islands dots here and there horizon at back rising up are.
Sturdy roughly-planed wooden door opening, Imam and Ahama house inside entered. Coconut leaf cores lined up and made partition from beyond Adobura, lightly face peeped but suddenly hid.
"Hey, Ahama [I] brought."
So saying Imam like a cat toes spread dirty large barefoot feet to partition carried and inside peeped.
Then "Hie—"
screaming, bony dirty hand with mouth covering, waist bending laughter suppressed.
Ahama's carefree-looking face suddenly tightened, eyes lively sparkled. He, whatever persecution there may be, this great incident's truth grab must, quickly waist bending neck-ball only like a turtle's child lifted, Imam firmly with elbow pushing aside from partition nuu-tto neck inserting inside situation peered.
Adobura and Doctor serious faces doing are sitting (that does not matter). In front of them log bed exists, Doctor's hand becoming an obstacle face is not seen, but Adobura's wife sleeping it seems (Eh, that too does not matter).
Ahama eyes strained. A strange thing exists. A stifling soft belly's both sides, fleshy good thighs straight three are standing. Their base, always dim supposed-to-be wetland, this again, to the sun exposed monster like true identity clearly revealing. Seeing, Doctor a grateful talisman even as if sticking, yellow medicine thickly smeared large gauze, onto that monster stuck.
Ahama eye balls to the extent of jumping out surprised, a large sigh letting out, even now about to faint roll-roll eye balls moving, slowly neck pulling back, Imam did same way quickly lips to hand applying, unbearable groan-voice emitting while stamping feet in frustration.
Imam like having cried his eyes out tears-pooled red eyes rubbing one hand with chin was shaking, but Ahama stamping feet because [he] was drawn in, finally seven-falls-eight-rises (writhing) agony tasted.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Adobura**

"Wh—?! You mean she’s dead?"
"If she were dead, do you think I’d be standing here looking so relaxed? The truth is, that idiot Adobura went and slashed his wife."
"With a *parang*?"
"No, just a small knife. But listen to this—the fellow shows up at my place first thing this morning looking like he’d lost his last friend. I asked him, 'What’s the matter now? Another fight? Come to talk about a divorce again?' And you won't believe the nerve of him. He says, 'The knife... it sort of ran into her. You’ve got to do something.' So I said, 'You mean you cut her, didn't you?' and he actually admits it. I got so fed up, I shouted, 'There must have been blood everywhere!' He told me there wasn't much, but enough. Then I asked if he’d called the Doctor. He had the gall to say he couldn't. When I asked why on earth not, he just gave me some nonsense about how he 'couldn't call him because he couldn't call him.'"
"Hah-hah-hah-hah!"
"But here’s the best part. No matter how many times I asked where he’d cut her, he wouldn't say a word. I lost my temper again and roared, 'What, did you cut her head off or something?' and he just tugs at my sleeve, whimpering, 'No, it’s just that I can't bring myself to say it. That’s why I came to get you. Please, just come and help.' He refused to come clean about where the wound was."
"So, where *did* he cut her?"
"Well, you see... Heh-heh-heh. Hey, stop laughing! Look, I’m not going to be the one to tell you. I *could*, but it’s better if I don't. You’ll see for yourself soon enough. Come on, let’s get moving."
With that, Imam took the lead, hopping down from the high floor of the stilt house and scurrying off toward Adobura’s place next door. Ahama followed close behind. Both were barefoot.
Large palm fronds swayed gently in the breeze.
Adobura’s house stood at the very edge of the village, right next to Ahama’s. They were separated from the other houses along the coast by a quarter-acre banana grove. Every house was the same: built high off the ground on log stilts, with walls and roofs made of coconut leaves and stems.
The sea was a quiet, deep indigo—so rich you felt your hands might be stained if you touched it. Far out on the horizon, small islands sat like dark silhouettes against the sky.
Opening the heavy, rough-hewn wooden door, Imam and Ahama stepped inside. From behind a partition made of coconut stems, Adobura poked his head out for a second before ducking back into hiding.
"Hey! I brought Ahama!" Imam called out.
He padded over to the partition on his large, dirty, splayed feet, moving as quietly as a cat, and peered over.
Then, he let out a sharp "Gah!"
He clapped a bony, grimy hand over his mouth and doubled over, shaking with suppressed laughter.
The lazy look vanished from Ahama’s face, and his eyes lit up with curiosity. Determined to uncover the truth of this "incident" regardless of the cost, he bent low and craned his neck like a turtle. Elbowing Imam out of the way, he thrust his head past the partition to see what was happening.
There sat Adobura and the Doctor, both looking terribly solemn (not that Ahama cared about them). In front of them was a bed made of logs. The Doctor’s hands blocked his view of the woman’s face, but Adobura’s wife was clearly lying there (not that he cared about her, either).
Ahama strained his eyes. Something was very strange. There, on either side of a soft, pale belly, were three—yes, three—well-fleshed thighs sticking straight up. The "wetland" at the base of them, which usually remained in the shadows, was now exposed to the light like some sort of bared monster. As he watched, the Doctor took a large piece of gauze slathered in yellow ointment and slapped it onto the "monster" as if he were pinning up a holy talisman.
Ahama’s eyes nearly popped out of his head. He let out a massive sigh, his eyeballs spinning as if he were about to faint. He jerked his head back, clapped his hand over his mouth just as Imam had done, and began stomping his feet in a frantic, silent groan.
Imam was still rubbing his red, watery eyes and shaking his head, but seeing Ahama’s reaction, he was set off all over again, and the two of them writhed together in a fit of agonizing laughter.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is formatted in a traditional Japanese vertical layout (tategaki). It is divided into two main columns of text.
*   **Typography:** It uses a standard Mincho typeface typical of mid-20th-century printing. Notably, it uses "old kana" conventions (resembling pre-WWII or early post-WWII style), though it does include small kana for "tsu" and glides (like ゃ), which became more standard in the late 1940s.
*   **Illustrations:**
    *   Top right: A portrait of a man (likely "Adobura") wearing a headwrap or songkok, suggesting a Southeast Asian (Indonesian/Malay) cultural context.
    *   Bottom right: A portrait of a woman (labeled "Adobura's Wife" / アドブラの細君) with a headscarf.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "アドブラ" is placed at the top of the first column. The use of quotation marks 「」 clearly delineates the heavy use of dialogue.
*   **Pagination:** A simple "-28-" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is a single leaf from a larger magazine or anthology.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Setting:** The text mentions "Baran" (Parang - a type of machete common in the Malay archipelago), "Imam" (a religious leader/title in Islamic communities), and houses made of "coconut leaves and logs" (stilt houses). This strongly suggests a setting in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) or British Malaya during the colonial or immediate post-colonial era.
*   **Era:** Given the linguistic style (orthography) and the exoticized depiction of Southeast Asian life, this likely dates to the **1940s or 1950s**. During and after WWII, Japanese interest in the "Southern Regions" (Nampo) was high, leading to many travelogues and fictional stories set in these areas.
*   **Medicine:** The "Doctor" (referred to as *Dokutoru*) represents Western/modern medicine introduced to a rural, "primitive" setting. The use of "yellow medicine" likely refers to Acrinol (Rivanol), a common antiseptic of that era.
*   **Social Taboo:** The humor in the story stems from a "wound" in a private area that the husband is too embarrassed to name, and which the observers find hilariously scandalous once they see the medical treatment in progress.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **アドブラ (Adobura):** Likely a Japanese phoneticization of the name "Abdullah."
*   **バラン (Baran):** A Japanese rendering of the Malay/Indonesian word *Parang*, a large knife or machete.
*   **ドクトル (Dokutoru):** From the Dutch *Doctor*. Commonly used in Japanese literature of the early to mid-20th century to refer to a physician, particularly in colonial or European contexts.
*   **うんにや (Unnya):** A colloquial/dialectal version of "No."
*   **朝つぱら (Asappara):** An informal/rough way of saying "early morning."
*   **ふるってる (Furutteru):** Slang for "unusual," "remarkable," or "absurd" (from *furuu*).
*   **地團駄を踏む (Jidanda wo fumu):** To stamp one's feet in frustration or, in this case, intense emotion (laughter/shock).
*   **七轉八倒 (Shitten-batto):** "Falling seven times and getting up eight." Usually means writhing in great pain or agony, here used hyperbolically for uncontrollable laughter.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Exotic" South:** The text reflects a Japanese gaze upon Southeast Asia, portraying the inhabitants as somewhat primitive, comical, and highly emotional.
*   **Domestic Comedy:** Despite the potential gravity of a stabbing, the story treats it as a farce. The "mystery" of the wound's location serves as a comedic MacGuffin.
*   **Gaze and Voyeurism:** The narrative focuses heavily on the act of "peeking" (*nozuki*) and the shock of seeing the female body in a medical/exposed state.
*   **Masculine Camaraderie:** The dialogue between Imam and Ahama is rough and informal, centered on shared amusement at the expense of Adobura’s embarrassment.
