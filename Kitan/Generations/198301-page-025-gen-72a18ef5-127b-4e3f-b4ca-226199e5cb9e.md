## Normalized Japanese (現代仮名遣い)

騒がしいと知られても憚らず、我が身を嫌うのを、妻の妻たる言葉とも言い、じっと物に言わず、あやらかに（厳かに）姑の言葉に付き従い、見られている妻は、それを妻たらしめ、言動を慎む（葉を慎しむ）。これも妻が良く聡い三つの事にはあらず。

委細は、**婦容**は湯浴みをし、髪を整え、身持ちを保ち、常に姿を整え、取り乱しさを除くことを言い、**婦功**とは、婦人が常に行うべき仕事である。来客が常にいれば、織物などを手繰り（たどひ）、これは妻の**大徳**に繋がる常の事である。この四つを家を治める道と知るべきである。

師として習い、父として子を訓戒し、道を教えるべきではあるが、今より国を立てねばならず、名誉を重んじる妻にはなるまい。この四つを止めなければ（守らなければ）母にはなるまい。

○（娘である）君は、常に家にいる子たる間は、家を仕切る事、些細な過ちも背くべからず、従兄たちを敬い親しむ事、姉君に仕えるつるのように立派に成るべきである。この教えを守るべきである。古典を読ませ、道理を深く理解させたいと望み、道理を貶めさせるような事（恥じるような事）を軽々しくしなければ、心ならずとも過ちを犯してしまう。悪い言葉や良い言葉を（本意でないまま）口走ってしまい、道理を心得ていない人に交われば、篇を読んで良く覚悟させねばならないけれども、今より国を立てねばならず、名誉を重んじる妻にはなるまい。この四つを守らなければ母にはなるまい。

## Literal English Translation

It is called the word of a wife, to avoid showing distaste for one's body even when one knows they are known to be noisy/troublesome, and to quietly observe the words of the mother-in-law without speaking out, following carefully; a wife who does this, making herself a wife, restricts her words (葉をついしみる). These are not the three things a wife should be sharply skilled at.

Details: **Wifely Appearance (婦容)** is defined as bathing, styling the hair, maintaining one's posture, always keeping one's figure neat, and eliminating slovenliness. **Wifely Work (婦功)** is the duty that the wife must constantly perform. If there are always guests, she manages weaving and similar crafts, and this constantly leads to the Wife's **Great Virtue (大徳)**. These Four [Practices] should be known as the way to manage the household.

It is necessary to learn and, as a father, to instruct the child and teach the path (doctrine), but if the nation is not established from now on, she will not be a wife who values her name (honor). If these four are not maintained, she will not be a mother.

○ You, the (daughter) who constantly resides in the house as a child, must manage the household affairs, and must not turn your back on even the slightest failing. You should honor and be friendly with your cousins, and succeed like a crane serving your elder sister/mistress. This teaching must be preserved. Although one wishes for her to read classical texts, understand doctrine, and realize principles without shame, if she treats doctrine lightly, she will commit involuntary errors. If she consorts with people who do not understand reason, and if poor words and good words are not based on genuine intent, she must be made to read the texts and grasp the necessary resolve. Nevertheless, if the nation is not established from now on, she will not be a wife who values her name. If these four are not maintained, she will not be a mother.

## Literary English Translation

A wife’s virtue is measured by her discretion—she should not appear disturbed or reveal her discomfort even when she knows her physical self is observed or rumored about. She must follow the words of her mother-in-law quietly and meticulously, never speaking out rashly. A wife who acts thus, striving for her wifely role, holds her tongue. However, these alone are not the three qualities in which a wife must be keenly adept.

Specifically, **Wifely Appearance (Fuyō)** requires bathing, styling the hair, maintaining dignified posture, always keeping her form immaculate, and purging all signs of sloppiness. **Wifely Work (Fukō)** is the labor a woman must constantly engage in. When guests are frequent, she must attend to weaving and similar crafts; this is a perpetual duty tied to the Wife’s **Great Virtue (Taitoku)**. These four [categories of duty] must be understood as the path to governing a household.

The husband and father must study this doctrine himself, instructing and guiding the child along the proper path. If we fail to build up the nation starting now, she will not be an honorable wife. If these Four Virtues are not upheld, she will not be a mother.

O Daughter, while you remain a child dwelling in this house, you must manage household duties and never shirk even the smallest responsibility. You must honor and be cordial with your cousins and serve your elder sister/mistress with the perfection of a crane. This teaching you must hold fast to. One hopes you will read the classics, understand moral reasoning, and realize these truths without embarrassment. Yet, if you treat morality lightly, you will inevitably commit unintentional mistakes. If she associates with those who lack principle, and if her speech (be it praise or criticism) is not based on genuine sincerity, she must be made to study these texts and grasp true resolution. Nevertheless, if we do not establish the nation starting now, she will not be an honorable wife. If these four are not upheld, she will not be a mother.

## Structural & Editorial Analysis

| Field | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Didactic / Moralizing Instructional Essay, presented as an excerpt or summary of traditional (likely Confucian) female ethics. Used possibly as filler, a serious commentary on social decay, or an ironic juxtaposition against the magazine's typically transgressive content. |
| **Author Attribution** | Unattributed. The tone suggests an established editor or a recognized scholar/moralist providing classical instruction. |
| **Editorial Voice** | Highly prescriptive, moralistic, traditional, and serious. It uses archaic terminology (婦容, 婦功, 嘉言, 歴史的仮名遣い), signaling authority and reverence for classical texts/values. |
| **Narrator Voice** | Third-person omniscient, addressing the young female reader ("君" - You, the daughter) directly in the latter half, shifting from describing the ideal wife to commanding the young reader's behavior. |
| **Target Audience Signals**| Explicitly targets young women/daughters ("君," "子"), detailing preparations for marriage and motherhood. The broader audience (*Kitan Club* readers) likely consumed this content either as moral background, satirical fodder, or fetishized conservative constraints. |
| **Positioning** | Appears on page 25. Given the lack of a preceding title, this is likely the continuation of a longer essay or feature column, perhaps related to societal customs or the "proper" role of women in the Showa era. |
| **Key Organizing Principle**| The classical Four Virtues (婦徳, 婦言, 婦容, 婦功), though the text explicitly names only two (婦容, 婦功) and refers to the combined four (此四ツ). |

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

| Term/Concept | Annotation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **婦容, 婦功, 婦徳, 婦言** | The traditional Four Virtues of women, derived from Confucian texts (especially the *Admonitions for Women*). These concepts formed the backbone of feudal and Meiji/Taishō era girls' education (女子教育) and were promoted heavily by the state until Japan's defeat in WWII. Their reappearance post-1945 suggests a conservative pushback against new democratic freedoms or a deep-seated cultural expectation. |
| **姑の言** | The mother-in-law's words. In the pre-modern and early Showa family system (*ie* system), the daughter-in-law (嫁, *yome*) held the lowest status and was expected to endure extreme obedience and hardship under the mother-in-law (姑, *shūtome*). Submissive obedience was paramount. |
| **家をさる道 (家を治める道)** | The path to governing the house. In traditional Japan, the wife was responsible for managing all domestic affairs, finances, and servants, ensuring the smooth operation of the husband's lineage (the *ie*). This was considered a high-level administrative skill. |
| **國をたゝぬべからず** | "If the nation is not established from now." This hyper-nationalistic phrasing connects the successful raising of a virtuous daughter directly to the rebuilding and moral strength of the postwar Japanese nation (Showa context). A virtuous wife/mother is a patriotic act. |
| **歴史的仮名遣い** | The use of historical kana (e.g., とゝのへ, ゐる) signifies adherence to formal, pre-war standards of writing, reinforcing the didactic and conservative nature of the subject matter. |
| **つるがとく** | "Like a crane." Refers to the perceived elegance, loyalty, and dignity associated with the crane, used here as a standard of perfection in service or demeanor. |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Kanji/Kana) | Normalized Reading | Meaning / Nuance | Euphemism / Historical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| さはがしらぬ | *sawagashiranu* | Not knowing (or ignoring) noise/gossip/trouble. | Refers to maintaining discretion and ignoring potential scandal or criticism about one's self. |
| 身をきらふ | *mi o kirau* | To avoid/dislike one's body (in a public sense). | Euphemism for modesty, hygiene, and avoiding physical impurity or attracting unwanted attention. |
| 葉をついしみる | *ha o tsuishimiru* | To restrict/restrain one's words/speech. | Archaic/literary phrase meaning to be humble, silent, or extremely careful with verbal expression. (葉 here means "words/speech"). |
| 婦容 (フヨウ) | *fuyō* | Wifely Appearance/Demeanor. | One of the Four Virtues; relates to physical neatness, grooming, and posture. |
| 婦功 (フコウ) | *fukō* | Wifely Work/Achievement. | One of the Four Virtues; relates to domestic skills like weaving, cooking, and management. |
| 大徳 (タイトク) | *taitoku* | Great Virtue/Moral Power. | Refers to the high level of moral character achieved by successfully executing all domestic duties. |
| いさいか | *isai ka* (or *isasaka*) | Trivial matters; slightest failing. | Used to emphasize that no matter how small the task or error, the daughter must be diligent. |
| 嘉言 (ヨゴン) | *yogon* | Good words, praise, felicitous remarks. | Paired with its implied opposite (often 悪言, *akugen*), emphasizing the quality and intent behind one's speech. |

---

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

| Theme | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Patriarchal Control** | The text is a pure expression of patriarchy, defining female worth entirely through service (to the husband's family, the mother-in-law, the state) and external perfection (容, 功). The lack of independent agency is total. |
| **Shame and Honor** | The constant references to "name" (*na o omofu*) and avoiding the mother-in-law's criticism highlight shame culture. A wife's existence is validated only by the honor she reflects back onto her husband's lineage and, by extension, the nation. |
| **Voyeurism/Self-Scrutiny** | The focus on *Fuyō* (Appearance) and *mi o kirau* (avoiding discomfort when observed) suggests a world where the wife is perpetually under surveillance—by the mother-in-law, guests, the community, and ultimately, the daughter must internalize this gaze. |
| **Anxiety of Post-War Collapse**| The repeated exhortation that the "nation must be established" (*Kuni o tatanu bekarazu*) reveals a deep-seated anxiety common in the immediate postwar era. Traditionalists feared that the loss of state structure and the introduction of democratic/liberal concepts (especially for women) would lead to national moral degradation. The ideal wife is the foundation of national renewal. |
| **Kitan Club Irony** | Placing this extreme Confucian tract in an ero-guro publication like *Kitan Club* generates powerful subtext. It either functions as: 1) The standard that readers are gleefully transgressing against; 2) The moral framework that makes the transgression (secret perversion) exciting; or 3) A genuinely accepted moral standard that must be maintained externally, regardless of internal desires. |
