## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Title:**
Downfall's Sickly Leaves
Michie Suzuki

**Lead:**
A woman-drawn post-war-type daughter's trackless-ness (recklessness).
Even in Yasuko, who does not think of men as even "man-smelling," as a woman, a quiet reflection has begun to sprout.

**Body:**
Yasuko is the only daughter of a cosmetics shop that puts out quite a shop in Sennichimae. Being a precocious girl who already saw the female physiological phenomenon (menstruation) at age twelve, when in the second year of girls' school, she got too hot for a young teacher, caused an incident, and after dropping out midway, she was chased by conventional lessons like sewing, tea, and flowers; however, for her who was originally of a flighty nature, sitting quietly and behaving well was unbearable pain, and she often skipped for movies or playing with male friends.

At her house, they set up an indoor bath. One time, when she tried to enter, a friend of her father, an uncle over forty who was visiting, was soaking in the hot water feeling good. She thought "Oh," but she is not the kind of girl to hesitate.
"Excuse me,"
she said, and without even hiding her front, she walked right in, and the older man turned red and retreated quickly—"it was quite a pity," Yasuko told everyone while she was at sewing lessons to kill boredom.

In the spring of her twentieth year, she (fell in love) with the only son of an inn two blocks away, and they married in the autumn of that year.
He was a special attack (kamikaze) member, but the war ended just before departure; he saved his life by a hair's breadth, and after returning, he did broker-like things and loitered around. He likes sake, does gambling, is strong in fights and has never lost. Marriage to Hiroshi, who lives a nihilistic and decadent, elusive life of a twenty-year-old man who failed to die, had much of the blindness of one's twenties.
That the tomboyish Yasuko, who was flighty and drank and smoked, was a virgin was a great surprise to Hiroshi.
"Since you played around quite a bit, I (thought) you were 'gone' (not a virgin)..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Withered Leaves of Downfall**
By Michie Suzuki

*A portrait of the reckless abandon of a post-war girl, as seen through a woman's eyes. Even for Yasuko, a girl so jaded she hardly notices the "manliness" of men, the first quiet sprouts of feminine self-reflection have begun to take root.*

Yasuko was the only daughter of a prosperous cosmetics shop owner in Osaka’s Sennichimae district. Precocious from the start—she had begun her cycles at the age of twelve—she developed an obsessive infatuation with a young teacher during her second year of girls' school. The resulting scandal led to her expulsion. Afterward, she was pressured into the traditional ladylike arts of sewing, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement. But for a girl of her restless, flirtatious temperament, sitting still and playing the part of a proper lady was agonizing. She spent most of her time playing truant, escaping to the cinema or carousing with male friends.

Her family home was modern enough to have its own indoor bath. One day, Yasuko went to bathe only to find a friend of her father—a man in his forties—already soaking contentedly in the tub. A normal girl might have recoiled, but Yasuko wasn't one to be flustered.
"Mind if I join you?" she chirped. 
Without even bothering to cover herself, she stepped right in. The older man, face turning a deep crimson, beat a hasty retreat. Yasuko later recounted the tale during her sewing lessons just to pass the time, laughing about how "terribly sorry" she felt for the poor old man.

When she was twenty, she fell for the son of an innkeeper just two blocks away, and they were married by autumn. Her husband, Hiroshi, had been a member of a Kamikaze unit, spared only because the war ended moments before his scheduled sortie. Having missed his chance to die, he lived a hollow, decadent life, dabbling in shady brokerage work and drifting aimlessly. He drank, he gambled, and he was a formidable brawler who had never lost a fight. Yasuko’s decision to marry this elusive, nihilistic man was fueled largely by the reckless blindness of youth. 

Despite her reputation as a wild girl who drank, smoked, and flirted, Hiroshi was stunned to discover that Yasuko was a virgin. 
"You'd been around so much," he told her, "I just assumed you were... experienced."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography:** The page uses a classic vertical orientation (tate-gaki). The title is rendered in large, hand-brushed calligraphy style with furigana to ensure the specific reading of the kanji "病葉" (Wakuraba).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the most prominent element, followed by the author's name. A bold, two-line sub-header (lead) provides a "hook" for the reader. The text then wraps around a central illustration.
*   **Illustration:** The sketch has a gritty, realist style typical of mid-century Japanese magazines. It depicts a man (presumably Hiroshi) in a tank top sitting hunched over, while a woman (Yasuko) lies in the background looking up with a weary or cynical expression. The art emphasizes the "Sengoha" (post-war) aesthetic—disheveled, modern, and slightly bleak.
*   **Columns:** The text is divided into sections that navigate around the artwork, suggesting a dynamic, magazine-style layout rather than a formal book.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Sengoha (戦後派):** Literally the "Post-war Faction." This refers to a generation and a literary movement characterized by nihilism, a rejection of traditional morality, and a focus on the harsh realities of life after Japan's defeat in WWII. Yasuko is described as a "Sengoha girl"—bold, sexually liberated (at least in attitude), and unimpressed by authority.
*   **Sennichimae (千日前):** A famous entertainment district in Namba, Osaka. Mentioning this location immediately identifies the characters as city-dwellers, likely part of the "moba/moga" (modern boy/modern girl) lineage.
*   **Tokkōtai (特攻隊):** The Kamikaze pilots. Hiroshi's character is a classic trope of the era: the "survivor" who was prepared to die for the Emperor and now finds himself in a world where that sacrifice is meaningless. This "failed death" often led to the "decadence" (tai-hai) and "nihilism" mentioned in the text.
*   **Early 1950s Context:** The mention of "cosmetics shops," "indoor baths" (still a luxury for some), and the specific social friction between traditional "lessons" (sewing/tea) and the new "reckless" behavior points to the late 1940s or early 1950s.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Wakuraba (病葉):** Literally "sick leaf." It refers to a leaf that has turned color or withered due to disease before autumn. In literature, it is a metaphor for a young person who has become corrupted, sickly, or "fallen" before their time.
*   **Tenraku (転落):** Downfall or degradation. This was a popular theme in post-war literature (e.g., Dazai Osamu).
*   **Gomen-yasu (御免やす):** An Osaka-dialect (Kansai-ben) polite way of saying "Excuse me" or "I'm coming in." Its use here highlights Yasuko's casual, local character.
*   **Taihai (タイハイ / 退廃):** Decadence. A buzzword of the post-war era, describing the collapse of the old moral order and the pursuit of hedonism or apathy.
*   **Mukidou (無軌道):** Literally "trackless." Used to describe someone who is reckless, off the rails, or living without a set moral path.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Disillusionment of the Survivor:** Hiroshi represents the "lost generation" of Japanese men who survived the war but lost their purpose. His gambling and brawling are symptoms of his "kyomu" (nihilism).
*   **Female Agency vs. Reputation:** The story plays with the gap between Yasuko’s outward "reckless" behavior (smoking, drinking, entering a bath with a man) and her internal reality (she was still a virgin). It suggests that the "Sengoha" rebellion was often a performance of toughness or indifference.
*   **The Decay of Tradition:** The "typical lessons" of sewing and tea ceremony are described as "burdensome" or "boring," showing the shift in values among young women of the period.
*   **Domestic Nihilism:** The marriage isn't described as a romantic triumph but as a result of "blindness" and a shared sense of being "lost."

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction / Short Story (likely a "Kasutori" or popular literary magazine entry).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Sengoha, Nihilism, Gender Roles, Marriage, Decadence, Osaka culture.
*   **Classification:** Social Realism / Pulp Fiction.
