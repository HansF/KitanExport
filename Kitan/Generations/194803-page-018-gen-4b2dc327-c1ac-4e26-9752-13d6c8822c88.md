...because [it] stabbed over and over, repeatedly, even Yoshiko, as expected, shed tears and asked for [him] to forgive [her], but "This is what you did," [he] said and until the end did not forgive [her]. Yoshiko was thus completely avenged by [her] husband.

**The 15-year-old Girl Who Committed Suicide**
**Akira Asakawa**

Keiko was, from elementary school times, during gymnastics time when lining up, a large-statured child to the extent of lining up at the far right end.
Upon graduating, immediately, because it was decided she would commute to a nearby factory, it might be thought that she became even more precocious, but having just reached the counting age of fifteen, already her waistline etc. had matured into a full-grown girl.
In the house, there were aged parents and two younger sisters, and with only the money the father earned, it was not at all enough for living expenses, so the roughly 1,000 yen money she brought home monthly was a precious thing.
It was Sunday. She went out to the market for shopping during a long-awaited break.
On a clear, pleasant day, in the vacant lot facing the street after leaving the alley in front of the house, the members of the Toyo Rubber Co., Ltd. baseball club were practicing.
The back net was fluttering "hata-hata" in the autumn wind. She, while holding her shopping basket, mixed in with the spectators and was watching by the side of the net.
People leaning on bicycles also gathered in large numbers, pleasantly watching the vivid play being performed in sheet knock (fielding practice).
Saying they would appear in a match soon, everyone was high-spirited and it was just the period of the best condition.
Keiko also worked at the same Toyo Rubber, so she remembered all the players' faces and was watching with particular nostalgia.
During break times, she often saw them playing catch in the athletic field where gas-gara (clinkers) were spread inside the factory, but seeing them practicing all together like this was the first time.
The captain, Hayakawa, stood in the batter's box. While giving various orders for the balls the friendly pitcher threw, the ball hit with a "kaan" resounded pleasantly in the blue sky and flew largely to the outfield.
Keiko also watched the white ball drawing a beautiful curve and being sucked into the outfielder's glove.
Kaan, kaan, every time he hit, it flew in various forms like grounders and fly balls to the right and left.
It was when he had hit about ten times.
Coming in a large curve to the outside, he hooked the speedball.
"Ah!"
The ball that grazed the surface of the bat and tipped, fouled off at a sharp angle and jumped into the crowd of spectators.
Everyone dodged unconsciously, but unfortunately, that foul ball hit Keiko's chest.
Because the sun that had just begun to set was shining "gira-gira" (glaringly) directly in front, she could not even aim to dodge her body.
While hugging her shopping basket, Keiko collapsed on the spot like "kuta-".
"Where did it hit?"
Hayakawa, who hit it, came flying and took her hand.
Spectators formed a circle surrounding her and Hayakawa. The ball had hit her left chest. Practice was temporarily suspended.
From the fact that they said they worked at the same company, someone who knew her house helped, and two people including Hayakawa carried her back.
Because the daughter who went shopping returned carried by two men, the mother was surprised, but felt relieved hearing they were people working at the same factory.
Baseball practice continued to be held, but only Hayakawa immediately went to call the factory's part-time doctor who lived nearby and had him come.
Being told to put a wet compress on the chest and keep quiet, it probably wouldn't be a big deal; usually her body was on the sturdy side, and if they took care not to even become worried, it was that there was nothing to worry about.
Hayakawa stayed by her bedside, spreading extract (medicine) on cloth pieces, cooling her head, and nursing her devotedly.
Perhaps she ran a slight fever; her cheeks took on a flush.
"Really, I'm sorry for causing trouble, just because I was in such a place..."
"No, I was the one who was bad. Since there were many spectators, I should have hit with more caution. It must have hurt, right?"
He, who was the Youth Division Chief of the company's labor union, apologized in a brisk tone.
Eventually, the father also returned, so after apologizing in various ways again, he returned.
The next morning, on the way to the factory, he stopped by for a moment to ask about Keiko's condition, and feeling relieved, he came up to Keiko's room on the second floor that evening carrying a fruit basket for a visit.
For a time, she seemed to have a fever from the shock of the ball hitting her chest, but by evening she had completely recovered her energy and was able to sit on the bed in her nightwear.
Even though she was fifteen, a person who did not know her true age might see her as over twenty because she was exceptionally large-statured. Hayakawa, who had been demobilized and returned to his original factory and was still living a single life in a boarding house, faced her in her nightwear as if looking at something dazzling.
"Have you become energetic already?"
"Yes, thank you for coming many times. Thanks to you, I'm already completely fine. I'm thinking I can go to the factory from tomorrow."
"Is that so? That's wonderful. When you collapsed 'kuta-', my heart thumped and I was worried for a moment what would happen. I'm glad you got well quickly. The guys outside also said to give their regards."
"Truly, for causing you so much worry..."
She, fiddling with the edge of the futon with her fingertips, looked at his face with a sidelong glance.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Fifteen-Year-Old Girl Who Took Her Own Life**
By Akira Asakawa

Ever since her elementary school days, Keiko had been a girl of unusually large stature; whenever they lined up for gymnastics, she was always the one standing at the far right end of the row. After graduation, she immediately began working at a local factory, which perhaps contributed to her precocious air. Though she had only just turned fifteen by the traditional count, the curves of her waist already suggested the maturity of a grown woman. She lived with her aging parents and two younger sisters. Her father’s earnings alone were far from enough to cover the family’s expenses, making the thousand yen or so she brought home each month a vital contribution.

It was a Sunday, and Keiko had gone out to the market on a rare day off. It was a clear, beautiful day. In the vacant lot facing the main road just outside her alley, the baseball team from the Toyo Rubber Company was practicing. The backstop net fluttered in the autumn breeze. Clutching her shopping basket, Keiko joined the small crowd of spectators gathered by the side of the net. Men leaning on their bicycles watched with approval as the players executed sharp, vivid movements during fielding drills. With a game approaching, the whole team was in high spirits, currently in peak physical condition.

Working at the same company, Keiko recognized all the players' faces, which lent a certain warmth to her gaze. While she often saw them playing catch during lunch breaks on the factory’s cinder-strewn grounds, this was the first time she had seen them all practicing together in such an organized fashion.

Hayakawa, the team captain, stepped into the batter's box. He called out instructions to the pitcher, and with a sharp *crack*, he sent a ball sailing into the clear blue sky toward the outfield. Keiko watched as the white ball traced a beautiful arc before being swallowed by an outfielder's glove. *Crack, crack*—with every swing, the ball flew in different directions: grounders to the right, flies to the left.

He had taken about ten swings when it happened. Hayakawa hooked a high-speed curveball on the outside corner.

"Look out!"

The ball grazed the surface of the bat and chipped off at a sharp angle, screaming into the crowd of spectators as a foul tip. Everyone instinctively dove out of the way, but by some misfortune, the ball struck Keiko square in the chest. The late afternoon sun was glaring directly into her eyes, leaving her no chance to dodge. Still clutching her shopping basket, Keiko collapsed to the ground in a heap.

"Where did it hit you?" Hayakawa cried, rushing over and taking her hand. A circle of spectators formed around them. The ball had struck the left side of her chest. Practice was immediately halted. When it was discovered they worked for the same company, someone who knew where she lived helped Hayakawa carry her home.

Her mother was shocked to see her daughter being carried home by two men, but her heart settled when she learned they were coworkers from the factory. While the rest of the team resumed practice, Hayakawa went to fetch the factory's physician who lived nearby. The doctor advised a wet compress and rest, suggesting it wasn't a serious injury. Since Keiko was generally healthy and strong, he assured them there was no cause for alarm as long as she stayed quiet.

Hayakawa remained by her bedside, diligently tending to her by applying medicinal extracts to bandages and cooling her brow. A slight fever seemed to have taken hold, and her cheeks were flushed.

"I’m so sorry for the trouble," Keiko murmured. "If only I hadn't been standing there..."

"No, it was my fault," Hayakawa replied in the brisk, clear tone of the union's youth leader. "I knew there were spectators; I should have been more careful with my swing. It must have been so painful."

When her father finally returned, Hayakawa apologized once more before taking his leave. The following morning, he stopped by briefly on his way to work to check on her. Relieved by her progress, he returned that evening with a gift basket of fruit and went up to her room on the second floor.

Though the shock of the impact had initially caused a fever, by evening she had recovered enough to sit up in bed, though still in her nightwear. Though only fifteen, her tall frame might have led a stranger to mistake her for someone in her twenties. Hayakawa—a veteran who had returned to the factory after the war and was living a lonely bachelor’s life in a boarding house—found the sight of her in her nightgown almost dazzling.

"Are you feeling better now?"

"Yes, thank you for coming so often. I’m quite alright now, thanks to you. I think I’ll be back at the factory tomorrow."

"I'm glad to hear it. When I saw you collapse like that, my heart nearly stopped. I was so worried about what might happen. I'm just glad you've recovered so quickly. The rest of the guys wanted me to give you their best."

"Truly, you’ve been so kind..."

Fiddling with the edge of her quilt, Keiko looked up at him with a shy, sidelong glance.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a standard Japanese vertical orientation (*tategaki*). It uses a two-column structure typical of magazines or journals of the mid-20th century.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho style. The main title is bolded and centered at the top of the article. There is a small horizontal line separating the end of a previous story (top right) from the start of the new one.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "自殺した十五の娘" (The 15-year-old girl who committed suicide) is the largest text element. The author's name, "淺川 暁" (Akira Asakawa), is slightly smaller and centered below the title.
*   **Page Numbering:** The number "- 18 -" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a longer publication.
*   **Condition:** The paper shows signs of aging (browning and foxing), common for pulp magazines from the Showa era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Japan):** The mention of "Toyo Rubber Co., Ltd." (now Toyo Tire) and the character Hayakawa being "demobilized" (*fukuin*) places this story firmly in the post-WWII period (late 1940s to early 1950s).
*   **Labor and Poverty:** The family's reliance on a 15-year-old girl's factory wages (1,000 yen) highlights the economic hardships of the era. Child labor (or young teenagers working) was common as families struggled to rebuild.
*   **Labor Unions:** The mention of Hayakawa being the "Youth Division Chief of the Labor Union" reflects the rise and prominence of labor unions in post-war Japan under the US occupation's democratization policies.
*   **Counting Age (*Kazue-doshi*):** The text mentions "数え年十五" (15 years old by traditional count). In this system, a child is one year old at birth and turns a year older every New Year's Day. This means her actual "Western" age might have been 13 or 14.
*   **Social Morality:** The ending, where the man finds the girl "dazzling" in her nightwear, hints at a romantic subplot. In the context of the title, this innocent beginning likely serves as a tragic contrast to her eventual suicide.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **大柄 (Oogara):** Large-statured. The text emphasizes her physical maturity as a contrast to her chronological age.
*   **復員 (Fukuin):** Demobilization. Specifically refers to soldiers returning from the front lines after WWII.
*   **嘱託醫 (Shokutaku-i):** A part-time or contract physician, often hired by factories to look after workers.
*   **ガスガラ (Gasu-gara):** Coal clinkers or cinders. These were often used to pave factory yards or athletic fields.
*   **シートノック (Shiito nokku):** A Japanese baseball term (from "sheet" + "knock") referring to infield/outfield fungo drills before a game.
*   **流し目 (Nagashime):** A sidelong glance, often implying coyness, flirtation, or a hidden emotion.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Tragedy vs. Mundanity:** The title is jarringly dark ("The girl who committed suicide"), yet the narrative on this page is almost pastoral and romantic—a girl watching baseball, an accidental injury leading to a meeting with a kind man. The subtext suggests that the trauma or the relationship starting here might eventually lead to the tragedy implied by the title.
*   **Physical Maturity vs. Social Vulnerability:** Keiko is physically "adult-like" but socially a child worker burdened with supporting her family. This creates a tension regarding her agency and the pressures placed upon her.
*   **Post-War Recovery:** The backdrop of the baseball game and the factory represents the "energetic" side of post-war recovery, while the family's poverty represents the lingering struggle.
