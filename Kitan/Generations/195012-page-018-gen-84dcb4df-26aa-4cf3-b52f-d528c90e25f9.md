「なにもないんだ、もう何時だ……」
「また時間を気になさるのね……時間なんかどうだつていゝぢやないの、早くすませなけりや、明朝、眼があかないわ」
「うん」
「まるで お義理のようね、……あらッ あなたどうしたの、また起きたりなんかして……」
　艶子は不平そうに言いながら、ぢっと夫の顔をみつめた。
「お驚きにならなくてもいゝのよ、いまのは汽車の響きぢやないの、毎晩きいていて、もう馴れつこになつているはずよ、押入のふすまなんか眠らんでいて、変だわ、おかしいわ……、あゝそうだわ、あなたッて方、あたし以外に関係のあつたひとがあつたのね、その幻影におびやかされ、良心のいかしゃくに苦しんでいらつしゃるのね、見損つたわ、あたし実家へ帰るわ」
「あゝ、判つた、やれやれ、ようよう判つた」
　ほつとしたように明るく言つた。
「あなた、それなに？」
　夫の明るさに、艶子は涙の顔をあげた。
「艶子、この家は化物屋敷なんだよ、お化けが出るんだよ」
「あなた、それほんとう、こわいわ」
　艶子はぱつと夫にしがみついた。
「うん、今日ね床屋へ行つただろう、するとね、待合せていた人が、あすこの若夫婦も、いまに恐れをなして逃げるだろう、誰だつて化物屋敷なんて気味が悪いからね、と話しているんだ 僕は最初のうちはどこのことかと思つていたんだが、聞いていると僕たちのことを言つているんだ、いやだつたね」
「まあッ、あなた、なにが出るんでしょう、こわいわ、しつかり抱いてよ……なにが出るのでしょう……」
「夜中に押入のふすまが音もなくすうつと開くんだよ、それごらん、あのふすま二寸ばかり開いているだろ、さいぜん、ふすまが開くのを僕は見ていたんだ」
「あちッ、きつちり閉めたはずなのに開いているわ、あゝこわ、あなたもつとしつかり抱いてよ」
「そう、ふるえるなよ」
「そんなに、落着いてはいられないわ明日は早速引越ししましょう、こわい、こわい、どうしようかしら、今日一夜が過せないわ」
「そうふるえるなよ、いまに化物の正体を僕が見せてやるよ」
　艶子の饒舌（じようぜつ）はすつかり納つて、恐怖におののいているばかり。
「立つちやいや、あたしのそばを離れちやいや、というのに、あなたッ」
「やかましく言うなよ、ふすまを閉めなけりや、お化けの正体が見られないんだよ」
　艶子は夫の腕のなかで、恐怖に躰（からだ）を固くしてしまつた。
「ほれ、艶子、見てごらん、いまに開くよ、もうすぐ開くよ」
　遠くから聞えてくる汽車の響が蒼白い化物の出る、前奏曲のような気がする。
「いま開くよ、見るんだよ、それ開いた、ほんとうだろう」
「ほんとだわ、こわいわ、あなたどうしましょう」
「どうもしないよ、化物の正体は、説明をするよ、これは汽車の悪戯（いたずら）だよ、この辺は地盤の関係で、汽車が通る度に家が揺れるんだ、それなんだよ、そこへ押入の敷居が少し傾いているんだね、汽車の震動で、ふすまがちよつとをすべるんだ、ただそれだけだよ 幽霊（ゆうれい）の正体見たり枯尾花なんてのもないことだ」
「それほんとう、なんだかまだ、こわいわ」
「納得がいかぬのだったら次の汽車が通るまで、待つてもいゝ……」
「ぢやあ、ほんとうね……」
　艶子の饒舌はすつかりは頼母（たのも）しいやつぱりあなたは頼母しいわ」
　艶子は抱かれたまま夫の懐（ふところ）へ手を入れて赤児（あかご）のように甘えた。
「あなたッ、でもまだとくいんのいかないことがあるの……」
「なんだい……」
「いじわる、知つているくせに、ひどいわ、ひどいわ」

「あゝそうか……」
　息ずまるような長いキッスが終つたとたん、艶子の手によつて、明々としていた電燈が、ベツトルーム、ランプにきりかえられた。

「あなたッ、でもまだ納得のいかないことがあるの……」
「なんだい……」
「いじわる、知っているくせに。ひどいわ、ひどいわ」

「ああ、そうか……」
　息詰まるような長いキスが終わった途端、艶子の手によって、こうこうとしていた電灯が、ベッドルーム・ランプに切り替えられた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"It is nothing, what time is it now..."
"Again you are worrying about the time... time and such, doesn't it not matter, if [we] don't finish quickly, tomorrow morning, eyes won't open."
"Yeah."
"It's just like a formality/duty, isn't it... Oh! You, what happened, getting up again and such..."
Tsuyako, while speaking as if complaining, intently stared at her husband's face.
"No need to be surprised. That just now was the sound of a train, wasn't it. Listening every night, you should be used to it by now. The closet sliding door and such, while not sleeping, it's strange, it's odd... Ah, that's it, you person, besides me there was someone you had a relationship with, weren't there. Threatened by that phantom, you are suffering from the pangs of conscience, aren't you. I'm disappointed, I'm going back to my parents' home."
"Ah, I understand. My, my, finally I understand."
[He] said brightly as if relieved.
"You, what is that?"
At the husband's brightness, Tsuyako raised her tearful face.
"Tsuyako, this house is a monster-house (haunted house). Ghosts come out."
"You, is that true, it's scary."
Tsuyako suddenly clung to her husband.
"Yeah, today I went to the barber, right. Then, a person who was waiting [said], 'That young couple over there, soon they will fear and flee, because anyone would find a haunted house creepy,' they were talking. I at first thought where are they talking about, but listening, they were talking about us. It was unpleasant."
"My! You, what comes out? I'm scared, hold me tight... what comes out..."
"In the middle of the night, the closet sliding door without a sound slides open. Look at that, that door is open about two inches. Just now, I was watching the door open."
"Oh! It should have been tightly closed, but it's open. Ah, scary, you hold me more tightly."
"Yes, don't tremble."
"In such a state, I cannot be calm. Tomorrow let's move immediately. Scary, scary, what shall I do, I cannot pass this one night."
"Don't tremble so. Soon, the ghost's true identity, I will show you."
Tsuyako's talkativeness completely stopped, she was only trembling with fear.
"Don't stand up, don't leave my side, I'm saying, you!"
"Don't be so noisy. If I don't close the door, the ghost's true identity cannot be seen."
Tsuyako, in her husband's arms, hardened her body with fear.
"Look, Tsuyako, try looking. Soon it will open. It will open very soon."
The sound of a train coming from afar feels like a prelude to a pale monster appearing.
"Now it opens, look. There, it opened. It's true, isn't it."
"It's true, it's scary, you, what shall we do."
"I'll do nothing. The ghost's true identity, I will explain. This is a prank of the train. Around here, due to the ground, every time a train passes the house shakes. That's it. And there, the closet threshold is slightly tilted. With the train's vibration, the door slides a bit. It's just that. 'Seeing the ghost's true identity, it was withered pampas grass'—it's nothing like that."
"Is that true? Somehow it's still scary."
"If you aren't convinced, until the next train passes, we can wait..."
"Then, it's true..."
Tsuyako's talkativeness [turned to] "After all, you are reliable."
Tsuyako, while being held, put her hand into her husband's chest and acted spoiled like a baby.
"You! But there is still something I'm not convinced about..."
"What is it..."
"Mean person, even though you know. You're mean, you're mean."

"Ah, I see..."
The moment a breathtakingly long kiss ended, by Tsuyako's hand, the brightly lit electric light was switched to the bedroom lamp.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"It’s nothing. What time is it?"
"Obsessing over the time again... Does the time even matter? If we don't finish up soon, we won't be able to keep our eyes open tomorrow morning."
"I suppose."
"It’s like you're just doing a chore... Wait, what’s wrong? Why are you getting up again?"
Tsuyako stared fixedly at her husband's face, her voice tinged with dissatisfaction.
"There's no need to be startled. That was just the sound of the train. You hear it every night; you should be used to it by now. But that closet door... I've been lying here awake, and it's just so strange. Oh, I see! You had someone else before me, didn't you? You're being haunted by her ghost, suffering the stings of a guilty conscience. I'm so disappointed in you. I’m going back to my parents!"
"Ah, I see! Good grief, I finally understand!" he exclaimed, his voice suddenly bright with relief.
"What is it?" Tsuyako looked up, her face stained with tears, confused by his sudden change in mood.
"Tsuyako, this house is haunted. A ghost is appearing."
"Is that... is that true? I'm scared!" She lunged at him, clinging tightly.
"Yeah. I went to the barber today, and the men waiting there were saying, 'That young couple in that house will be running away in terror soon enough. No one wants to live in a creepy haunted house.' At first, I wondered which house they meant, but then I realized they were talking about us. It was quite upsetting."
"Oh, heavens! What kind of ghost is it? I'm terrified—hold me tight! What on earth is appearing?"
"In the middle of the night, the closet door slides open all by itself, without a sound. Look there—it’s open about two inches already. I was just watching it slide open a moment ago."
"Eek! I’m sure I closed it tight, but it’s open! Oh, it's so scary! Hold me tighter!"
"There, now. Don't tremble so much."
"How can I be calm? We’re moving first thing tomorrow! I'm so scared... what are we going to do? I can't spend another night here!"
"Stop shaking. I'm going to show you the ghost's true identity right now."
Tsuyako’s frantic chatter died away, replaced by a silent, shivering dread.
"Don't stand up! Don't you dare leave my side! I mean it!"
"Hush now. If I don't close the door again, we won't be able to catch the ghost in the act."
Cradled in her husband's arms, Tsuyako’s entire body went rigid with fear.
"Look, Tsuyako. Watch closely. It’s going to open soon. Any second now..."
The rumble of a distant train sounded like the ominous overture to the appearance of a pale apparition.
"It’s opening... watch... see? It opened! Didn't it?"
"It did! It really did! Oh, it’s terrifying! What do we do?"
"We don't do anything. I'll explain the 'ghost' to you. It's just a trick played by the train. The ground around here is soft, so the house shakes every time a train passes. That’s all it is. Plus, the track for the closet door is slightly slanted. The vibration makes the door slide open just a bit. That's the whole mystery. It’s just like the old saying: 'The ghost you saw was but withered grass.'"
"Is that really true? I'm... I'm still a little scared."
"If you don't believe me, we can wait right here until the next train passes."
"Then... it really is true..."
Tsuyako’s nervous energy vanished. "You really are dependable, after all."
Still held in his arms, she tucked her hand into the front of his robe and snuggled against him like a child.
"Wait... there's still one thing I'm not satisfied with..."
"And what's that?"
"You're so mean... you know exactly what I mean. You're just being cruel!"

"Ah, I see..."
The moment their breathless, lingering kiss ended, Tsuyako reached out and switched the bright overhead light to the soft glow of the bedside lamp.
--THE END--

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in traditional Japanese vertical columns (tategaki), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** It uses a standard Ming-style (Mincho) typeface common in mid-century printing. Some kanji are accompanied by *furigana* (ruby characters) to assist with reading less common words like 饒舌 (loquacity), 躰 (body), and 懐 (bosom).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The story is presented as a continuous narrative with indentation marking new paragraphs. A small illustration at the bottom depicts the climax/resolution: a man in a yukata or robe holding a woman close, reinforcing the romantic/domestic theme.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses modern Japanese punctuation (commas, periods, quotation marks) but includes some archaic or stylistic flourishes like the double dash (ーー) to signify the end of the story. The use of "ッ" (small tsu) at the end of exclamations is a notable feature of conversational prose from this era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Showa 20s-30s):** The mention of a "kiss" (キッス) as a dramatic finale suggests the post-WWII era. Before the war, depictions of kissing were rare and often censored; the "kiss scene" became a symbol of Westernized romance and "New Japan" in the late 1940s.
*   **Housing & Infrastructure:** The setting involves a house built near railroad tracks on perhaps unstable ground—a common reality in rapidly rebuilding post-war urban areas. The "monster house" (obake-yashiki) trope was a common theme in folk-tales and popular gossip.
*   **Gender Roles:** The dialogue reflects traditional gender dynamics of the time: the wife (Tsuyako) is depicted as emotional, superstitious, and suspicious of her husband's fidelity, while the husband is the logical "protector" who solves the mystery and provides "dependability" (tanomoshii).
*   **Linguistic Shifts:** The text uses "いゝ" instead of "いい," and "ぢゃ" instead of "じゃ," which were common orthographic habits transitioning from the old kana usage to modern standards.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **お義理 (O-giri):** Usually means duty or social obligation. Here, Tsuyako suggests her husband is being intimate with her out of "duty" rather than passion.
*   **饒舌 (Jōzetsu):** Loquacity or talkativeness. It highlights Tsuyako's nervous chattering.
*   **幽霊の正体見たり枯尾花 (Yūrei no shōtai mitari kareobana):** A famous Japanese proverb meaning "Once you see the ghost's true identity, it’s just withered pampas grass." It refers to how fear can make ordinary things look terrifying.
*   **見損った (Misonotta):** To misjudge someone's character or be disappointed in them.
*   **頼母しい (Tanomoshii):** Reliable, dependable, or trustworthy. This represents the husband's validation in the eyes of his wife.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Logic vs. Superstition:** The story follows a classic "Scooby-Doo" type arc where a supernatural phenomenon is debunked by scientific explanation (vibration and gravity).
*   **Domestic Suspicion:** The initial conflict is not the ghost, but Tsuyako's suspicion that her husband is thinking of another woman ("phantom" of a past lover). The "ghost" provides a redirection of her anxiety.
*   **Intimacy and Reconciliation:** The resolution of the "mystery" serves as an aphrodisiac. The fear brings the couple physically closer (clinging), and the relief leads to a romantic embrace and a "breathless kiss."
*   **The Modern Couple:** The use of "Bedroom Lamp" (ベツトルーム、ランプ) and "Kiss" (キッス) points to a desire for a modern, Westernized lifestyle among readers of the period.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story (Tanpen), Domestic Drama.
*   **Themes:** Romance, Mystery/Suspense, Rationalism, Post-war Life, Marriage.
