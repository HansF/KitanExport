...で當子を殺せるんだ！」
「しかし、君でないとすると、他に男は佐崎君より居ない事になるが……」
「俺は友達を疑いたくないが、さっきこの家に引返して來た時に殺したのだらうと思ふ！」
　西山は向もそう言張つた。
「しかし、そうだとすると被害者はそれまで裸でいたのかな？もう電燈も點いてるし、そんな事は考へられんが、婆さん、貴女が最初こゝを見付けた時の様子はどうでした？」
「私は又誰かが裏の梯子を昇つて行くので、誰だらうと思つて二階へ來たんですが、その時にはこの男の人がおろおろして室の入口に立つていましたし、女給さんはもう裸になつて死んでいましたよ」
「ふむ、その直前に何か物音を聞かなかつたかね？」
「いゝえ別に――私にやよく分りませんがね、この男の人が着物を脱がせたり首を絞めたりしたのぢやないかと思いますよ、何故つてね、足音を聞いて私やすぐ二階へ来たんですからね、とてもそれだけの間にこの女給さんを裸にしたり悪戯をしたりなんか出来ませんよ、始めつから裸になつていたとしても、十分やそこらはかゝりますものねぇ旦那」
　刑事は具体的過ぎた説明に一寸煎れた顔になつたが、とにかく新月の婆さんの説明は充分頷けた。何にしても、この犯人は男であり、佐崎か西山かのどちらかである事だけは明白、後は汚液を鑑識して、二人の血液型さえ調べれば、犯人は科學が見付けてくれる筈である。刑事は一應調査を打切つて、佐崎、西山兩君を嫌疑者として警察へ連行して行つた。

（五）
　佐崎君の血型は A、西山君は O型だつたが、二人共血液を取られる時には、犯人は絕對僕ちやないぞと進んで採血を願つた程だつた。すぐ鑑識課の方で汚液の分析が行われている間に、晴子は刑事室にまだ残つていて、主任刑事と何か話し合つていた。
「ねえ、私考えたんですけれど、どうも少しヘンだとお思いになりません？」
「何が？」
「何がつて、あの二人の嫌疑者。私何だか二人共犯人ぢやないように思うの。でも、西山さんは自分が結婚しようと決心した昔の恋人でしょう。全然殺人の動機が成立たないわ。それに佐崎さんに至つては全く初めて會つた女給だもの、益々動機薄弱だと思いまわ」
「動機的には一應そうとも考えられない事もないね……」
「それに佐崎さんは一番に新月を歸つていますから、殺人は不可能ですよ。そして又二度目に様子を見に來た時にも、新月の小母さんが言つたように、一二分で二度目に女を姦淫する事が出来ないなら、これも時間的に不合理です」
「それなら一体君は誰だと言うんだね、他に男は居ないぢやないか」
「まあ待つて頂戴よ。だからですねそこに何か重大な事を見逃していたか、飛んでもないカラクリがあつたか、或は私らの知らない第三者の犯人が居たか、解答はこの三つより出て來ないと思うの、そこで私にはこんな問題はよく分らないんですけれど、一つ露骨な事をお尋ねしても構いませんか？それはね、男の人つて續いて二度も×××××出来るものですか？」
「はゝゝゝ、これは嬢さんには惨酷な課題だね、まあかなり精力家なら前の時から十分間位間隔を置けば、連續二度淫は不可能ぢやないね、しかし飲酒していたりすると、その間隔はもつと長くなるのが普通だろう、何なら君を試験台に僕が實驗してもいいがね」
「嫌らしい主任さんねえ、もう一つそれぢやヘンな事尋ねますけれど……」
「晴子嬢すつかり辟易の態だね、何なら君も一度位は君の戀人と経験しておく事だな」
「嫌な人！冗談ぢやなくて眞剣なのよ。そうでなきゃ男の人にこんな質問なんかとてもしようとしませんわ」
「何だ、言つて御覧。僕で知つてる事なら何でも教えてあげる」
「あのネ、あのね……二度目の時にでもあれはあんなに沢山出るものでしようか」
「うむ――そんなに顔を隠さんでもええ」
「西山さんにしても佐崎さんにしても二度目なんです。それに二人共お酒を飲んでいます。その場合あんなに沢山分泌されるものでしようか。又、あんなに沢山外部にこぼれてしまうものでしようか？」
「うむ、成程、それは大いに疑問だね、確かに不自然な点もあるが、しかし又處女の君が、大變な所へ着眼したものだな」
「又そんな事仰言る。羞しいからからかつちや嫌。でも、私はこゝに重大な鍵が隠されていると思いますの」
　刑事は奇妙な顔をして暫く考えていたが、
「分つた！これは首を絞めた奴と、富子さんを犯した奴とは別人だつたんだ」
と突然に叫んだ。
「皆が歸る時に彼女は首を絞められた。その時は電燈が消えていたから誰がやつたのか分らない。その後へ誰かがやつて來て、裸のまゝの彼女を見て情慾を起し、獣行を遂げたのだ、ね、そうだろ？」
「私の考えている事とまだ違うわ、私はもつと他の事を考えてるの」
「名探偵青空晴子嬢の素晴らしい推理だね、煙草一本どうだ。百万国つけてもまだ賣れない不味い事請合の『新生』」
「アタシ、喫めませんの」
　そんな事を言つている時、警察醫の町田さんが検査結果の報告に入つ

「……で富子を殺せるんだ！」

「俺は友達を疑いたくないが、さっきこの家に引き返して来た時に殺したのだろうと思う！」

「しかし、そうだとすると被害者はそれまで裸でいたのかな？　もう電灯も点いてるし、そんな事は考えられんが、婆さん、あなたが最初ここを見つけた時の様子はどうでした？」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"...so [one] can kill Tomiko!"
"However, if it is not you, besides [there is] no man other than Sazaki-kun, it becomes the case, but..."
"I do not want to suspect a friend, but when [I] returned to this house a while ago, [I] think he killed [her]!"
Nishiyama still thus insisted.
"But, if it is so, was the victim until then naked? Already electric lights are also on, such a thing is not thinkable, but, old woman, you, when [you] first found here, how was the state?"
"I, again someone the back ladder climbed up [I saw], so thinking 'who is it?' I came to the second floor, but at that time this man was flustered and stood at the room entrance, and the waitress was already naked and dead."
"Hmm, just before that, something sound [did you] not hear?"
"No, not particularly—for me it is not well known, but I do not think this man made [her] take off clothes or strangled [her], because, hearing footsteps I immediately came to the second floor, so in just that interval to make this waitress naked or do mischief is not possible, even if from the start [she] was naked, ten minutes or so it takes, right, Master?"
The detective, at the too-concrete explanation, became a bit of a sour face, but anyway the explanation of the old woman of "Shingetsu" was sufficiently nodding-worthy. In any case, this culprit is a man, and only the fact that it is either Sazaki or Nishiyama is clear. Afterwards, examining the foul liquid (semen), if [we] check even the blood types of the two, the culprit should be science finding [him]. The detective for the time being ended the investigation and took Sazaki and Nishiyama both as suspects to the police station.

(Five)
Sazaki-kun's blood type was A, Nishiyama-kun was O type, but when both had blood taken, to the extent of [saying] "the culprit is definitely not me" and stepping forward to request blood sampling it was. While immediately in the forensics department analysis of the foul liquid was being done, Haruko still remained in the detective room and was discussing something with the chief detective.
"Say, I thought [about it], but doesn't it seem a bit strange to you?"
"What?"
"What [I mean] is, those two suspects. I somehow think both are not the culprit. But, Nishiyama-san is the old lover who decided to marry [her]. A murder motive absolutely does not stand. In Sazaki-san's case, [she] is a waitress he met for the first time, more and more the motive is weak, I think."
"Motive-wise, for the time being that cannot be un-thought of either..."
"Besides, Sazaki-san left Shingetsu first, so murder is impossible. And when he came to see the state a second time, as the auntie of Shingetsu said, if in one or two minutes [he] cannot rape the woman a second time, this also is time-wise unreasonable."
"Then who on earth do you say it is? Besides them no man is there, isn't there?"
"Well wait a moment. That is why, there, did [we] overlook something significant, was there an outrageous trick, or was there a third-party culprit unknown to us? The answer from these three [I] think does not come out. So for me such a problem is not well known, but one blunt thing may I ask? That is, can men consecutively two times ××××× (ejaculate)?"
"Hahaha, this is for a young lady a cruel task. Well, if quite a vigorous man, if [he] leaves about a ten-minute interval from the previous time, consecutive two-times lust (intercourse) is not impossible. But when drinking, that interval usually becomes longer. If you like, with you as a test stand, I can experiment, though."
"Nasty Chief, isn't it? One more then, I will ask a strange thing..."
"Miss Haruko is in a state of being completely fed up. If you like, you too at least once should experience it with your lover."
"Hateful person! It is not a joke, I am serious. Otherwise to a man such a question I would never try to do."
"What, try saying it. If it is a thing I know, I will tell you anything."
"Um, you know... even at the second time, does that come out in such a large amount?"
"Hmm—even without hiding your face thus [it's] fine."
"For Nishiyama-san and for Sazaki-san, it is the second time. Besides, both are drinking alcohol. In 그 case is such a large amount secreted? Also, would such a large amount spill outside?"
"Hmm, indeed, that is a great doubt. Certainly there are unnatural points, but still, for a virgin like you, you have fixed your eyes on a significant point."
"Again saying such things. Because it is embarrassing, teasing is hate. But I think a significant key is hidden here."
The detective made a strange face and for a while was thinking, but:
"I got it! This [means] the guy who strangled and the guy who violated Tomiko-san were different people!"
he suddenly shouted.
"When everyone was leaving, she was strangled. At that time electric lights were off so who did it is not known. After that someone came, saw her as she was naked and felt lust, and accomplished the bestial act, right, isn't it so?"
"It is still different from what I am thinking. I am thinking more of other things."
"Great detective Haruko Aozora's wonderful reasoning. How about one cigarette? Guaranteed to be a bad-tasting thing that even with a million koku [of rice] attached cannot be sold: 'Shinsei'."
"Me, I cannot smoke."
While saying such things, the police doctor Machida-san for the report of the examination results entered...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"...and that's how Tomiko was killed!"
"But if it wasn't you," the detective countered, "then Sazaki is the only man left."
"I don't want to doubt my friend," Nishiyama insisted, "but I think he killed her when he came back to this house earlier!"
"If that's the case, though," the detective mused, "would the victim have stayed naked that whole time? The lights were on, so it seems unlikely. Tell me, Ma'am, what did you see when you first found her?"
The old woman from the Shingetsu bar spoke up. "I saw someone climbing the back ladder, so I went upstairs to see who it was. This man here was standing in the doorway looking all flustered, and the waitress was already lying there naked and dead."
"Hmm. Did you hear anything right before that?"
"No, not really. I don't know much, but I don't think this man had time to undress her or strangle her. I came up the moment I heard footsteps, and there simply wasn't enough time for him to strip her and have his way with her. Even if she was already naked, that sort of thing takes at least ten minutes, doesn't it, sir?"
The detective winced slightly at her overly graphic explanation, but he had to admit the old woman’s logic was sound. Regardless, the culprit was clearly a man—either Sazaki or Nishiyama. The forensics on the biological evidence and their blood types would surely reveal the truth through science. For now, the detective ended the scene and took both men into custody.

(5)
Sazaki was Type A and Nishiyama was Type O. Both were so adamant about their innocence that they practically volunteered for the blood test. While the crime lab analyzed the semen samples, Haruko stayed behind in the detective's office to talk with the Chief.
"Chief, I’ve been thinking. Doesn't something seem a bit off to you?"
"What do you mean?"
"Those two suspects. I don't think either of them did it. Nishiyama was her old flame and they were going to get married; he has no motive. And Sazaki had only just met her; his motive is even weaker."
"From a motive standpoint, you have a point..."
"Furthermore," Haruko continued, "Sazaki left the bar first, making the murder impossible for him. And when he came back a second time, as the old woman said, it's biologically impossible for a man to commit such an act again in just a minute or two."
"Then who else could it be? There were no other men there."
"Just wait! Either we missed something huge, there's some elaborate trick, or there was a third person we don't know about. Those are the only three possibilities. Now, I’m not exactly an expert on these matters, but may I ask something rather blunt? Is it actually possible for a man to... well, 'perform' twice in such short succession?"
The Chief laughed. "That's a bit of a crude question for a young lady! Well, if a man is particularly vigorous and has about ten minutes between rounds, it's not impossible. But if he's been drinking, it usually takes much longer. I could always use you as a test subject for an experiment, if you like."
"Oh, don't be lewd, Chief! I'm being serious. I wouldn't ask such a thing if I weren't."
"Fine, fine. Out with it then. If I know the answer, I’ll tell you."
"Well... even on a second time, would there really be that much... volume?"
"Ho... you can take your hands off your blushing face now."
"Both Nishiyama and Sazaki were supposedly on their second time, and both had been drinking. Would there really be such a large amount of secretion? And would so much of it be spilled outside the body?"
"Hmm. I see your point. That is quite suspicious. You've got quite an eye for detail for a 'maiden,' Haruko."
"Stop teasing me! I'm embarrassed enough. But I really think this is the key to the case."
The detective fell silent, a strange look on his face. Suddenly, he shouted, "I've got it! The man who strangled her and the man who violated her were two different people!"
He continued excitedly, "She was strangled when everyone was leaving and the lights were out. Then, someone else must have come along, found her naked, and given in to their baser instincts. That's it, isn't it?"
"I'm afraid that's still not what I'm thinking," Haruko replied.
"My, what brilliant reasoning from the great detective Haruko Aozora! Here, have a cigarette. It’s a 'Shinsei'—tastes so bad I couldn't give 'em away for a fortune."
"No thank you, Chief. I don't smoke."
Just then, Dr. Machida, the police physician, entered the room with the lab results...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is presented in a standard vertical orientation (tategaki), typical of Japanese literature.
*   **Column Structure:** The page is divided into two horizontal registers (top and bottom), but the text flows as a single continuous narrative across columns.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style, common in mid-century printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The chapter number "(五)" (Five) serves as a clear section break.
*   **Censorship:** The use of "×××××" (batsu-batsu or fusen-go) is a notable editorial feature. During the mid-20th century, especially in "low-brow" pulp magazines (kasutori magazines), sexual terms were often censored with crosses or circles to bypass obscenity laws while still titillating the reader.
*   **Dialogue Tags:** Standard Japanese quotation marks (「 」) are used, with indentation for new speakers.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The terminology (e.g., *jokyu* for waitress, references to specific cigarette brands) suggests the post-WWII occupation or early Showa era.
*   **Jokyu (女給):** This term refers to "cafe waitresses" who often provided companionship and were sometimes associated with the sex trade or "erotic-grotesque" culture of the era.
*   **Shinsei (新生):** A real brand of Japanese cigarettes launched in 1949. The detective's joke about it being "unpalatable" reflects its reputation as a cheap, strong, unfiltered cigarette for the masses.
*   **Hyakuman-goku (百万石):** A reference to the wealth of feudal lords (measured in units of rice). It emphasizes that no amount of money could make the bad cigarettes good.
*   **Scientific Investigation:** The story emphasizes blood typing (A and O) and forensic analysis of "foul liquids" (semen), reflecting a post-war fascination with modern "scientific" detective work (similar to the works of Seishi Yokomizo or Rampo Edogawa).
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The "Master/Chief" detective's casual sexual harassment of the young female amateur (testing her as a "test stand") and her "blushing maiden" persona are tropes of the "ero-guro-nansensu" (erotic grotesque nonsense) literary style.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **Obsolete Kana/Spelling:**
    *   **ぢや (dya):** Modern *ja* (じゃ).
    *   **思ふ (omofu):** Modern *omou* (思う).
    *   **考へ (kangae):** Modern *kangae* (考え).
    *   **汚液 (O-eki):** Literally "dirty liquid." A euphemism used in crime fiction of the time for semen (*seieki*).
    *   **獣行 (Jukō):** "Bestial act" or "brutal conduct," here referring to rape.
    *   **辟易 (Hekieki):** To be fed up, bored, or nonplussed.
    *   **露骨 (Rokotsu):** Blunt, frank, or explicit.
    *   **姦淫 (Kan'in):** Adultery or illicit sexual intercourse (legal/formal term).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Ero-Guro (Erotic-Grotesque):** The combination of a gruesome murder, a naked victim, and explicit (though censored) discussions of sexual biology is typical of the pulp mystery genre of the era.
*   **Amateur vs. Professional:** Haruko, the female amateur, notices physical/biological details that the professional male detective overlooks, though he still maintains a position of social superiority through teasing.
*   **Science as Truth:** The belief that "science" (blood types and forensics) will solve the case is a recurring theme, though the plot hinges on Haruko's "feminine" intuition and observation of physical reality.
*   **Post-War Morality:** The casual attitude toward "mischief" (*itazura*) and "bestial acts" reflects a darker, more cynical social atmosphere following the war.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Mystery, Detective Story, Pulp.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Crime, Forensics, Ero-Guro, Gender Roles, Showa Era, Urban Mystery.
