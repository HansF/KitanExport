**閨房遊戯の一挿話**
**倦怠期突破戦術**
**実木 花**

**一、倦怠期**

久美子は戸田譲の部屋の掃除を終えると、雑巾をすすいだバケツの水を二階の窓から屋根へ流した。空になつたバケツを廊下へ置いて、戸田が大学へいつて留守の部屋へ入つた。机の前の戸田の座布団にちんまりお尻をおとし机のへりに頰をあててみる、するとほのぼのと心が和むのである。

「不思議だ」と久美子は思ふ。戸田譲の男ぶりは良いほうであらうが、久美子が好きになるタイプの顔立ちとは違ふ。むつつりと読書ばかりしているやうな人、久美子はキライである。それなのにその人の机に寄ると、心のこの甘いうづきやうは果たして何故であらうか。

「あれが原因だわ」久美子はすぐ思ひだしていた。一年ばかり前から久美子と夫の誠一とは、面白い夫婦生活をいとなんでいる。倦怠期にさしかかつていた久美子夫婦の夜のいとなみがしぜんおろそかになりだして、それが影響して二人の仲がうまくゆかなくなつたことに言い争いをするやうな暗雲低迷した頃久美子が友人から聞いてきた「倦怠期突破戦法」であつた。

友人から「教授」を受けた日の夕暮れ、久美子は新婚時代にかえつた気持でていねいに化粧して夫を待つた。夫は相変らずつまらなそうな顔をして会社から帰つて来、いかにもめんどうくさげに、久美子の唇に「ちゆつと」自分の唇をあてるだけであつた。

夫の靴と帽子をもつて茶の間へついてゆきながら
「今日Ａさんにお逢いして、いいことをきいてきましたの」
久美子は声をはずませた。
「ふん」
「私たちいつまでもこんな冷たい感情で暮らすなんてつまらないとお思いになりませんか？」
誠一は妻が夫婦別れの話でも言いだすつもりかとちよつとドキリとした。あわてて、
「お互い嫌いあつているわけではないし、無論前のように仲良しの二人に帰り度いと希望はしているんだよ。夫婦の倦怠期は、どんな蜜のように甘い新婚夫婦もいづれ一度はかからねばならないハシカなのだから、どうしようもないのではないかね」
「そのどうしようもないことを私たちの力でどうしようもあるようにできますのよ」「いつたい何のことだ。あまりむづかしいご注文は困るぜ久美子」
「ウフン、お代は見てのおかえりというものよ。さあいいからいいから」
と久美子は見世物い呼こみを真似て笑つた。誠一はそう言う妻の動作の中に久しぶりに新鮮な色つぽさを感じた。女だからだいつぱいで興奮しているときのあの美しい匂いがこぼれる。

「ただごとでない」と心が早くなきだしていた。「お床を敷いて一休みしてからよ」
久美子は夫を焦らせ、食事の仕度くに台所へ飛んでいつた。二階に下宿している大学生の戸田を呼んで三人の食事になつた。試験中の戸田は食事をさつさとすませるとすぐ自室へ戻り、誠一は食後ラヂオを掛けたが電波がスピーカに流れて来ないまえにもうスイツチを消していた。あと仕末をして座敷へ入つてきた妻へ
「もう寝るぜ」「まあー、げんきん！」久美子は軽く睨んだ。

**二、テクニック**

夫のあといからシミーズ一枚の久美子は床へ入つた。いつもならブロンディとダグウドのように背を向けあつて眠つてしまうところだが、今夜夫は久美子のほうを向いて寝ていた。
「不和の原因はね、あなたもあたしも新鮮味がなくなつたことですつて。あなただつていつもおなじ女のおなじ肉体では鼻についてくるのはムリありませんわ。だからつて新しい餌を鶏みたいに突きつめられたら私が困りますの。それで今夜から私があなたの新しい餌になるのですわ。お寝間のあいだだけ夫婦でお芝居をして気分をだすの。幸い二人とも想像力はまずいほうではないのでできつと今迄とは違つたいい夢が見られるというものですわ。脚色演出、あなたよ。頑張つてね」
「と、いつても急にお芝居も思いつかないよ久美子」「ちや脚色あたし、演出あなた」「それで」

**An Episode of Bedroom Play**
**Tactics for Breaking Through the Period of Lassitude**
**By Miki Hana**

**1. Period of Lassitude**

When Kumiko finished cleaning Toda Yuzuru's room, she poured the bucket water used to rinse the rag out of the second-floor window onto the roof. Placing the empty bucket in the hallway, she entered the room while Toda was away at university. Dropping her bottom compactly onto Toda's cushion in front of the desk, she pressed her cheek against the edge of the desk. When she did, her heart warmed faintly.

"It's strange," Kumiko thought. Toda Yuzuru's looks were probably on the good side, but they differed from the type of features Kumiko liked. A person who seems to do nothing but read in silence—Kumiko disliked such people. Despite that, when she approached that person's desk, why on earth did this sweet aching of the heart occur?

"That is the cause," Kumiko immediately remembered. From about one year ago, Kumiko and her husband Seiichi had been leading an uninteresting married life. Approaching the period of lassitude, Kumiko's couple's nightly activities naturally started to become neglected, and influenced by that, the relationship between the two stopped going well. Around the time of hanging dark clouds like having arguments, it was the "Period of Lassitude Breakthrough Tactics" that Kumiko had heard from a friend.

On the evening of the day she received "instruction" from her friend, Kumiko waited for her husband, having carefully applied makeup with the feeling of returning to the honeymoon period. Her husband, as usual, returned from the company with a bored-looking face, and extremely bothersomely, only pressed his own lips with a "chu" against Kumiko's lips.

While carrying her husband's shoes and hat and following to the living room:
"Today I met Mr. A and heard something good."
Kumiko let her voice bounce.
"Humph."
"Don't you think it's boring for us to live with such cold emotions forever?"
Seiichi felt a bit of a shock, thinking perhaps his wife intended to start talking about divorce. In a hurry:
"It's not that we hate each other, and of course, I hope to return to being the close couple we were before. A couple's period of lassitude is like the measles that even a honeymoon couple sweet as honey must eventually catch once, so it can't be helped, can it?"
"That 'can't be helped' thing, we can make it so it 'can be helped' with our own power."
"What on earth is it? Too difficult a request is troublesome, Kumiko."
"Ufun, 'the payment is upon seeing it on the way out' as they say. Come on, it's fine, it's fine."
Kumiko laughed, imitating a show's barker. Seiichi felt a long-lost fresh sexiness in his wife's movements as she said that. Overflowing with womanhood, that beautiful scent from when one is excited spills out.

"It's not a trivial matter," his heart had begun to cry out early. "Lay out the bedding and take a rest first."
Kumiko made her husband impatient and flew to the kitchen for meal preparations. Calling Toda, the university student lodging on the second floor, it became a meal for three. Toda, in the middle of exams, finished the meal quickly and immediately returned to his own room. Seiichi turned on the radio after the meal, but before the radio waves could flow to the speaker, he had already turned off the switch. To his wife who entered the parlor after finishing the cleanup:
"I'm going to bed already."
"My, how literal-minded!" Kumiko glared lightly.

**2. Technique**

Following her husband, Kumiko, in just a single chemise, entered the bedding. Usually, they would sleep facing away from each other like Blondie and Dagwood, but tonight, the husband was sleeping facing toward Kumiko.
"The cause of the discord, they say, is that both you and I have lost our freshness. Even for you, with the same woman's same body always, it's no wonder it starts to get on your nerves. But because of that, if you were to peck at new bait like a chicken, I would be troubled. So, from tonight, I will become your new bait. Only while in the bedroom, we will act in a play as a couple to create a mood. Fortunately, since neither of our imaginations is on the bad side, it's a thing where we can surely see a good dream different from before. Scripting and directing, it's you. Do your best."
"Even if you say that, I can't suddenly think of a play, Kumiko."
"Well then, scripting by me, directing by you."
"And then..."

**A Bedroom Playlet: Tactics for Overcoming the Marital Slump**
**By Hana Miki**

**I. The Ennui**

Having finished cleaning Toda’s room, Kumiko emptied the bucket of rinse water out the second-story window and onto the roof below. She left the empty bucket in the hallway and slipped back into the room while Toda was away at his university lectures. She sat herself neatly on his floor cushion and rested her cheek against the edge of his desk. A faint, gentle warmth suffused her heart.

*How strange,* she thought. Toda was handsome enough, but he wasn't really her type. She usually disliked the brooding, bookish sort. And yet, whenever she was near his desk, she felt this sweet, localized ache. What could it be?

"That’s the root of it," she realized instantly. For about a year now, Kumiko and her husband, Seiichi, had been mired in a stale, uninspired marriage. As they drifted into that inevitable "period of lassitude," their intimacy had naturally dwindled. This had cast a pall over their entire relationship, leading to constant bickering. It was during this dark period that Kumiko had sought advice from a friend and learned the "Tactics for Breaking the Slump."

On the evening after her "tutoring" session, Kumiko waited for Seiichi, having applied her makeup as meticulously as she did during their honeymoon. He returned from work with his usual mask of boredom. With an air of utter obligation, he gave her a perfunctory peck on the lips—a dry "chu"—and nothing more.

Following him into the sitting room with his hat and shoes, Kumiko spoke up, her voice bright with forced cheer. "I saw Mr. A today, and he told me something wonderful."
"Hmph," was his only reply.
"Don't you think it’s a waste for us to keep living with such cold feelings toward one another?"
Seiichi felt a sudden jolt of alarm, wondering if she was about to ask for a divorce. "It's not that we've stopped loving each other," he said quickly. "Of course I want us to be close again. But this slump... it's like the measles. Every couple, no matter how sweet the honeymoon, has to catch it once. There’s really nothing to be done."
"But there *is* something we can do! We have the power to change it."
"What are you talking about? Don't start making difficult demands, Kumiko."
"Oh, 'pay only if you're satisfied at the end!'" she laughed, mimicking the playful barker of a carnival troupe. Seiichi noticed a sudden, long-absent spark of sensuality in her movements. She seemed radiant, exuding that intoxicating fragrance of a woman in the height of her excitement.

His heart began to race. "This is no ordinary mood," he thought. "Let’s get the beds ready and rest a bit first."
But Kumiko kept him in suspense, dashing off to the kitchen to fix dinner. They ate with Toda, their student lodger, who hurried through his meal to get back to his studies. After dinner, Seiichi turned on the radio, but he switched it off before a single sound could emerge. When Kumiko finally finished the chores and entered the room, he said, "I'm heading to bed."
"My, aren't we eager!" Kumiko teased with a playful glare.

**II. The Technique**

Kumiko followed him into bed wearing nothing but a thin chemise. Usually, they slept back-to-back like Blondie and Dagwood, but tonight, Seiichi was facing her.
"The reason for our discord," she began, "is that we've lost our 'freshness.' It’s only natural that you’d get tired of the same woman’s body day after day. But I’d be in trouble if you went looking for 'new bait' like a wandering rooster. So, starting tonight, *I* will be your new bait. When we're in the bedroom, we’re going to pretend. We’ll act out roles to set the mood. We both have good imaginations, so I’m sure we can conjure up better dreams than we’ve had lately. You’ll be the writer and director. Good luck!"
"I can't just come up with a play on the spot, Kumiko," Seiichi protested.
"Fine then. I’ll write the script, and you direct."
"And then what...?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The text follows a standard pre-modern/early-modern Japanese magazine layout: vertical text (*tate-gaki*) reading from right to left. It is divided into two numbered sections ("I. Ennui" and "II. Technique"), suggesting a "problem and solution" narrative structure.
*   **Typography:** The main title (**閨房遊戯の一挿話**) and subtitle (**倦怠期突破戦術**) are set in a large, bold, stylized font to grab attention. The author's name (**実木 花**) is positioned at the end of the title block.
*   **Visual Elements:** An illustration at the bottom shows a couple in a futon, which provides a visual cue for the "bedroom" theme. The woman is depicted looking up at the man, suggesting the playful "role-playing" discussed in the text.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is arranged in a single wide column that takes up the majority of the page, common in literary or "story" sections of magazines.
*   **Pagination:** A small "(46)" is visible at the bottom center, indicating the page number.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s to early 1950s (Showa 20s). The use of certain kanji forms and the mix of old/new kana (e.g., *ちゆつと* for *ちょっと*) points to the transitional period after WWII.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text likely appeared in a "Kasutori magazine"—low-budget, pulp-style entertainment magazines popular in the immediate post-war years. These often featured "erotic-grotesque-nonsense" (ero-guro-nansensu) themes, marriage advice, and slightly provocative stories.
*   **Marital "Lassitude" (*Kentaiki*):** A common theme in post-war lifestyle literature. As the "modern" ideal of romantic marriage faced the reality of post-war domestic struggle, magazines often published advice on how to keep the "spark" alive.
*   **Western Influence:** The reference to "Blondie and Dagwood" (the American comic strip *Blondie*) shows the heavy influence of American pop culture during the Occupation. It was a shorthand for a "typical" suburban married couple who often bickered but stayed together.
*   **Housing/Lodgers:** The mention of a university student (Toda) lodging in their house reflects the common post-war practice of families renting out rooms to make ends meet during the housing shortage.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **閨房 (Keibō):** Literally "bedroom," but carries a more classical or slightly formal/literary nuance, often used in titles regarding sexual or intimate matters.
*   **倦怠期 (Kentaiki):** The "period of weariness" or "ennui" in a marriage; a slump.
*   **ちんまり (Chinmari):** To sit snugly or compactly; often used for small, cute, or settled movements.
*   **ハシカ (Hashika - Measles):** Used metaphorically here to mean an inevitable "rite of passage" or a common ailment that everyone must go through once.
*   **お代は見てのお帰り (Odai wa mite no okaeri):** A phrase from street performing or barkers meaning "Pay what you think it's worth after you've seen the show."
*   **現金 (Genkin):** Usually means "cash," but in this slangy context, it means "calculating," "quick to change one's tune," or "materialistic/mercenary" (in response to Seiichi's sudden eagerness for bed).
*   **シミーズ (Shimīzu):** A "chemise" (slip/undergarment). Loanword from French, very common in that era for feminine loungewear.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Marriage as Performance:** The central theme is that the "natural" spark of a marriage inevitably dies, and "performance" or "acting" (*shibai*) is a necessary tool to maintain sexual interest and domestic harmony.
*   **The "New Bait" Metaphor:** Kumiko uses a somewhat cynical metaphor for sexual attraction, comparing her husband to a chicken needing "new bait." This acknowledges a very pragmatic (and perhaps slightly pessimistic) view of male desire common in post-war discourse.
*   **Domestic Power Dynamics:** While Kumiko is the one doing the chores and following her husband, she is the one who initiates the psychological "game" to fix the marriage. She uses "soft power" and playfulness to manipulate her husband into a better mood.
*   **The Lodger as a Foil:** The presence of the young student Toda serves as a subtle contrast. Kumiko feels a "sweet ache" near his desk—a hint of potential infidelity or at least a reminder of what "freshness" feels like—which motivates her to fix her own marriage through role-play.
