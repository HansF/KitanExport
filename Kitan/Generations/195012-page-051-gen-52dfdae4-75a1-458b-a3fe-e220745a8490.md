**椿 昭 彦**

「ハンドバツクありがとう、吉川さんからいただいたわ……中味、ごらんになつて？」
「拝見いたしました……」
悪びれずに言つた。
「わたし、大変な女でしょう……でもあなたの好意で、わたし眼が覚めましたわ、あのハンドバツク、そつくり中味のはいつたまま返してきたの……」
「えッ」
「今日の週末旅行に是非必要だからと言つて、あれは全部、もらつた品だつたの、わたしすんでのことに邪道へ足を踏み入れてしまうとこだつたの、あなたが、なかつたら……」
「由紀子さん、それ、ほんとうですか」
「ほんとうよ……」
「ありがとう、僕、あなたが好きだつた」

倦怠期……なんて厭な言葉であろう。
出来得ればこうした夫婦の暗礁から免がれたい一心、今日この頃の葉子だつた。
結婚生活三年目を迎えて、良人の態度が急に冷酷になつたように思われるのは、強がちその先入観ばかりからではない。現に昨夜、良人の俊二は、理由もないのに三時間も遅れて帰宅したと酒の匂いがした。
「若しや……？」
葉子は小さな胸を痛めながら、先日同窓会の席上で聴いた、男の行動を調査してくれる、秘密探偵社の話を思い出し、不安のあまり、翌日早速くだんの探偵社を訪れて、良人の素行の調査を依頼した。
「承知しました。調査報告書は一週間したら、お宅へお届けいたします」
係員の懇切な言葉にホッとして社を辞したものの、果してその結果が白と出るか、黒と出るか。若し万一……と最悪の場合を想像すると、悲しさに眼の前が真ツツに暗なり、俊二と結婚する前、たつた一度だけ唇を許した、初恋のＫの面影をいだいて、儚ない過去の感傷に耽けるのだった。

「お、姉さんぢやあない？」
突然、行手に立塞がれて、葉子はやつと我れにかえつた。弟の幹夫が降つて湧いたように舗道の真中に立つて居る。
「まあ幹夫さん」
暫らく見なかつた弟の快活な姿を懐しそうに眺めやり、近くの茶房にお茶を誘つた。
「お元気だつたのね、阿紀子さんとは円満？」
姉より一年先に結婚した弟は、コツクリと素直に頷いて見せた。葉子は深い溜息が出た。
「姉さん、どうしたの？ いやにふさぎこんでるぢやないの」
「倦怠期かもしれないワ、何も彼も面白くないの……」

三賀はいきなり手をのばして、由紀子の肩を抱きよせた。
「そんなことしちゃ、いやよい……いやあん」
言葉だけは大袈裟だつたが、由紀子は抱かれたままじつとしていた。
「電燈が明るいわねえ……」
「消しますよ……」
と言つて立つたとき、三賀を襲つたものは、由紀子が安々と男性の腕へ身を投げかけることであつた、けれど、そんな疑惑も腹の底からつきあげてくる、情慾の火が、理性の芽を焼きつくしてしまった。
三賀は抱きよせた由紀子の口へ唇を重ねた
「僕たちにはゼリーなんて、不必要だ一人だけ愛の結晶がほしい」
三賀は囁ぐように言った。
……………………終…………

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Gambit Pays Off: A High-Stakes Strategy of Deception**
**By Akihiko Tsubaki**

"Thank you for the handbag. I received it from Mr. Yoshikawa... would you like to see what’s inside?"
"I already have," he replied, without a hint of shame.
"I must seem like a terrible woman... but thanks to your kindness, I’ve come to my senses. I returned that handbag exactly as it was, with everything still inside."
"What?"
"He told me I’d absolutely need those things for our weekend trip today—they were all gifts. I was on the very brink of straying down a wicked path. If it hadn't been for you..."
"Yukiko, is that really true?"
"It's true."
"Thank you. I... I've always loved you."

*Ennui*... what a loathsome word.
These days, Kanako’s only desire was to somehow navigate her marriage away from those treacherous reefs. Now in their third year of marriage, her husband's attitude seemed to have turned suddenly cold, and she knew it wasn't just her imagination. Only last night, her husband, Shunji, had returned home three hours late for no reason, reeking of liquor.
"Could he be...?"
With a heavy heart, Kanako recalled a conversation she’d overheard at a recent school reunion about a private detective agency that investigated men’s infidelities. Driven by anxiety, she visited the agency the very next day to request a background check on her husband.
"Understood. We will deliver the report to your home in one week," the clerk said kindly.
Though she left the office feeling somewhat relieved, she was plagued by what the results might show. Would he be "white" or "black"? Imagining the worst, her world turned dark with grief. She found herself lost in fleeting nostalgia, conjuring the image of her first love, K—the only man she had ever kissed before marrying Shunji.

"Oh, Sis? Is that you?"
Startled by someone blocking her path, Kanako snapped back to reality. Her younger brother, Mikio, was standing right there in the middle of the sidewalk as if he’d appeared out of thin air.
"Oh, Mikio!"
Happy to see his cheerful face after so long, she invited him to a nearby tea room.
"How have you been? Are things still going well with Akiko?"
Her brother, who had married a year before she did, gave a simple, honest nod. Kanako let out a deep sigh.
"Sis, what’s wrong? You look terribly depressed."
"It might just be a rough patch in the marriage... Nothing seems to interest me lately."

Sanga suddenly reached out and pulled Yukiko toward him by the shoulder.
"You shouldn't do that... oh, stop," she protested.
Her words were theatrical, but she remained still in his arms.
"The light is so bright..."
"I'll turn it off," he said.
As he stood up, a flash of doubt crossed Sanga’s mind—how easily Yukiko had thrown herself into a man’s arms. But the fire of passion surging from deep within scorched away any buds of reason.
Sanga pressed his lips against hers.
"We don't need any 'jelly.' I just want one thing: the fruit of our love."
Sanga whispered the words into the darkness.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a standard three-column vertical format (*tategaki*), typical of Japanese magazines of the mid-20th century.
*   **Typography:** It uses a classic Mincho typeface. Notable is the use of large "tsu" (e.g., なつて instead of なって) and "ya/yu/yo" characters, which was the standard orthography before the comprehensive post-war script reforms were fully adopted in popular media.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is centered in the middle column with a larger font size, flanked by the author's name. The story is divided into segments by a decorative wavy line, separating the dialogue-heavy opening from the narrative body.
*   **Illustration:** A high-contrast, stylized charcoal or ink illustration sits in the lower center, depicting a romantic embrace between a man and a woman. This serves to immediately signal the genre (romance/melodrama) to the reader.
*   **Pagination:** The number (52) is visible at the bottom center, suggesting this is a single-page feature or a short story within a larger anthology or "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-war 1940s-50s):** The language and themes suggest the "Kasutori" magazine era. These were cheap, popular magazines that flourished in the chaos of post-war Japan, often focusing on pulp fiction, romance, and "erotic-grotesque" themes.
*   **Marital "Ennui" (倦怠期 - Kentaiki):** The concept of the "three-year itch" or marital boredom was a popular theme as Japan transitioned from traditional arranged marriages to more Western-influenced "love marriages," where emotional fulfillment became a standard.
*   **Private Detectives (探偵社):** The mention of hiring a detective to track a husband's infidelity reflects a growing urban middle-class anxiety and the professionalization of marital disputes in the post-war period.
*   **Western Influence:** Mentions of "handbags," "weekend trips," and "tea rooms" (*sabō*) highlight the Westernized lifestyle of the urban "modern" class of the time.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **虚々実々 (Kyokyo-jitsujitsu):** A four-character idiom meaning a contest between two parties using every trick and tactic in the book; a battle of wits where truth and falsehood are intertwined.
*   **奇襲戦法 (Kishū senpō):** Surprise attack tactics. The use of military terminology for a romantic or marital story is a common rhetorical device in pulp fiction to add drama.
*   **邪道 (Jadō):** Literally "the wrong way" or "evil path." In this context, it refers to committing adultery or falling into a scandalous affair.
*   **愛の結晶 (Ai no kesshō):** Literally "the crystal of love." A common euphemism/cliché for a baby or a child resulting from a relationship.
*   **ゼリー (Jelly):** In this specific historical and adult-themed context, "jelly" (contraceptive jelly) was a common term for birth control methods used at the time. The man saying they don't need it implies he wants to conceive a child.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Suspicion vs. Reality:** The story plays with the idea of "tactics." Kanako suspects her husband of cheating, while the dialogue in the first/last sections shows other characters (Yukiko and Sanga) navigating their own temptations and desires.
*   **Traditional vs. Modern Morality:** There is a tension between the "wicked path" (infidelity) and the desire for a "harmonious" (*enman*) marriage. The female characters are portrayed as being on the edge of "straying," saved either by a "kind man" or their own conscience.
*   **Melodramatic Tone:** The text uses heavy emotional language ("small chest hurting," "pitch black sadness," "fire of passion") to appeal to a reader seeking escapism and high drama.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The men are portrayed as either cold/suspicious (Shunji) or aggressively romantic (Sanga), while the women are portrayed as emotionally vulnerable and prone to "sentimentalizing the past."

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Short Fiction, Pulp Fiction, Melodrama.
*   **Primary Tags:** Romance, Marriage, Infidelity, Post-war Japan, Detective, Family Drama.
*   **Tone:** Sentimental, Suspenseful, Romantic.
