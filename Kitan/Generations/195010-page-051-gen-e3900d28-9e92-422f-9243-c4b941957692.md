## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

「あ、百合枝さん、君はほんとうに僕のためにやってくれますね」
「えゝ、何でも私にできることなら」
「ほんとうですか、じゃあ、僕ね、君に一生のお願いなんだ。僕のために、否、僕等の××プロダクションのために、君、すまないが犠牲（ぎせい）になつてくれないか」
「犠牲（ぎせい）？」
「ハ……、いや驚くことはないんです。君の身体（からだ）をしばらく貸してくれないかとゆうことです」
「私の体を？」
百合枝はこうした甘言で巧みに口説かれてうか／＼と魔窟へ賣り飛ばされてしまつた。
たゞの勘口（かんぐち）と思つたのは、私娼窟（ししょうくつ）でスタアの夢さめて、はじめて、我に返つた時は、もうとりかえしのつかない身体になつていた。

三、一家の犠牲となって転落（てんらく）

久子（ひさこ）の家は戦争前迄は雇人を五人も使うほどの店だった。そして彼女には未来の夫ときめられた遠縁の大学生があって、幸福そのものゝような生活をしていた。
戦災で丸焼けとなった一家は、父の臆病と弟妹の相つぐ肺患とで、相当の貯えも忽ちのうちに消費尽されてしまった。
彼女は自分が働いて一家の生活を支えるという雄々しい覚悟から、最初電話の交換手になった。けれども僅かな収入では、一家五人が生活することが出来ぬので、やがて銀行の事務員となったが、それでも生活費を得ることが出来なかった。
その銀行の重役が久子の境遇に同情してもつと収入の多い仕事を探してくれたのが、麻布（あざぶ）の料理店であつた。
彼女はそこの女中として住込んだが、思った程の収入もなく、着物等の費用が嵩むので、やはり一家の生活費を稼ぎ出す事は困難であつた。
彼女は四度目にキャバレーの女給になった。給料は僅か千円であつたが、月々平均して八千円位のチップが入るので、これなら一家を支えられるとはじめて安心した。
これで漸く父と弟妹には薬も与えられるようになった。けれど、彼女の平和は永く続かなかった。
金がほしい／＼と思っていた彼女は客に誘われるまゝ、郊外の散歩に連れ出され、温泉宿の一室で処女の誇りを失ってからは、金のために、一家の生活のために、客と肉体関係の取引きをする惨めな行為をやめることは出来なかった。
とう／＼彼女は、色街に近い場末の酒場に移って、そこのマダムとグルになって酔った客から金を絞り上げるために、酒場の二階に密室を設けて、夜毎、異る嫖客に媚を賣るようになったのである。
金さえ貰えば、どんな男にでも肉体をまかしたばかりではなかつた。金を持っていそうな客が酒場へ飲みに来ると、マダムとしめし合して、酔わして二階へ引っぱり込み、翌朝になると莫大な金額を請求した。
持合せがないと腕時計や背広の上着迄脱がした。地廻りと結託して美人局（つつもたせ）のようなこと迄した。
マダムと一緒に彼女が検挙されたのは、半年も経たない間であった。
——（了）——

男にだけ愛される資格がある「女という動物は、いざとなるといつでも実直なる男よりグウタラに正直な男よりホラ吹きの方に好意を持つ、殊にその性的生活に於ては、善良な男などは女にとって三文の価値もない」とは
化粧精神に於ては、女は狐以上である。髪にコテをあて、眉に眉墨をぬり、唇に紅樺をあてゝ化身変化を喜ぶ如く、欺かれる快感は女性にとっては最高の魅力である。
一度欺かれる快感を味うと飢えたものがパンを求めるように欺瞞を要求し、真実なる生活というものは、女性にとっては退屈以外なにも物でもない。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Ah, Yurie-san, you really will do [it] for my sake, won't you?"
"Yes, if it is anything I can do."
"Is it true? Then, I have a life-long favor for you. For me, or rather, for our XX Production, you, sorry but, won't you become a sacrifice?"
"Sacrifice?"
"Ha... no, there is nothing to be surprised at. It is that I want you to lend your body for a while."
"My body?"
Yurie was skillfully seduced by such sweet words and carelessly sold off to a den of iniquity.
What she thought was just a misunderstanding, once the dream of being a star faded in the private brothel district, when she finally came to her senses, she had already become a body that could not be taken back.

3. Falling by becoming a sacrifice for the family

Hisako's house, until before the war, was a shop that used as many as five employees. And for her, there was a distant-relative university student decided as her future husband, and she was living a life that was happiness itself.
The family, which became totally burned in war damage, due to the father's cowardice and the younger siblings' successive lung diseases, even a considerable saving was consumed and exhausted in an instant.
She, from the brave resolution of supporting the family's life by working herself, first became a telephone operator. However, with small income, five family members could not live, so eventually she became a bank clerk, but even then she could not obtain living expenses.
A director of that bank sympathized with Hisako's circumstances and looked for a job with more income for her; that was a restaurant in Azabu.
She lived in as a maid there, but there was not as much income as expected, and because costs of things like kimono piled up, as expected, earning the family's living expenses was difficult.
She, for the fourth time, became a cabaret waitress. The salary was a mere 1,000 yen, but because an average of about 8,000 yen in tips came in every month, with this she felt relieved for the first time that she could support the family.
With this, finally, she became able to give medicine to her father and siblings. But, her peace did not continue long.
She, who was thinking "I want money, I want money," while being invited by a guest, was taken out for a walk in the suburbs, and after losing her virgin's pride in a room of a hot spring inn, for the sake of money, for the sake of the family's life, she could not stop the miserable act of making transactions of physical relations with guests.
Finally, she moved to a bar in the outskirts near the red-light district, and becoming partners with the Madame there, in order to wring money from drunken guests, they set up a secret room on the second floor of the bar, and every night, she came to sell flattery to different patrons.
If only she received money, it was not only that she entrusted her body to any man. When a guest who seemed to have money came to the bar to drink, she conspired with the Madame, made him drunk, pulled him to the second floor, and when it became the next morning, demanded a vast amount of money.
If he did not have money on hand, they made him take off even his wristwatch and suit jacket. Conspiring with local thugs, she even did things like the "honey trap" (badger game).
The time she was arrested along with the Madame was in a period that had not even passed half a year.
—(End)—

"The animal called woman, when it comes down to it, always has more favor for a lazy man than a steady man, for a blowhard than an honest man. Especially in that sexual life, a good-hearted man and such are not worth three cents to a woman."
In the spirit of makeup, a woman is more than a fox. Applying a curling iron to hair, painting eyebrows with eyebrow ink, applying crimson to lips and rejoicing in transformation, the pleasure of being deceived is the highest charm for a female.
Once the pleasure of being deceived is tasted, like a hungry person seeking bread, they demand deception, and a life that is truthful is nothing but boredom for a woman.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Oh, Yurie, you really are willing to help me, aren't you?"
"Of course. If it’s within my power."
"Truly? Then, I have the favor of a lifetime to ask. For me—no, for the sake of XX Productions—I'm sorry to ask this, but would you be willing to make a sacrifice?"
"A sacrifice?"
"Ha... now, don't look so shocked. I’m simply asking to borrow your body for a short while."
"My body?"
Lured by such honeyed words and skillful persuasion, Yurie was carelessly sold off into a den of vice. She had believed it was merely a misunderstanding, but by the time her dreams of stardom had withered in a back-alley brothel and she finally came to her senses, her body was already ruined beyond repair.

**III. Falling from Grace: A Sacrifice for the Family**

Before the war, Hisako’s family owned a thriving shop with five employees. She was engaged to a distant relative, a university student, and her life seemed the very picture of happiness. However, after their home was reduced to ashes in the air raids, her father’s loss of nerve and her siblings’ recurring bouts of tuberculosis quickly drained their substantial savings.
Determined to support her family, Hisako first found work as a telephone operator. But the meager pay couldn't sustain five people. She then became a bank clerk, but the expenses still outpaced her earnings. A sympathetic bank director eventually found her a better-paying position at a restaurant in Azabu. She worked there as a live-in maid, but the high cost of kimonos and other necessities meant she still struggled to make ends meet.
Her fourth attempt at employment was as a cabaret hostess. Although her base salary was a mere thousand yen, she averaged eight thousand yen a month in tips. For the first time, she felt relieved, knowing she could finally afford medicine for her father and siblings.
But this hard-won peace was fleeting. Obsessed with the need for more money, she allowed a customer to lead her on a walk to the suburbs. In a room at a hot spring inn, she lost her virginity—and her pride. From then on, driven by the desperate need to support her family, she found herself unable to quit the miserable trade of selling her body.
Eventually, she moved to a dive bar near the red-light district. Conspiring with the Madame, she set up a secret room on the second floor to fleece drunken patrons. Every night, she sold her charms to a different stranger. She didn't stop at mere prostitution; whenever a wealthy-looking man came in, she and the Madame would get him drunk, drag him upstairs, and demand an exorbitant sum the next morning. If he couldn't pay, they stripped him of his watch and jacket. They even colluded with local thugs to run "badger game" scams. Less than six months later, she and the Madame were hauled away by the police.
—(The End)—

*On the Nature of Women:*
"A woman is a creature who, when the chips are down, will always prefer a lazy blowhard to a steady, honest man. Particularly in matters of sex, a 'good man' is worth less than three cents to her."
When it comes to the art of vanity, a woman is more cunning than a fox. Just as she delights in the transformation of curling her hair and painting her face, the thrill of being deceived is her greatest allure. Once she has tasted the pleasure of a lie, she craves deception like a starving man craves bread. To a woman, a life of simple truth is nothing but a tedious bore.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is structured in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), read from top-right to bottom-left. It features a large header for the main story ("III. Falling from Grace") and a separate introductory anecdote.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of Kanji and Hiragana, with Katakana used for loanwords (e.g., プロダクション, キャバレー, チップ). Furigana (reading aids) are provided for difficult or emphasized words like 犠牲 (*gisei*) and 身体 (*karada*). Some characters are censored with "××" (standard practice for "erotic" or "taboo" brand names or organizations in that era).
*   **Illustration:** A stylized, somewhat erotic illustration occupies the top left. It depicts a woman in a state of partial undress (wearing a slip/lingerie) sitting on a man's lap. The man is partially obscured, focusing the attention on the woman's vulnerability and "fallen" status. The artist's signature "平三" (Heizo) is visible.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is bolded and set in a larger font. The closing section is separated by a decorative line, indicating a shift from narrative to "philosophical" or "editorial" commentary.
*   **Genre:** This is a classic "True Story" or "Human Document" (実話) style piece common in the *kasutori* magazines of the late 1940s and 1950s.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** The text likely comes from a "Kasutori" magazine (named after a low-quality dreg-liquor). These magazines flourished during the Allied Occupation of Japan (1945–1952), focusing on the "3S" (Screen, Sex, Sports) and providing cheap, sensationalist entertainment for a war-weary public.
*   **Post-War Poverty:** The story reflects the harsh reality of the "burnt-out ruins" (*yakiaton*) era. Many families lost everything in air raids, and the breakdown of the traditional family structure (due to the death or illness of male breadwinners) forced many young women into the "Pan-pan" (prostitution) or "Jokyu" (hostess) trades.
*   **Medical Context:** Mention of "lung disease" (tuberculosis) was very common, as it was a leading cause of death and a significant financial burden for families in the 1940s and 50s.
*   **The "Jokyu" (Waitress/Hostess):** While technically waitresses, many "jokyu" in cabarets were expected to provide companionship and sexual favors, though the degree varied. The high "tip" (chip) culture mentioned shows where the real money was made.
*   **Beauty Trap (Tsutumotase):** The text mentions *tsutumotase* (美人局), a scam where a woman lures a man into a room, only for an "angry husband" or accomplice to burst in and demand hush money.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **犠牲 (Gisei):** "Sacrifice." Used here with high emotional weight to describe a woman selling herself for the "greater good" of her family (filial piety).
*   **魔窟 (Makutsu):** Literally "Devil's Den." A derogatory term for red-light districts or brothels.
*   **美人局 (Tsutumotase):** The "badger game" or honey trap. A classic criminal scam.
*   **地廻り (Jimawari):** Local thugs, gangsters, or racketeers who controlled specific territories.
*   **女給 (Jokyu):** Literally "female provider/waitress." In the context of the 1950s, this specifically refers to cabaret hostesses.
*   **紅樺 (Benikaba):** A brownish-red color (birch-red). Used here to describe dark red lipstick.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Filial Piety vs. Moral Degradation:** A central theme is the "noble" reason for the "ignoble" fall. The protagonist is presented as a victim of circumstance (war, family illness) rather than inherently "bad," which makes the sensationalism more palatable (and tragic) to the reader.
*   **Misogyny and Essentialism:** The final editorial section is overtly misogynistic. It characterizes women as "animals" who naturally prefer lies to truth and "bad boys" to honest men. This "biological" explanation served to rationalize the exploitation of women in the sex industry.
*   **The Fragility of the Middle Class:** The story highlights how quickly a "prosperous" family could fall into ruin due to war and illness, reflecting the collective anxiety of the post-war Japanese public.
*   **Anti-Male Sentiment:** While the woman is the one who "falls," the men (the deceptive recruiter, the cowardly father, the predatory bank director) are often the catalysts for her ruin.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
