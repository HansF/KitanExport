やないか。――しようむない事に口出しせんと商売に身入れと口争いの折柄――いっぺんどうぞ先生に座談会に出て戴きとおまして。と夫婦雑誌が頼みにくれば、どうやわいも先生と言われる身や。お雪お前は幸せ者やでと記者に振向いて
――何ぼくれんねん？……
お雪がハラハラするのを
――これ〜、こんな事でうろたえるんやない。お前も研究所長の妻だ。
料理屋の二階に応接に座ると、勝手な熱をあげて、近頃の性道徳はどうの牽制がどうのと、今迄読み耽つて来たエロ雑誌のうんちく傾けてとうとうと弁じ、医学博士も顔負けさして。
――あ〜おもろかつた。又頼んまつ。
――でもまあ、わいと云う男も三年前のモク拾いの事較べたら一応偉くなつたわい。なんと云つても雑誌や新聞に名前の出る身分になつたんや。こんどは何して儲けてこましたろ。
双眼鏡片手に競輪の女流選手の尻の振り工合評い連中ら、傍らの二十才にもならぬ女子事務員の肌をぐつと握りしめて源吉は、八百長競輪のボスを頭に描いていた。
今晩あの八番の本命の娘を引つ張つて、一丁揺らしてやろうかい。
札束の山を瞳に浮べて源吉の手はいつしか女事務員の腰の辺りへと下つていつた。（第一部了）

後　篇

――さあこれからや。と源吉は大分肥つて来たビールの腹を撫で乍ら、はたちにも満たぬ競輪娘おみつが凜つと堅くなつて、前に出されたお膳にも手をつけかねているのを楽しそうに横眼でにらんで、
――どない云うて口説いてこましたろんなあ、あんた。お見掛け通りのファンやさかい悪い様にはせえへんで。せやけど、若いのに競輪選手やるようになるについては、色々深いわけもあるこつちゃろ。いっぺんきかしてな。
きけば母親が癌で、たつた一人の兄貴が未だシベリヤ――。矢ッ張り金がほしさに女だてらの自転車乗り。
――そら仲々えらいわ。とりあえずいくらあったらええねん？ フーン五万圓くらあったらええねん？ フーン五万圓すか。こんな不細工な小娘に五万圓やるんやない、これが商賣のもとでやと、眼をつむつて、半年前から始めた当座預金の小切手帳開いて、サラサラ下等な字で書き込んで、ベタリと、ハッタリのかかった大判を押すと、
――さあ、五万圓……。
貝殻の様に身を堅くした男を知らぬおみつの体を、性研究所長のメンツにかけてもと、じんわり口説き落して、やつぱりスポーツで鍛えてあるだけにえゝお尻や――。
源吉の頭は慾情とは別に、これで明日の勝負が楽しみやとそぶいていた。
翌朝、
その足でハイヤーを飛ばして競輪場へかけつけると、予想はやつぱりお光――。どやおっさん、おみつの相手になる様な女子（おなご）は誰やろ？――
――そらあんた、と予想表開いて、このシー坊ぐらいのもんだす。せやけど今日の穴はフミ子だつせ。相手も物知り顔に苗字を合わす名前で告げる奴にそやろ〜、大きに――。
源吉は窓口でニタリと笑うと、こちらはいよいよおもろいわ。シー坊の苗字探して、そいつを百枚買い込むとぐつと胸を張つて双眼鏡握りしめ、ゆんべあんたけ絞つといたんやさかい間違いない筈や。ペタル踏む足フラフラして、青息吐息に息切れするやろ、さあ負けてくれい。
スタート切つたお光の尻が朝日に揺れて、案に相違のグンと他を引き離してトップを走る。わいはあの尻を撫でたんだぜと叫びたい優越感をぐつと押えて、源吉の車券持つ手はビリビリ震えた。
愈々最後の追込み――。
突然五番を走つていたシー坊のペタルが俄かに勢いづくと、四番、三番をさつと抜き、ダークホース二番のフミ子を悠々と追い越し、ゴール手前でおみつとスレ――、ワーツと云う歓声と共に同時に飛び込んだ。
ギョッとして、わいのゆんべの追込み足らなんだのかと気になつて、こらえらい損したかも知れん。合せて六万。

やないか。「しようもない事に口出しせず、商売に身を入れろ」と口論している最中、「一度ぜひ先生に座談会に出ていただきたい」と、夫婦雑誌の記者が頼みに来れば、「どうだ、俺も『先生』と呼ばれる身分だ。お雪、お前は幸せ者だぞ」と記者の方を向いて言った。
「いくらくれますか？」
お雪がハラハラしているのを尻目に、
「これこれ、こんなことで狼狽えるんじゃない。お前も研究所長の妻だ」
料理屋の二階の応接間に座ると、勝手な熱弁を振るい、近頃の性道徳がどうの、牽制がどうのと、今まで読み耽ってきたエロ雑誌の蘊蓄を傾けて滔々と論じ、医学博士も顔負けさせていた。
「あー、面白かった。また頼みますよ」
「でもまあ、俺という男も三年前のシケモク拾いの頃に比べたら、一応は偉くなったものだ。何と言っても雑誌や新聞に名前が出る身分になったんだ。今度は何をして儲けてやろうか」
双眼鏡を片手に競輪の女子選手の尻の振り具合を評評している連中ら。その傍らで、二十歳にもならない女子事務員の肌をぐっと握りしめて、源吉は八百長競輪のボスになることを頭に描いていた。
「今晩、あの八番の本命の娘を引っ張り出して、一丁揺らしてやろうか」
札束の山を瞳に浮かべて、源吉の手はいつしか女事務員の腰の辺りへと下っていった。（第一部了）

後篇

「さあ、これからだ」と、源吉はだいぶ肥えてきたビール腹を撫でながら、二十歳にも満たない競輪選手の娘・おみつが凛として硬くなり、前に出されたお膳にも手を付けかねているのを、楽しそうに横目で睨んで言った。
「どうやって口説いてやろうかな、あんた。見かけ通りのファンだから、悪いようにはしないよ。だけど、若いのに競輪選手になるには、色々深い事情もあることだろう。一度聞かせてくれな」
聞けば、母親が癌で、たった一人の兄がいまだシベリアに抑留されている。やはり金欲しさに、女だてらに自転車に乗っているのだという。
「それはなかなか感心だ。とりあえず、いくらあればいいんだ？ ふーん、五万円くらいか。この不細工な小娘に五万円やるんじゃない、これは商売の元手だ」と、目を瞑って、半年前から始めた当座預金の小切手帳を開き、さらさらと下手な字で書き込み、べたりと、ハッタリの効いた大判の印を押した。
「さあ、五万円だ……」
貝殻のように身を固くした、男を知らないおみつの体を、性研究所長の面目にかけてもと、じんわり口説き落とした。「やはりスポーツで鍛えてあるだけあって、いいお尻だ……」
源吉の頭は、情欲とは別に、これで明日の勝負が楽しみだと浮ついていた。
翌朝、その足でハイヤーを飛ばして競輪場へ駆けつけると、予想はやはりお光（おみつ）。「おい、おっさん。おみつの相手になるような女は誰だ？」
「そりゃあんた」と予想表を開いて、「このシー坊ぐらいのものですよ。だけど今日の穴はフミ子です」と、相手も物知り顔に苗字を冠した名前で告げる。「そうか、ありがとう」
源吉は窓口でニタリと笑うと、「これはいよいよ面白い。シー坊の車券を百枚買い込もう」と胸を張って双眼鏡を握りしめた。「昨夜、あれだけ絞っておいたんだから、間違いないはずだ。ペダルを踏む足もフラフラで、青息吐息で息切れするだろう。さあ、負けてくれ」
スタートを切ったお光の尻が朝日に揺れて、案に相違してぐんと他を引き離してトップを走る。「俺はあの尻を撫でたんだぜ」と叫びたい優越感をぐっと抑えて、源吉の車券を持つ手はビリビリと震えた。
いよいよ最後の追い込み。
突然、五番を走っていたシー坊のペダルが俄かに勢いづくと、四番、三番をさっと抜き、ダークホースの二番フミ子を悠々と追い越し、ゴール手前でおみつと並んで――「ワーッ」という歓声と共に、同時にゴールに飛び込んだ。
ギョッとして、「俺の昨夜の『追い込み』が足りなかったのか」と気になり、「これは大損したかもしれない。合わせて六万……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Isn't it so? — In the middle of an argument [telling her] not to meddle in useless things and to put her spirit into the business — "Once, by all means, we would like the Sensei (Master/Teacher) to attend a roundtable discussion," when a magazine for couples comes to ask, [he thinks] "How about it, I am also in a position to be called Sensei." Toward the reporter, looking at Oyuki, "You are a lucky person," he turned.
"How much will you give [pay] me? ..."
While Oyuki is trembling [with worry],
"Hey, don't be flustered by such a thing. You are also the wife of a Research Institute Director."
Sitting in the reception area on the second floor of a restaurant, giving a self-serving passionate speech, [saying] how the sexual morality of these days is this or that, or deterrence is this or that, pouring out the erudition of erotic magazines he had been engrossed in reading until now, talking fluently, making even Doctors of Medicine lose face.
"Ah, it was fun. Please ask again."
"But well, compared to me picking up cigarette butts three years ago, I've become somewhat great. After all, I've become a person whose name appears in magazines and newspapers. Next, what shall I do to make money?"
With binoculars in one hand, among those critiquing the way the female Keirin athletes' buttocks swing, grabbing the skin of a female clerk who is not even twenty years old, Genkichi was picturing in his head being the boss of fixed bicycle races.
"Tonight, I'll pull out that number eight favorite girl, and give her a shake [sexually/emotionally]."
Floating a mountain of cash bundles in his eyes, Genkichi's hand unknowingly moved down toward the female clerk's waist area. (End of Part 1)

Latter Part

"Now, it starts from here," Genkichi said while stroking his beer belly which had grown quite fat, looking sideways with pleasure at the Keirin girl Omitsu, not yet twenty, who had become stiff and dignified, unable to even touch the meal tray set before her.
"How shall I go about seducing her? You, I'm a fan just as I look, so I won't treat you badly. But, for someone young to become a Keirin athlete, there must be various deep reasons. Tell me once."
If he asks, the mother has cancer, and the only older brother is still in Siberia —. As expected, a woman riding a bicycle because she wants money.
"That is quite admirable. For the time being, how much do you need? Hmm, about 50,000 yen? Hmm, 50,000 yen, huh. It's not that I'm giving 50,000 yen to such an unrefined little girl; this is the capital for business," he thought, closing his eyes, opening the checkbook of the current account he started half a year ago, writing with low-class scribbled characters, and with a thud, pressing a large seal that had a bluff to it.
"Here, 50,000 yen..."
Omitsu's body, which was stiff like a seashell and did not know men, he slowly seduced, putting the prestige of the Sex Research Institute Director on the line. "As expected of someone trained in sports, it's a good butt—."
In Genkichi's head, separate from lust, he was excited thinking tomorrow's match would be fun.
The next morning, flying to the velodrome in a hired car (taxi), the favorite was indeed Omitsu (O-mitsu/O-mitsu). "Hey old man, who is the woman who can be Omitsu's opponent?"
"That would be," opening the prediction sheet, "only this Shi-bo (C-boy/girl). But today's dark horse is Fumiko." To the guy who told him the names with surnames like he knew everything, "Is that so, thanks—."
Genkichi grinned at the window, "This is getting more and more interesting. I'll buy a hundred tickets of that Shi-bo," and puffing out his chest, he gripped his binoculars. "Because I squeezed [drained/exhausted] her that much last night, there's no mistake. Her legs stepping on the pedals will be wobbly, she'll be out of breath. Come on, lose for me."
The buttocks of Omitsu, who started the race, swayed in the morning sun, and contrary to expectations, she pulled away from others and ran at the top. Restraining the sense of superiority that made him want to scream, "I stroked those buttocks!" Genkichi's hand holding the betting tickets trembled.
Finally, the last spurt—.
Suddenly, the pedals of Shi-bo, who was running in fifth place, suddenly gained momentum, quickly passing the fourth and third, leisurely overtaking the dark horse number two Fumiko, and at the goal, she was neck-and-neck with Omitsu— with a roar of a cheer, they dived in at the same time.
Startled, worrying "Was my 'final spurt' last night not enough?" he thought, "This might be a great loss. A total of 60,000."

[Text in Illustration]
"Because I squeezed you that much last night."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Don't meddle in things that don't concern you! Focus on the business!" Genkichi was in the middle of a typical spat with his wife when a reporter from a family magazine arrived with a request: "We would be honored to have the Master join our roundtable discussion." 
Genkichi puffed himself up. "See? Even I'm a 'Master' now. Oyuki, you're a lucky woman to be married to me." He turned to the reporter and got straight to the point: "How much are you paying?"
As Oyuki watched him, trembling with embarrassment, he brushed her off. "Now, now, don't be so rattled. You're the wife of a Research Institute Director."
Ensconced in a private room on the second floor of a high-end restaurant, Genkichi launched into a self-important tirade. He prattled on about "modern sexual morality" and "psychological deterrence," regurgitating snippets of "erudition" he’d scavenged from cheap erotic magazines. He spoke with such unearned authority that he would have put a real Doctor of Medicine to shame.
"Ah, that was grand. Do call on me again," he told the reporter.
To himself, he thought, *Three years ago I was a bum picking up half-smoked cigarettes off the street. Look at me now—a man whose name appears in the papers. What’s the next racket?*
Standing at the velodrome, binoculars in hand, he joined the crowd of men leering at the female cyclists’ swaying backsides. Even as he squeezed the arm of a young office clerk—a girl not even twenty—his mind was elsewhere, dreaming of becoming a kingpin of fixed bicycle races.
*Tonight, I’ll take that number eight favorite out. I’ll give her a real 'workout,'* he thought.
With visions of piles of cash dancing in his eyes, Genkichi’s hand slid further down the clerk's waist. (End of Part One)

Part Two

"Now, the real fun begins," Genkichi remarked, patting his burgeoning beer belly. He shot a predatory glance at Omitsu, a cyclist barely out of her teens. She sat across from him, stiff as a board, unable to touch a morsel of the lavish meal he’d bought her. 
"How should I play this?" he mused. "Listen, sweetheart, I’m a fan, see? I won’t do you wrong. But a girl as young as you doesn't start racing bikes without a damn good reason. Why don't you tell me your story?"
It was the usual sob story: a mother dying of cancer and an older brother still stuck in a Siberian POW camp. She was riding for the money, pure and simple.
"Well, isn't that something. How much do you need to get by? Five thousand? No, fifty thousand, eh? Well, I’m not just handing fifty thousand to a plain little thing like you—call it an investment." He closed his eyes, pulled out a checkbook he'd only recently acquired, scribbled the amount in his crude, uneducated hand, and slammed down a massive, impressive-looking seal.
"There. Fifty thousand."
Omitsu, who knew nothing of men, sat frozen like a seashell. Genkichi set to work seducing her, telling himself it was for the prestige of his "Sex Research Institute." *Built like an athlete,* he thought, *what a magnificent backside.*
But beyond the lust, Genkichi was vibrating with a different kind of excitement. He was thinking of the payout.
The next morning, he hailed a cab and sped to the velodrome. As expected, Omitsu was the favorite. "Hey, pal," he asked a regular, "who’s got the legs to beat Omitsu today?"
"Well," the man said, consulting his sheet, "there’s 'C-Boy'—she’s the only real threat. But the dark horse is Fumiko." 
Genkichi gave a greasy grin at the betting window. *This is going to be perfect.* He bought a hundred tickets for the opponent, "C-Boy," and gripped his binoculars. *I drained that girl dry last night,* he thought. *Her legs will be like jelly. She’ll be gasping for air before the second lap. Come on, lose for me!*
The race started. Omitsu’s backside swayed in the morning light, but to Genkichi's horror, she wasn't tired at all. She surged ahead, leaving the pack in the dust. He fought back the urge to scream, *I’m the one who handled those legs last night!* as his hands began to shake, clutching the now-useless tickets.
The final lap.
Suddenly, the girl in fifth—C-Boy—seemed to find a second wind. She blazed past fourth and third, effortlessly overtook the dark horse Fumiko, and caught up to Omitsu right at the finish line. The crowd erupted as the two dived across the tape neck-and-neck.
Genkichi’s heart sank. *Did I not 'work' her hard enough last night?* He felt a cold sweat break out. *I might have just blown the whole lot. Sixty thousand yen, gone.*

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The page is a classic example of post-war Japanese pulp magazine layout. It features vertical text columns with a large, central illustration that breaks up the narrative. The story is divided into "Part 1" and a "Latter Part" (後篇), suggesting a serial format.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a standard serif typeface common in mid-century printing. It includes "rubi" (furigana) for some kanji, though it's sparse. Notably, it uses iteration marks (〱) and some older kana forms (ゐ, ゑ), which were still in transition during the early post-war period.
*   **Illustration:** The drawing is done in a "gekiga-lite" or high-action cartoon style typical of the era. It depicts the protagonist, Genkichi, looking through binoculars (representing his voyeuristic and gambling nature) while a woman (Omitsu) stands behind him. The speech bubbles use a rough, handwritten style.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the second part ("後篇") is centered and larger than the body text. The use of bullet points/dashes (――) to denote dialogue is a standard literary convention of the time.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** This text likely dates from between 1948 and 1955. This was the "Kasutori" (pulp) era, characterized by cheap paper, sensationalist stories, and a focus on the "three S's": Sport, Screen, and Sex.
*   **Keirin (Bicycle Racing):** Professional bicycle racing (Keirin) was legalized in Japan in 1948 as a way to generate tax revenue for local governments in the wake of WWII. It quickly became a haven for gamblers and, occasionally, fixed matches (八百長).
*   **Post-War Hardship:** The mention of Omitsu’s brother being "still in Siberia" refers to the hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers and civilians interned in Soviet labor camps after the war. This was a common tragic trope in post-war literature.
*   **"Sexology" Fads:** The protagonist calling himself a "Sex Research Institute Director" (性研究所長) is a satirical take on the "Sexology" craze of the 1950s, where self-proclaimed experts published pseudo-scientific manuals and magazines about sexuality.
*   **Monetary Value:** 50,000 yen in the late 1940s/early 50s was a significant sum (roughly equivalent to several months' salary for a regular worker), reflecting the high-stakes nature of the gambling and the predatory nature of the protagonist.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **モク拾い (Moku-hiroi):** "Cigarette butt picking." A sign of extreme poverty in post-war Japan, where people would scavenge discarded cigarettes to reroll and smoke or sell them.
*   **ハッタリ (Hattari):** A bluff or a flashy show meant to deceive or impress.
*   **八百長 (Yaocho):** A fixed match or rigged competition.
*   **青息吐息 (Aoiki toiki):** An idiom meaning to be in great distress, gasping for breath, or at one's wit's end.
*   **ハイヤー (Haiyaa):** A "hire car" or high-end taxi, signaling Genkichi's newfound (and likely ill-gotten) wealth.
*   **どない (Donai), さかい (Sakai), ～や (Ya):** Markers of Kansai (Osaka/Kyoto area) dialect, often used in fiction to denote a character who is shrewd, earthy, or involved in the underworld.
*   **うんちく (Unchiku):** Erudition or a deep but often pedantic accumulation of knowledge.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Social Mobility through Vice:** Genkichi’s rise from a "cigarette butt picker" to a "magazine expert" and gambler represents the chaotic social mobility of the post-war ruins. He hasn't gained virtue; he's just found better rackets.
*   **Exploitation of Vulnerability:** The story highlights the predatory relationship between the wealthy/shrewd and the desperate (Omitsu). Genkichi uses Omitsu’s family tragedy (cancer, Siberia) to sexually and financially manipulate her.
*   **Sexual Objectification:** The focus on the female athletes' "buttocks" and the use of sexual exhaustion as a gambling strategy ("squeezing" her so she loses) typifies the misogynistic "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) tone of the pulp era.
*   **The Fickleness of Luck:** The ending suggests a "poetic justice" where Genkichi’s attempt to fix the race by exhausting the athlete fails, as her athletic spirit (or perhaps his own overestimation of his "virility") overcomes his machinations.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Pulp/Serial)
*   **Genre:** Kasutori-bungaku, Crime, Erotica (soft-core/suggestive), Sports (Gambling)
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Keirin, Gender exploitation, Fraud, Kansai Dialect, Nihilism.
