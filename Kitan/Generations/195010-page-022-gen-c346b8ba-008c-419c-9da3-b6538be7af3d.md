## 2️⃣ Normalized Japanese

「まだ謝らないの」
と再びあきは詰め寄った。泣き伏していた女学生は、草を踏んで近付くあきの足音を聞くと、怯えたように涙で濡れた顔を上げ、恐怖の色を浮かべて後ずさりした。
「もうやめてよ」
と弱々しい声であった。だがあきは止めようとは思わなかった。
こんな場合、中途半端であればあるほど、後から来る苛立ちがたまらないことをよく体験していた。三度、あきは女学生の襟に手をかけた。
「もっと堪忍してよ、謝るわ、謝るから許して」
　女学生が叫ぶのと同時だった。あきは手を離した。やっとしなければならぬことが済んだような気がしたのだ。
こんなことが度重なるにつれて、このあきの行為はあくどいものになって行った。我を忘れて徹底的に腕力を振るわなければ——気が済まないようになって来たのである。ちょうどモルヒネ中毒の患者が一回ごとに量を増して行くのに似た現象であった。そう言えばあきは確かにサディズム的な要素を多分に持った女のようでもある。今までは自分の不器量をひがみ、自分の不幸を呪って、その憂憤を他人に散らして心を慰めていたものが、次第にその行為自体に異常な快感を持つようになったのである。どんな綺麗な容貌の女でも、どんな富豪の娘でも、あきの暴力の前には無力な一人の女に過ぎなかった。
　あきの足下に伏して泣いて詫びを乞う一つの動物に過ぎないのであった。あきにはそれがたまらない快楽となった。
　だが一面、あきのような女には見当違いの幼稚な博愛心とも言うようなものがあるものだ。「同病相憐れむ」といった親切気がある。あきはこんな興味を一人で独占せず他人にも分けてやりたいと思うようになった。
　これが「黒百合団」の結成になった。
　ある意味では知恵の働くあきは、自分と同じ学校の、ごく容貌の良くない、しかも早熟な生徒たちを次々と口説き落として仲間に入れた。あきの感性に鋭く集まった九名の女学生たちは、皆あきと同じような考え方を持っていた。あきを入れて十名の女学生はすぐ結束して「黒百合団」と銘打った。退廃しきった女学生の風紀粛正をモットーとするのだ、とそれでも興奮して語り合った。
　最初は、いろいろと浮いた噂に上る女学生の調査から始められた。こんなことはこの女たちには何よりも面白く生き甲斐のある仕事のようであった。あきの指揮の下に喜び勇んで活躍し始めたのだ。
　あきは無論首領格、次いでひさだった。ひさはあきと同じ四年生でひどく肥えていて馬鹿力があった。米屋の娘で、闇の米を一俵近く運ぶという。それに近子、滝枝と続き、小夜という可愛い名前の生徒もいた。
　一週間足らずでこの女たちは一通りのブラックリストを作り上げ、それを参考に毎晩これらの生徒たちはあきの部屋に集まって計画を凝らした。「あの子は何時の場所でこんなことを」と報告は綿密を極め、報告する娘はその時だけ生き生きとした顔色を見せた。
　その顔色の中には、自分たちの行為を反省することなく、ただ単に他人の幸福を嫉み、他人の人格を無視し、他人の楽しみを妨げさえすればいいという狂暴な発作があった。「断然やりましょう」と机を叩く者さえいた。しかも誰もがこの行為を悪いと反省してみる気さえもなく、ただまじくじら（※目くじら）立てて猜疑する歪んだ情熱に燃えて同調した。あきは見回しながら、彼女たちはこれで幸せなんだと思うと、良いことをしたような気になって、かつて疑い深く感じた良心の呵責も全く麻痺してしまっていた。
　その晩、あきの部屋に集まると、いよいよ実行に取りかかる打ち合わせが行われた。部屋から見える表通りの遊郭らしいネオンに刺激されて、一人一人が皆映画のヒロインであるかのような幻覚にわくわくしてブラックリストを広げた。リストの一番最初には、山添真弓の名前が載っている。真弓はあきたちとは同級生で、引揚者だったが急に入る学校がなく、この学校に入っている生徒である。この学校には珍しい品の良さが下級生から慕われて、いわゆる「姉妹の縁」を結びたがる生徒が多かったが、あきたちはそれを取り上げて罵り合った。
「女同士で恋人だのお姉さんだのって、いやらしい面（つら）ありゃしない」
とひさが言い、「同性愛なんて最も憎むべき罪悪よ」と滝枝はもったいぶって顔をしかめた。
　翌くる日、学校が終わり掃除が済んで下校のベルが鳴ると、近子が校門の前で真弓を呼び止めた。真弓がニコニコと近づいて来るのを見ると、
「ちょっとお話ししたいことがあるの、裏まで来てくれない？」
と誘った。何も知らない真弓は少し怪訝そうにしていたが「いいわ」と近子の後ろから連れ立った。学校の裏には、かつて盛んな頃に造った寄宿舎があった。今は壊れ果てて物置同然で、学校園から採れる野菜などを入れる場所になっていたが、その中へ真弓を連れ込んだ。そこにはかねて打ち合わせの通り、あき以下八人の黒百合団のメンバーが待ち受けていた。その物々しさに真弓は一寸たじろいだが、思い直したように入って来ると、
「皆さんこんなところに集まって何してるの」
と無邪気に呼びかけた。
　あきは一歩進んで、「山添さん、私たちはこの学校の風紀を粛正するために集まったの。私たち、山添さんに忠告したいことがあるわ」
と切り出した。それを聞くと、その雰囲気のただならぬことに気付いて真弓は顔を硬直させたが、「私、あなた方にそんなこと言われる覚えなんかないわ」とはっきりした言い方であった。あきは意外だった。この学校にいる生徒であきの名を知らぬ者はあるまい。あきがそう言えば、恐れおののいて謝（る……）

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Not yet apologizing?"
And again Aki pressed forward. Prostrate-crying female student, grass treading approaching Aki's footsteps hearing when, frightened-like tears-wet face raising when, fear color appearing backward-stepped.
"Already stop it"
And weak voice was. But Aki stop-intending did not think.
This kind of case, half-way if it is, as much as that later coming irritation unbearable thing well experiencing was. Three times Aki female student's collar to hand applied.
"More patience do, apologize, apologize because forgive."
Female student's crying same time was. Aki hand released. Finally must do thing finished-like feeling did.
This kind of thing many times happening along with, this Aki's behavior vicious thing becoming went. Self forgetting thoroughly physical strength must wield——feeling settled-not-like becoming come was. Exactly morphine addiction patient one time each dose increasing going to similar phenomenon was. So saying if Aki surely Sadism-like elements many-to having woman-like also is. Until now own homeliness begrudging, own misfortune cursing, that resentment others to scattering heart comforting was things, gradually that behavior itself to abnormal pleasure having to became thing is. Whatever beautiful appearance woman even, whatever wealthy daughter even, Aki's violence before to powerless one woman in-passing was-not.
Aki's feet-below prostrating crying apology begging one animal except passing-was-not. Aki to that unbearable pleasure became.
But one side Aki-like woman to out-of-place childish philanthropy even called-like thing there is thing is. "Same disease mutual pitying" said kindness-spirit there is. Aki this kind of interest alone monopolizing-not others to also share-want-to think-to became.
This Black Lily Group's formation became.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Still not going to apologize?" 

Aki pressed her again. The schoolgirl, who had been lying prostrate and weeping, heard Aki’s footsteps treading across the grass. She lifted her tear-stained face, her expression clouded with terror, and recoiled.

"Please, just stop it," she pleaded in a frail voice. 

But Aki had no intention of stopping. She knew from experience that being half-hearted in these situations only led to an unbearable, lingering irritation later. For the third time, Aki grabbed the girl by the collar.

"Have mercy, I’ll apologize! I’ll apologize, so please forgive me!"

The girl’s scream and Aki’s release of her collar happened simultaneously. Aki felt as though the task she had to complete was finally done. As these incidents became more frequent, Aki’s behavior grew increasingly vicious. She reached a point where she couldn't feel satisfied unless she lost herself in the exercise of raw physical force. It was a phenomenon akin to a morphine addict requiring a larger dose with every hit. Indeed, Aki seemed a woman possessed of a significant streak of sadism. Previously, she had comforted herself by taking out her resentment over her own plain looks and misfortunes on others, but gradually, the acts themselves began to provide her with an abnormal sense of pleasure. Before Aki’s violence, no woman—no matter how beautiful or how wealthy—was anything more than a powerless victim. At Aki’s feet, they were nothing but animals prostrating themselves and begging for forgiveness. For Aki, this provided an exquisite pleasure.

Yet, in a woman like Aki, there also existed a misplaced, almost childish sense of "philanthropy." It was a sort of "misery loves company" kindness. She decided she didn't want to keep this pleasure to herself and felt compelled to share it with others.

This led to the formation of the "Black Lily Group."

Aki, who was clever in her own way, began recruiting other girls from her school—mostly those who were plain-looking and precocious—and convinced them to join her circle. These nine girls, whose sensibilities aligned sharply with Aki’s, all shared her worldview. Including Aki, the ten girls quickly united under the banner of the "Black Lily Group." They excitedly declared their motto to be the "enforcement of public morals" among the "depraved" female students.

They began by investigating girls who were the subject of various scandalous rumors. For these women, this felt like the most exciting and meaningful work they had ever done. Under Aki’s command, they set to work with gusto. Aki was, of course, the leader, followed by Hisa. Hisa was a fourth-year student like Aki, heavily built and possessed of "stupid" brute strength; as the daughter of a rice dealer, she was said to be able to carry nearly a whole bale of black-market rice by herself. Then there were Chikako, Takie, and a student with the lovely name of Sayo.

In less than a week, these women had compiled a comprehensive "blacklist." Every night, they gathered in Aki’s room to plot their moves based on the list. Reports like "That girl was doing such-and-such at this time and place" were meticulously detailed, and the girls' faces would light up with life only during these briefings.

In those expressions, there was no reflection on their own actions; there was only a violent impulse to envy the happiness of others, ignore their personhood, and interfere with their enjoyment. "Let's definitely do it!" one girl would say, slamming her hand on the desk. No one thought their actions were wrong; instead, they were all swept up in a distorted passion of petty suspicion and jealousy. As Aki looked around at them, she felt that these girls were finally "happy," and she began to feel as though she were doing something good. The pangs of conscience she had once felt were now completely paralyzed.

That night, as they gathered in Aki's room, they held a final meeting to put their plan into action. Stimulated by the neon lights of what looked like a brothel district visible from the window, they felt like heroines in a movie as they excitedly spread out the blacklist. At the very top of the list was the name Mayumi Yamazoe. Mayumi was in the same grade as Aki and the others. She was a repatriate who had recently joined the school because there were no other openings. She possessed a rare elegance that made her popular among the younger students, many of whom sought to form "sisterhood" bonds with her. Aki and her group sat around insulting her.

"Girls acting like lovers or sisters... it’s absolutely disgusting," Hisa spat. 

"Homosexuality is the most loathsome of sins," Takie added with a self-righteous grimace.

The following day, after cleaning was finished and the final bell rang, Chikako stopped Mayumi at the school gate. Seeing Mayumi approach with a smile, Chikako invited her, "I have something I want to talk to you about. Won't you come to the back of the school with me?"

Mayumi, suspecting nothing, looked a bit puzzled but agreed, "All right," and followed behind Chikako. Behind the school stood an old dormitory built during the school's heyday. Now a ruin used as a shed for vegetables from the school garden, it was there that Chikako led Mayumi. Inside, as planned, Aki and the other eight members of the Black Lily Group were waiting. Mayumi flinched at the grim atmosphere for a moment, but then, as if regaining her composure, she walked in and called out innocently:

"What are you all doing gathered in a place like this?"

Aki stepped forward. "Miss Yamazoe, we have gathered here to reform the morals of this school. We have some advice for you."

As she spoke, Mayumi finally sensed the unusual atmosphere and her face hardened. However, she replied clearly, "I don't recall having anything to be lectured about by the likes of you."

Aki was taken aback. There wasn't a student in the school who didn't know Aki’s name; she had expected Mayumi to tremble and apologize the moment she spoke...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout**: This is a single-page layout from a printed magazine. The text is arranged in **vertical columns** (*tategaki*), reading from right to left. There are approximately 12 columns of text.
*   **Typography**: The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century Japanese printing. The kanji include several **pre-reform (kyūjitai)** forms (e.g., 眞, 體, 團, 聲, 惡), though the orthography is transitioning toward modern usage.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The text is dense with no illustrations on this specific page. A page number "(22)" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Punctuation**: It uses traditional Japanese punctuation (commas, periods, and "hook" quotation marks 「 」). It also utilizes the double-dash (——) for dramatic emphasis and the iteration mark (／＼) for repeated characters like "nico-nico" (smiling).
*   **Condition**: The paper shows signs of aging (browning/foxing), typical of high-acid paper used in "kasutori" (pulp) magazines of the era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Japan, late 1940s-1950s)**: The mentions of "black-market rice" (*yami no kome*) and "repatriates" (*hikiagesha*) firmly place this story in the immediate post-WWII period. Repatriates were often treated as outsiders in Japanese schools and society.
*   **S-Class & Sisterhood**: The text mentions "Sisters" (*oneesan*) and "Sisterhood bonds" (*shimai no en*). This refers to the "Class S" subculture in Japanese girls' schools, where intense emotional (and sometimes romantic) friendships were common. 
*   **Moral Panic & "Ero-Guro"**: The story fits into the *ero-guro-nansensu* (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) tradition, specifically the "schoolgirl cruelty" subgenre. It uses the guise of "moral reform" (*fūki sukusei*) to depict sadistic bullying and group dynamics.
*   **Homosexuality as "Sin"**: The character's condemnation of "same-sex love" (*dōseiai*) as a "loathsome sin" reflects the conservative social attitudes of the time, even as the "Class S" phenomenon was a known (and often fetishized) aspect of girls' school life.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **黑百合團 (Kuro-yuri-dan)**: "Black Lily Group." The lily is a symbol of purity/girls' schools; making it "black" signifies a perversion of that purity.
*   **不器量 (Bukaryō)**: Homeliness or lack of physical beauty. This is cited as the source of the protagonist's resentment.
*   **闇の米 (Yami no kome)**: Black-market rice. In the post-war shortage, dealing in black-market food was a common survival tactic but also a sign of "toughness" or criminal leaning.
*   **引揚げ者 (Hikiagesha)**: Repatriates. Japanese people returning from former colonies (Manchuria, Korea, Taiwan) after the war.
*   **まじくじら (Majikujira)**: Likely a variation or typo of *mekujira* (目くじら), meaning to find fault or look at with a critical/scowling eye.
*   **物々しさ (Monomonoshisa)**: A grim, menacing, or exaggeratedly solemn atmosphere.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Resentment and Sadism**: The text explicitly links Aki's sadism to her "homeliness" and "misfortune." Her violence is a compensatory mechanism to reclaim power over those who are more beautiful or privileged.
*   **The Facade of Morality**: The clique uses "moral reform" as a pretext for bullying. This reflects a common rhetorical strategy where oppression is disguised as social improvement.
*   **Group Psychology**: The "Black Lily Group" represents the loss of individual conscience in a crowd. The text notes that the members' consciences were "paralyzed" by the shared excitement of victimizing others.
*   **Xenophobia/Outsider Bias**: The targeting of the "repatriate" Mayumi highlights the social friction and discrimination faced by those returning to Japan after the war.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type**: Fiction, Pulp Magazine Story (Short Story/Serial).
*   **Genre**: Drama, Thriller, School Life, *Ero-Guro*.
*   **Themes**: Bullying, Sadism, Post-war Japan, Class S (Girls' school bonds), Jealousy, Social Hierarchy.
*   **Flags**: Depicts physical abuse, psychological bullying, and homophobic sentiments.
