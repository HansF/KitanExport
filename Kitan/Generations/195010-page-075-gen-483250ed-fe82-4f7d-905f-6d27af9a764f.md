## 1️⃣ Original Japanese
私は余りの突然さに狼狽して、どうしていいか為すすべも知りませんでした。親切にすればする程、泣き沈んでゆく嫂を抱きながら気がついてみると何時の間にか自分自身取り乱しているのに気がつきました。
それから三ヶ月、二人の間は急速に結びついてゆきました。来る日も来る日も、両親の眼をぬすんでは、二人きりの悦樂に耽ってゆくのでした。
七年の間、じつと空閨を堪えてきた爛熟期の女と、悲惨な抑留生活から開放されて帰つてきた逞ましい男との邪恋は、もう嫂とか義弟とかゆる垣はありませんでした。
時には私の市場の奥の六畳で一夜を明かすこともありましたが、そんな時には、彼女は父母の起きない朝早い中に徒歩で十五分もかかる家へ帰ってゆくのでした。

二
私と一緒にいるとなんとなく心がはずむ様でしたし、何時も私の傍でじつとしているだけで満足している彼女でした。
しかし今朝の嫂の口から飛び出した言葉には驚きました。妊娠だとゆふの（ママ）です。しかも三ヶ月だとゆふ嫂の告白。いつもなら、とつくにこの市場から家へ帰っている筈なのに、今朝はその事で帰りきれないでいる彼女だったのです。
「ふゝゝゝ。透さん、なんなの深刻な顔をして」
窓から斜めに射し込んでいる午前近い陽ざしの中で、同じ寝床にはらばい乍ら煙草を吸っている私の肩を、嫂はむき出しの丸い脂肪の乗った肩をすり寄せて、私の顔をまじ／＼と見つめるのでした。
「うん、何でもないサ、一寸商売のことが気になるもんんでネ」
「ふゝ、嘘、嘘、私がお腹のことなんか話したもんだから、厭になったんでせう」
「そ、そんな、馬鹿だなあ……嫂さんそんな事あるもんですか」「そうよ。きつとそうだから、「いやだなぁ、そんな一人ぎめ……」
とは言つたものの、事実私はその時この爛れきった生活を精算しようとしてお腹の子供もなんとか処置しようと、一、何度も彼女に話しかけようとして、その度に嫂の瞬間的な驚きを思い浮かべて、どうしても言い出せないでいるのでした。
私はこれ迄の嫂との夜毎の情痴にもさ程の醜悪さを感じなかつた筈なのに改めて妊娠を告げられてみると、どつと反省みたいなものに襲われ、所詮一緒に慣れぬ二人であつてみればと、自分の今迄の迂濶さに口惜しいのでした。
「嫂さん、いつそのこと流そうかね」
私は思い迷った挙句、家でどんなに心配しているか知れない両親を思い浮かべながら、思いきって口をきりました。
「ねえ、そうしよう、嫂さんも今迄に一度だつて後指をさされた事のない人だし、将来のこともある事だから、ねえ、嫂さんそうしよう」
私がそこ迄一息に言いかけた時
「えッ、何なの透さん！」
彼女は大きな声で飛び起きると、如何にも腹立たしい様にシミーズ一枚の姿で坐り直すと、私の顔をまじ／＼と見つめるのでした。
「私、いやよ、私いやや、どんな事になつたつて流すなんていや貴方に捨てられたつて、それだけはいややわ。」
まるで憑かれたようにいきなり私にむしゃぶりついて泣き伏したのです。
今更、私になだめる何んの言葉がありましよう。子供のように激しく嗚咽をつづける嫂の半裸に近い姿を見つめるより外に方法がありませんでした。
短いシミーズの下にはち切れそうな太股の白さ。さつきからの激しい憤りにも似た困惑と痺れるような邪欲の渦との相剋に私は狂わんばかりに悩むのでした。

三
夏も過ぎ、十月の声をきくようになった午後。まだ日中にはきびしい暑さは残っているけれども、こゝ北九州にある三主山は、さすがに奥山だけに涼しい気が流れていました。
私と嫂とは陽当りのよい大き……（以下略）

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
I, by the excess of suddenness, being flustered, what to do or way to act, did not know. The more I was kind, the more she sank into weeping; while holding my sister-in-law, when I noticed, before I knew it, I myself was losing composure, I realized.
From then, three months, between the two of us, rapidly they became tied. Coming day and coming day, stealing the parents' eyes, in pleasure for only the two of us, we indulged.
A woman in her period of ripeness who for seven years had endured the lonely bedroom, and a robust man who from a tragic life of internment was released and returned; in their wicked love, there were no longer barriers like "sister-in-law" or "younger brother-in-law."
Sometimes, in the six-tatami room in the back of my market shop, we spent the whole night; at such times, she, while the father and mother were not yet awake early in the morning, to the house that takes 15 minutes by foot, would return.

II
Being with me, somehow her heart seemed to bounce, and always by my side, just being still, she was satisfied.
However, this morning, from the sister-in-law's mouth, the words that jumped out, I was surprised. Pregnancy, is what she says. Moreover, three months, is the sister-in-law's confession. Normally, long ago from this market to home she should have returned, but this morning, because of that matter, she was unable to return.
"He-he-he-he. Toru-san, what is it, making such a serious face?"
In the sunlight near noon slanting in from the window, while sprawling on the same bedding and smoking a cigarette, against my shoulder, the sister-in-law, with her bare, round, fat-carrying shoulder, pressed close and stared intently at my face.
"Yeah, it's nothing, just a bit of business matters on my mind, you know."
"He-he, lie, lie. Because I talked about the thing in my belly, you became disgusted, didn't you?"
"Th-that, you're a fool... Sister-in-law, could such a thing be?" "Yes, surely it is so, so—" "I hate that, such a self-decision..."
Though I said that, the truth was, I at that time, this festered-completely life was trying to liquidate, and the child in the belly also somehow was trying to dispose of; many times I tried to talk to her, but each time the sister-in-law's instantaneous surprise I imagined, and by all means I could not say it.
I, until now, in the nightly lust with the sister-in-law, such ugliness I should not have felt, but once pregnancy was told to me, suddenly a thing like self-reflection attacked me; after all, we are two people who cannot be together, so thinking, at my own until-now carelessness, I was regretful.
"Sister-in-law, let's just abort it, shall we?"
I, after wandering in thought, while imagining the parents who don't know how much they would worry at home, decisively broke my mouth.
"Hey, let's do that. Sister-in-law also until now is a person who has never once been pointed at from behind (gossiped about), and since there are future things to consider, hey, sister-in-law, let's do that."
When I had said that much in one breath:
"Eh! What is it, Toru-san!"
She with a loud voice jumped up, and as if truly angry, in a state of only one chemise, sat up straight, and stared intently at my face.
"I, hate it. I hate it! No matter what happens, to abort is hate! Even if I am thrown away by you, that alone is hate (I won't do it)!"
As if possessed, suddenly she lunged at me and lay weeping.
Now, what words of soothing could I have? Like a child, the sister-in-law who continued violent sobbing, at her nearly half-naked figure, other than staring, there was no way.
Under the short chemise, the whiteness of thighs about to burst. From the conflict between the confusion similar to the violent indignation from a moment ago and the numbing vortex of wicked desire, I was suffering as if to go mad.

III
Summer passed, and an afternoon when one started to hear the voice of October. In the daytime, severe heat remained, but here in North Kyushu, at Mt. Mitsunuyama, as expected of a deep mountain, a cool air was flowing.
I and the sister-in-law, in a sunny, large...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
Overwhelmed by the suddenness of it all, I was utterly at a loss. As I held my sister-in-law, who sank deeper into tears the more I tried to comfort her, I realized that I, too, had lost all composure.
In the three months that followed, our bond tightened with frightening speed. Day after day, we eluded my parents' watchful eyes to indulge in the private ecstasies of our affair. Between a woman in her prime who had endured seven years of a lonely bed and a robust man newly returned from the miseries of overseas internment, the social boundaries of "sister-in-law" and "brother-in-law" had long since crumbled. Sometimes we would spend the night together in the small six-tatami room at the back of my shop in the market. On those mornings, she would slip away before my parents woke, making the fifteen-minute trek back to her house in the early dawn.

II
Whenever she was with me, she seemed lighthearted; she was content just to sit silently by my side.
But the words that escaped her lips this morning left me reeling. She told me she was pregnant—three months along. Normally, she would have left the market for home long ago, but the weight of her confession had kept her rooted there this morning.
"Heh heh... Toru, why the long face?"
Near noon, as the sun slanted through the window, she huddled close to me while I lay on my stomach in our shared bed, smoking. Her bare, supple shoulder pressed against mine as she peered searchingly into my face.
"It’s nothing. Just some business at the shop on my mind."
"Liar. You’re only acting this way because I told you about the baby. You've grown tired of me, haven't you?"
"Don't be ridiculous... how could you think that?"
"I know it's true, because—"
"Stop it, don't just decide things for yourself..."
I said the words, but in truth, I was already looking for a way to liquidate this sordid life of ours. I wanted to "dispose" of the child. Time and again I had tried to bring it up, but the thought of the shock it would cause her stopped the words in my throat.
Until now, I hadn't felt the slightest bit of revulsion toward our nightly trysts. But now that she had announced the pregnancy, a wave of belated self-reproach crashed over me. We were two people who could never truly be together; I felt a bitter sting of regret at my own sheer carelessness.
"Look, maybe we should just... get rid of it."
Tormented by the thought of how much my parents would suffer if they knew, I finally forced the words out.
"Let's do that. You’ve never had a speck of scandal attached to your name, and we have to think about the future. Come on, let's just do it."
The moment the words left my mouth, she bolted upright.
"What did you say, Toru!?"
She sat there in nothing but her thin chemise, her face flushed with sudden fury, staring at me with wide, trembling eyes.
"I won't do it! I refuse! I don't care what happens, I won't get rid of it! Even if you throw me away, I'll never do that!"
As if possessed, she lunged at me and collapsed against my chest, sobbing uncontrollably.
I had no words to soothe her. I could do nothing but watch her, nearly naked and weeping like a child. Beneath the short hem of her chemise, the blinding whiteness of her full thighs caught my eye. Caught between a storm of indignation and a numbing vortex of illicit lust, I felt as though I were losing my mind.

III
Summer faded, and by a certain October afternoon, though the midday heat still lingered, a cool breeze drifted down from Mt. Mitsunuyama here in North Kyushu.
My sister-in-law and I were in a sun-drenched, large...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** Standard vertical Japanese orientation (*tate-gaki*). The text is divided into three numbered sections (I, II, III), suggesting a short story or a serialized novella.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard mid-century Ming-style typeface. Note the use of **rekishiteki kanazukai** (historical kana usage) such as "ゆふ" (yufu) for "いう" (iu), and "厭になったんでせう" (deshou).
*   **Punctuation:** Includes unique emphasis marks (iteration marks like "まじ／＼") and quotation marks typical of the era.
*   **Illustration:** A line-drawing at the bottom left depicts a woman reclining, likely the sister-in-law described in the text. The style is reminiscent of "Kasutori" magazines—slightly eroticized but maintaining a literary, melancholic feel.
*   **Pagination:** The page number (75) is centered at the bottom in parentheses.
*   **Column Structure:** Single wide column spanning the page height.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This term refers to the low-budget, pulp magazines that proliferated in Japan between 1946 and 1955. Named after a cheap, low-quality shochu, these magazines often focused on the "3 Ss": Sport, Screen (movies), and Sex.
*   **Repatriation (Hikiage):** The mention of "抑留生活" (internment life) refers to the millions of Japanese soldiers and civilians stranded in Soviet Siberia, China, and SE Asia after the surrender in 1945. Many returned to find their wives or family members had formed new lives or faced desperate poverty.
*   **Social Morality:** The "forbidden" nature of an affair with a sister-in-law (*ane/yome*) was a popular theme. It reflected the breakdown of traditional family structures (the *ie* system) and the moral vacuum (often called *kyodatsu* state) of the immediate post-war years.
*   **Geography:** "北九州" (Northern Kyushu) and "三主山" (Mt. Mitsunuyama/Misannyama) place the setting in a specific industrial/mountainous region of Fukuoka, known for its coal mines and markets.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **嫂 (Ane/Yome):** Technically "elder brother's wife." In this context, she is the protagonist's sister-in-law.
*   **狼狽 (Roubai):** To be flustered or panicked.
*   **空閨 (Kuukei):** Literally "empty boudoir," referring to a woman living alone without her husband (a "grass widow").
*   **爛熟期 (Ranjukuki):** "Overripe" or "at the peak of maturity," often used in erotic contexts to describe a woman in her late 20s or 30s.
*   **情痴 (Jouchi):** Blind, foolish love or sexual infatuation.
*   **シミーズ (Simiizu/Chemise):** A woman's thin undergarment/slip, a common "erotic" signifier in 1940s-50s literature.
*   **後ろ指を指される (Ushiro-yubi o sasareru):** To be pointed at from behind; to be gossiped about or stigmatized.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Moral Decay vs. Vitality:** The protagonist feels guilt and a desire to "cleanse" his life, whereas the woman clings to the pregnancy as a sign of life and rebellion against the "tragic" past.
*   **The Return of the Soldier:** The "robust man" returning from internment is presented as a primal force meeting a woman "starved" for affection. This mirrors the real-world tension of repatriated men returning to a changed domestic landscape.
*   **Class and Market Life:** The setting in a "market" (ichiba) suggests the black markets or local commercial hubs that were the lifeblood of post-war survival.
*   **Flesh and Desire:** The text oscillates between high-minded "self-reflection" and visceral descriptions of "white thighs" and "fat-laden shoulders," a hallmark of the Kasutori genre's appeal.
