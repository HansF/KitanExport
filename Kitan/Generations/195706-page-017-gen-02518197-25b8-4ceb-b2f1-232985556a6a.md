## A Record of My Abnormality/Perversity
—Female Body Bondage (Part 2)—

MINAMI Tokio

The Second Experience

Continuing from last month’s issue regarding my experiences with "Female Body Bondage," I will now speak about the act of seeing women bound by others, rather than binding them myself. In reality, it is difficult to bind women oneself, and simultaneously, the chances of actually seeing a woman who is already bound are few.
It would be good if I could accidentally see a female flagrant offender who has been arrested and restrained with handcuffs, but such opportunities are extremely rare. Due to my professional connection, I have visited the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and in such specialized locations, young women restrained with handcuffs can be seen. However, currently, unless it is a serious incident, they are not restrained with *hojō* (arresting ropes), and furthermore, they are not supposed to have their wrists bound behind their back.
This is due to the spirit of respecting and protecting fundamental human rights under the Constitution—specifically, extreme caution is required when handling women. In the case of an unconvicted person (still under investigation), they are considered an offender, and even those who are convicted and sent to prison are not generally treated so harshly. The Law on Detention stipulates that "restraining devices may only be used when an inmate attempts escape, commits violence, or attempts suicide, or when leaving the detention facility."
In the case of women who pose little risk of escape or violence, they are often not even restrained with handcuffs. (This concerns the Post-War era; the Pre-War and War-Time eras are excluded from this discussion.) Therefore, it is not easy to see women bound.
I often think strange things, like, "If only I had been born in the Edo period..." But even in that era, the sight of criminals being paraded in public or female criminals being exposed in a *takeyarai* (bamboo fence stockade) was probably extremely rare. Also, I have not had the fortunate or unfortunate experience of a robber breaking into a neighbor's house, and upon going to help, finding the wife and daughter bound... Therefore, I have almost never actually seen a woman bound by someone other than myself.
I have once seen nearly twenty women bound simultaneously—and while I write this, it is certainly not a lie—if I reveal the source, it was a women's *pan-kui kyōsō* (bun-eating contest) event that took place during an old *ban-kyōsō* (sports/race competition) program.
I initially thought it was just a side program, but I was surprised to see them individually bound from behind. Four or five groups of five women each ran, and a male student acting as an official went behind each one and bound their wrists with *hassun-maki* (eight-inch wraps). Although it was unnecessary to bind them from the start, they were all bound first, and then the starting gun fired.

## A Record of My Perversity
—Female Body Bondage (Part 2)—

Minami Tokio

The Second Experience

Continuing the subject of "Female Body Bondage" from last month’s issue, I want to discuss my experience seeing women bound by others, as opposed to binding them myself. The reality is that it is difficult to bind women personally, and equally difficult to find opportunities to actually witness women who are already restrained.
It would be ideal if one could accidentally stumble upon a female flagrant offender who had been arrested and cuffed, but such chances are exceedingly rare. Due to my professional connections, I once toured the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and in specialized venues like that, one might see young women restrained with handcuffs. However, nowadays, restraining ropes (*hojō*) are not used unless the incident is very serious, and certainly, binding a woman's wrists behind her back is generally prohibited.
This shift stems from the constitutional commitment to the respect and protection of fundamental human rights—especially demanding extreme caution when handling female detainees. Those awaiting trial are considered offenders, and even those who are convicted and imprisoned are not typically subjected to such harsh treatment. The Detention Law stipulates that restraining gear may only be used when an inmate poses a risk of escape, violence, or suicide, or when they are being moved outside the facility.
Furthermore, in the case of women who show little risk of escape or violence, they are rarely even subjected to handcuffs. (This applies strictly to the Post-War era; Pre-War and War-Time practices are irrelevant here.) Consequently, seeing a woman bound is not an easy feat.
I often find myself entertaining strange notions, such as wishing I had been born in the Edo period. But even then, public parading of criminals or the exposure of female offenders in a bamboo stockade (*takeyarai*) must have been highly unusual. Nor have I had the fortunate or unfortunate experience of helping a neighbor during a robbery only to find the wife and daughter bound by the intruders... Consequently, I have almost never seen a woman bound by someone other than myself.
I did once witness nearly twenty women bound simultaneously—and I assure you this is no exaggeration—though if I reveal the context, it happened during a Women's Bun-Eating Contest, part of an old campus sports competition program.
I initially thought this event was merely a side gimmick, but I was astonished to see them all bound individually from behind. Four or five teams of five women competed, and the male student officials went around to each participant and bound their wrists using an *hassun-maki* (eight-inch wrap technique). Although there was no practical reason to bind them from the start, they were all tied up first, and then the starting gun was fired. What a spectacle.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Section Title** | 我が異常性の記 (A Record of My Abnormality/Perversity) |
| **Subheading** | 女体緊縛（その二） (Female Body Bondage, Part 2) / 第二の体験 (The Second Experience) |
| **Author** | 南 時夫 (Minami Tokio) - Likely a pseudonym common in *Kitan Club* submissions/essays. |
| **Section Type** | Confessional Essay / Pseudo-Reportage. It mixes fetishistic observation with quasi-legal analysis and personal anecdotes. |
| **Editorial Voice** | The tone is intellectualizing and clinical while describing highly sexual/taboo content, characteristic of the era's ero-guro genre which sought to legitimize its interests through 'scientific' or 'sociological' observation. |
| **Target Audience** | Male readers with an interest in *kinbaku* (bondage), voyeurism, and the transgression of social norms (especially postwar legal norms). |
| **Positioning** | A recurring series, suggesting the topic of *kinbaku* was highly popular and central to the magazine’s identity. |
| **Key Transition** | The text shifts from the theoretical difficulty of finding *actual* binding (due to strict postwar laws) to an anecdotal "real-life" incident (the college sports contest) that bridges the gap between legal/criminal binding and fetishistic spectacle. |

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

| Reference | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **女体緊縛 (Jotai Kinbaku)** | Female Body Bondage. In the postwar era, this term became associated with ero-guro art and literature, moving away from older disciplinary/punishment connotations towards aesthetic and sexual practice. |
| **東京地方検察庁 (Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office)** | Mentioning a visit to the PPO (presumably as part of the author's "professional connection") lends a false sense of journalistic authority or legal expertise to the author's search for bound women, reinforcing the quasi-reportage tone. |
| **憲法上の基本的人権の尊重 (Respect for fundamental human rights under the Constitution)** | Crucial Post-War marker. After WWII (1945), the new Japanese Constitution (1947) radically altered law enforcement procedures, strictly limiting the use of physical restraint, torture, and cruel punishment, especially against women (*fujyo*). This legal shift made the realization of bondage fantasies, which relied on the aesthetics of old punishment, more difficult in real life. |
| **監護法 (Kango-hō / Detention Law)** | Refers to the laws governing the treatment of detainees and prisoners, specifically stipulating strict limitations on the use of physical restraints (*kaigu* /戒具). The author uses this reference to explain why seeing women bound is rare. |
| **戦後のことで戦前、戦中のことは論外です** | "This concerns the Post-War era; the Pre-War and War-Time eras are excluded." This explicit disclaimer serves two purposes: 1) Acknowledging the drastic legal shift, and 2) Hinting that pre-war practices were indeed harsher and more conducive to the fetish, thus exploiting historical nostalgia for institutional violence. |
| **江戸時代 (Edo Period, 1603–1868)** | The author romantically fantasizes about the Edo period, notorious for its public corporal punishment and theatrical methods of execution and restraint (like *hikimawashi* - parading the criminal). This is a common trope in *kinbaku* writing, linking the fetish back to historical forms of Japanese institutional shame/punishment. |
| **竹矢来の中で女罪人が晒されていた (Female criminals exposed in a *takeyarai*)** | A *takeyarai* is a temporary bamboo fence or stockade. *Sarashi* (晒し) means exposure or public shaming/parading. This refers to public humiliation techniques used in the Edo period, drawing upon historical Japanese tropes of female shame and exposure. |
| **バン喰競争 (Pan-kui Kyōsō / Bun-eating contest)** | A standard, often silly, sports day event in Japan (school/university). Usually, contestants run to a hanging roll/bun, hands tied, and must eat it without using their hands. Here, the bondage element (tying the wrists behind the back using an *hassun-maki*) is gratuitously added for spectacle, transforming a common, humorous athletic event into a fetishistic display under the guise of competition. |
| **八寸巻 (Hassun-maki / Eight-inch wrap)** | Refers either to a specific size (8 *sun*, about 24 cm) of cloth or rope used, or perhaps a recognizable, standardized binding technique common in amateur restraint or theatrical performance. |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Kanji) | Reading / Modern Term | Literal Meaning | Contextual / Euphemistic Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **異常性の記** (Ijōsei no Ki) | いじょうせいのき | Record of Abnormality | Record of Perversity/Sexual Fetish (referring specifically to Kinbaku). |
| **緊縛** (Kinbaku) | きんばく | Tight restraint/binding | Sexual bondage; the specific aesthetic/practice of BDSM. |
| **縄目** (Nawame) | なわめ | Rope marks/pattern | Figuratively, the state of being bound or the evidence of binding. |
| **現行犯人** (Genkō hannin) | げんこうはんにん | Flagrant offender | An arrestee/detainee; suggests a real-life context for seeing restraints. |
| **さうざら** (Souzara) | そうざら | Infrequent | Rare, seldom happening. Used to stress the difficulty of observing the fetish in reality. |
| **捕縄** (Ho-jō/Ho-nawa) | ほじょう/ほなわ | Arresting rope | Rope used by police or officials to restrain criminals; distinguished from fetishistic rope. |
| **婦女** (Fujyo) | ふじょ | Women/Females | Used in legal/institutional context, often slightly clinical or archaic. |
| **戒具** (Kaigu) | かいぐ | Restraining device | Legal/institutional term for handcuffs, leg irons, etc. |
| **引廻し** (Hikimawashi) | ひきまわし | Parading/leading around | Public shaming ritual used for criminals in the Edo period. |
| **晒す** (Sarasu) | さらす | To expose/air out | To publicly humiliate or display (as punishment). |
| **裏紙** (Uragami) | うらがみ | Scratch paper/Reverse side | Likely a misprint for **裏番組** (Ura-bangumi: a side, secondary, or hidden program/event), meaning a spectacle occurring on the periphery. |

## Themes & Subtext

| Theme | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Voyeurism** | The entire essay is structured around the difficulty of fulfilling the voyeuristic desire ("seeing women bound by others") due to legal constraints. The author seeks out institutional settings (PPO) and public spectacles (college race) to satisfy this urge, emphasizing observation over participation. |
| **Reality vs. Fantasy** | The author meticulously contrasts the historical/legal reality of restraint (harsh, rare, Constitutionally limited) with the sexual fantasy. The scarcity of "authentic" bondage heightens its value as a fetish object. |
| **Institutional Power & Control** | The text expresses a longing for the visible exercise of institutional power (Edo period punishment, police restraint) as a foundation for sexual arousal. The rigid control implied by legal bondage (handcuffs, *hojō*) is eroticized. |
| **Sexualization of Humiliation** | The college sports event exemplifies how public humiliation, even under the guise of sport, serves as a substitute for institutional bondage. The unnecessary restraint of the female students before the "Pan-kui Kyōsō" turns a mundane activity into a spectacle of forced vulnerability and submission. |
| **Postwar Anxiety** | The explicit discussion of the new Constitution and human rights laws reflects a generational or cultural anxiety regarding the loss of traditional structures of authority and discipline, which the ero-guro genre often exploited by romanticizing the pre-war/Edo past. |
