**ストリップ・ガールの綱渡り**

した。なんと素直な妻なんだろう。と彼が一番よく知つているだけに彼の帰りをどんなに待ち兼ねたかを泌々思いやつた。易々諸々のなすが儘になる妻を抱きしめて、彼は自らを恥じると共に、二度と疑う気になれなかつた。翌日、投げられたコーヒ茶椀、ラジオ、目覚時計をいそ〜買いに出掛ける彼の姿は、世にも幸福そのものだつた。
「きかしてやりたかつたね。妻のあの時の声を……」
と彼は何かあると口癖の様に僕に云う。彼の愛妻が知つたらどう思うだろう。僕（ぼく）は一生彼の為に沈黙を守つてやらねばならない。

**Strip Girl's Tightrope**

...did. What an obedient wife she is. Since he knew [this] best, he felt deeply how much she must have waited for his return. Embracing his wife who easily surrendered to everything, he felt ashamed of himself and could not doubt her again. The next day, the sight of him cheerfully going out to buy replacement coffee cups, a radio, and an alarm clock [that had been thrown] was the very picture of happiness.
"I wanted you to hear it. My wife's voice at that time..."
He says to me like a habit whenever something happens. I wonder what his beloved wife would think if she knew. I must maintain silence for his sake for the rest of my life.

**65th Tale: The Sorrows of Young Ueteru (Starving)**
**Son of a Post-war Nouveau Riche Speaks**

Bobbed-hair schoolgirls who wouldn't even give me a glance until now, once they graduate and a year or two passes, now they won't give me the time of day. Unbelievably, the standard for a 20-year-old girl's partner is an average age of 39. We youths in our twenties are treated like greenhorns, so it's disgusting. Complaints come out. Well, listen to me. Hey, you know that Sumiko, right? After all that fuss and even allowing a kiss, she suddenly left me. She departed.
Well, because my father was a new-rich man, at first my money flow was good. But "the end of money is the end of the relationship." As soon as my father stopped giving me money, she turned cold like flipping her hand, and then as if to spite me, she easily went and got married. To whom, you ask?
Well, that... it was actually to my father, who is 60 this year—.
My 27-year-old stepmother is her at 21—Ugh! Ah, I can't stand it. I felt like committing Ad-lum suicide.
Wait with patience? ...My turn will come soon? ...It's not that simple. My father started getting Yohimbine injections every day and is becoming more and more vigorous.

**66th Tale: Look Closely at the Strip Girl's Sigh**
**The Stripper Speaks**

Even at the dance hall, the "Old Age Love Group" is suddenly popular.
Company typists only follow the manager's tail. I've started wanting to get old soon, too. I'm sick of it.
"Yes, lately I've gotten quite used to it. At first it was so embarrassing, I'd fly back to the dressing room, my whole body burning hot. Those pharmacy guys are more interesting; instead of paying high prices to watch from the stage, they come to peek from the side of the dressing room. But from now on it's hard for our business. Because it's going to get colder and colder, right? There are days it's unbearable. On top of that, our shows are slowly reaching a dead end. We have to do something new and eye-catching, otherwise we can't gather customers who aren't excited by nudity anymore. Oh yes, that 'Nude Aerial Tightrope' the other day was popular and had some thrills. Being used in a circus when I was little came in handy; I actually felt a sense of superiority then. Looking down, a bunch of old men with big open mouths, despite their age, were looking up with effort, saying 'Yo-ho...' Of course, it's a small thing, but underneath I'm wearing something thin that fits perfectly, so they can't actually see anything—."

**67th Tale: Sex Education is Difficult**
**An Enlightened Old Man Speaks**

Even though I am this enlightened, my daughter is such an ignorant person. Even though she's 23 and in this era, she's a fool who doesn't even know the 'M' of Marriage. Despite my hard work to marry her off, she came back dazed the next morning.
No, it's not even a laughing matter, it's appalling. To make an example for the future, I took my daughter to an inn run by an acquaintance. Fortunately, there was a honeymooning couple staying there. I crept up to the room in question, and as expected, tremendous moaning leaked outside the room. Through the crack in the sliding door, my daughter peered in as told. Her face didn't change at all, and she didn't show shame. Hmph, how strange. Is she frigid? While thinking this, my daughter suddenly turned back and said,
"Father, is marriage like that?"
"Eh! You're strangely calm. Not even understanding this, she's an even more troublesome daughter. I took a quick peek and said, 'Look at this!'"
Lo and behold, a young newlyweds were both hard at work stuffing souvenirs into a Boston bag—.
Ah, she's an increasingly troublesome daughter—.

**The Striptease Tightrope**

...and so he did. "What a devoted wife she is," he thought. Knowing her character better than anyone, he realized just how much she must have pined for his return. As he held his wife, who had so submissively endured everything, his shame was matched only by a newfound, unshakable trust. The next day, he went out with a spring in his step to replace the coffee cups, the radio, and the alarm clock that had been smashed in their earlier quarrel. He looked like the happiest man alive.
"I wish you could have heard her," he often says to me. "I wish you could have heard her voice in that moment."
I wonder what his precious wife would think if she knew the truth. For his sake, I suppose I must take this secret to my grave.

**Chapter 65: The Sorrows of Young "Starving" Werther**
**The Son of a Nouveau Riche Tells All**

Those bob-haired schoolgirls who wouldn't give me the time of day back then? Now that they've graduated, they’re still ignoring me! Can you believe the standard age for a twenty-year-old girl’s partner is thirty-nine? We guys in our twenties are treated like pathetic amateurs. It’s enough to make anyone bitter. Take Sumiko, for instance. We were a thing; we’d go out, we even kissed. Then, out of nowhere, she dumped me. Gone. Vanished.
You see, my old man was a post-war "narikin"—a nouveau riche—so I had plenty of cash at first. But when the money dries up, so does the love. The moment my father cut off my allowance, she turned ice-cold. Then, just to twist the knife, she went and got married. And to whom?
Get this... she married my father. He’s sixty!
My twenty-seven-year-old stepmother is now twenty-one. It’s enough to make a man want to end it all. People tell me to be patient, that my "turn" will come eventually. Fat chance of that. My old man’s been taking Yohimbine injections every day and he’s more energetic than I am!

**Chapter 66: Take a Close Look at the Stripper’s Sigh**
**A Stripper Speaks**

When you go to the dance halls these days, it’s always the "Old Man Brigade" who are popular. The typists at the office are all chasing after the managers. It makes me want to hurry up and get old myself.
"Yeah, I’m pretty used to the job now. At first, I was so embarrassed I’d bolt back to the dressing room, my whole body flushed red. The guys from the pharmacy are the funniest; instead of paying for a ticket, they try to sneak a peek through the side of the dressing room. But the hard part is coming up—the cold. There are days when it’s just miserable. Besides, the shows are getting stale. If we don’t come up with something new and flashy, we’re going to lose the crowd. Nudity alone doesn't cut it anymore. That 'Nude Tightrope' act I did recently was a hit, though. I used to be in a circus as a kid, so it felt good to show off a bit. Looking down at all those old men with their mouths hanging open, trying so hard to catch a glimpse... It’s quite the sight. Of course, they can't actually see anything; I’ve got a very thin, skin-tight layer on underneath, but they don't know that!"

**Chapter 67: The Difficulty of Sex Education**
**An "Enlightened" Father Speaks**

Despite how modern and progressive I am, my daughter is hopelessly naive. She’s twenty-three years old, living in this day and age, and she doesn't have the slightest clue what marriage entails. I went to all the trouble of finding her a husband, only for her to come wandering back home the very next morning looking totally confused.
It’s not even funny. To teach her a lesson, I took her to an inn owned by a friend of mine. As luck would have it, a honeymooning couple was staying there. I led her up to their room and, sure enough, we could hear heavy moaning coming from inside. I told her to look through the crack in the door. She watched, but her face didn't change—not a blush, nothing. I thought, "Is she broken? Is she frigid?" Then she turned to me and asked:
"Father... is that what marriage is?"
"Good grief! You're far too calm," I said. "If you don't understand even this, you're more trouble than you're worth! Move over, let me see."
I took a peek, and what did I see? The young couple were frantically trying to stuff as many souvenirs as they could into their Boston bag before they had to leave.
Lord, what am I going to do with that girl?
(The End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a multi-column vertical layout (tategaki), typical of Japanese magazines. It features three distinct stories (numbered 65, 66, and 67) plus a concluding fragment of a previous story.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface used in mid-century printing. Notable is the use of *furigana* (small reading aids) for some kanji, though most are omitted, suggesting an adult target audience.
*   **Illustrations:**
    *   **Top right:** A woman in a swimsuit or lingerie balancing on a tightrope with a parasol. The style is light, breezy, and slightly erotic, characteristic of post-war *kasutori* (pulp) magazines.
    *   **Bottom left:** An older man (the "enlightened father") peering through a doorway or hole, with a shocked expression, while a younger woman looks on curiously. This visually reinforces the humor in Tale 67.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Large, bold titles for the numbered tales separate the sections. Subtitles (e.g., "The Stripper Speaks") provide context for the narrative voice.
*   **Design Features:** The hand-drawn elements (like the "777" or decorative swirls) add to the informal, tabloid-like feel of the publication.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s-Early 1950s):** This was the heyday of "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, ephemeral publications that flourished during the post-war occupation. They often focused on sex, gossip, and the struggles of the "new" Japan.
*   **Narikin (Nouveau Riche):** Tale 65 references the "post-war narikin." These were individuals who made quick fortunes in the black market or through reconstruction efforts following the destruction of WWII. The friction between their sudden wealth and traditional social structures is a common theme.
*   **Stripping Culture:** Stripping became a massive entertainment phenomenon in post-war Japan (the "Strip Theatre" era). It represented a shift toward more overt Western-style sexual entertainment, often blending with traditional circus or "misemono" (freak show/spectacle) elements, as mentioned in the "tightrope" story.
*   **Social Morality:** The stories reflect a society in flux. There is a tension between the "enlightened" (progressive/westernized) views of the older generation and the perceived "shamelessness" or "ignorance" of the youth.
*   **Yohimbine:** Mentioned in Tale 65, Yohimbine was (and is) often marketed as a treatment for erectile dysfunction or as an aphrodisiac, reflecting the era's preoccupation with virility.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Kasutori (カストリ):** While not in the text, this is the genre. It refers to a low-quality dreg-liquor, implying that these magazines were "drunk" quickly and then discarded (or caused a hangover).
*   **Ueteru (ウエテル):** A clever pun. It is the Japanese phonetic rendering of "Werther" (from Goethe's *The Sorrows of Young Werther*), but it also sounds like *uete-iru* (starving/hungry), implying the young man is "starving" for money or love.
*   **Oiru-raku (老いらく):** Refers to "old age love" or romance late in life.
*   **Nariki (成金):** Nouveau riche; literally "becoming gold/money."
*   **Boston Bag (ボストンバック):** A specific type of travel bag popular in mid-century Japan, often associated with students or newlyweds on trips.
*   **Ad-lum (アド・ルム):** Likely a mis-transcription or period slang for "Ad-lib" or perhaps a reference to a specific location/brand, though in context, it implies a dramatic, perhaps performative, suicide.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Economic Anxiety:** Tale 65 explicitly links romantic success to financial status ("The end of money is the end of the relationship"), a poignant reality in the poverty-stricken years following the war.
*   **Generational Disconnect:** Tale 67 highlights the gap between what parents *think* their children should know and the reality of the children's experiences. The punchline—that the "sounds of passion" were actually just the mundane sounds of packing luggage—subverts the father's attempt at "sex education."
*   **The Male Gaze vs. Professionalism:** In Tale 66, the stripper views her nudity as a "business" (*shobai*) and even feels a sense of professional superiority because of her circus skills, while the men are depicted as "open-mouthed" and slightly pathetic observers.
*   **Modernization and Nudity:** The text discusses how the public is becoming "desensitized" to nudity, requiring more "thrills" (like tightropes) to stay engaged, mirroring the rapid escalation of the entertainment industry in the 1950s.
