## Literal English Translation

**Erotic Obsessive: Chronicles of Philandering**
**Chronicles of the Murderous Regent**
**Author: Nobuta Haruo / Illustration: Minami Yōji**

One day, Lord Hidetsugu secretly summoned one of the court ladies and said: "Today, I have a firm order for all the waiting maids. Do not dare to disobey; make your bodies do exactly as I say. Otherwise, I shall certainly charge you with a heavy crime. Do you understand?"

Because of daily occurrences, and since there had recently been the cruel punishment of 'stone-crushing' (*ishi-zeme*), she could not understand the details but was simply terrified and said, "How could we possibly go against your wishes?"

He said, "First, every single maid must enter the bath at once and cleanse your bodies. Hurry and take turns, and enter the bathtub all together. Understood? Other matters I shall command later."

She wondered if this was another strange whim of late, but because it was a strict order, she simply obeyed, conveyed the message to the other ladies, and about ten of them entered the bathhouse together.

"What is the business today? Is there some special banquet tonight?" they whispered suspiciously among themselves while scrubbing their skin. Suddenly, the door to the bathhouse opened, and the naked Regent, Lord Hidetsugu, strode inside.

"Ah, the Lord!"
Everyone was thrown into a panic; those in the tub jumped out, and those with their legs stretched out pulled them in, all shrinking back and prostrating themselves.

"Hahaha. No need to panic. Today I have come to inspect your bare skin. The scent of bath water mixed with the scent of cosmetics is truly exceptional. First, let me take a soak."
He entered the tub and said, "Now then, you lot are 'stones' (*ishi*), aren't you?"

Hearing this, everyone was startled and looked up. Hidetsugu laughed.
"Surprised to hear 'stone'? No, I mean you are like Benzaiten statues made of stone. You've become so stiff... First, relax. Today we shall discard the distance between master and servant. There is only the distinction between man and woman."

Soon, exiting the tub, he stretched out his five limbs long upon the cypress floor of the washing area, lying on his back.
"Surely for those in inner service, a man's naked form is a rarity. Come, draw near."

The ladies exchanged glances, but eventually, one chuckled, and led by her, everyone began to laugh while shyly covering their mouths.

"The stone Benzaitens have laughed. Everyone, draw near and work together to wash this body. If two people take one limb, that makes ten for the whole body. Come, quickly. Don't just stand there laughing."

Perhaps because they returned to the natural state of humans by becoming naked, the distinction between high and low rank vanished, or perhaps they felt emboldened by being in a crowd. In the eyes of the ladies, the usual image of the terrifying Lord was gone, and they saw only a young, beautiful man's body lying there.

"Lord, your beautiful hand," one said as she approached, and then everyone clamored to get close and took hold of his body. Hidetsugu, feeling good, used one woman's white, smooth lap as a pillow. While leaving his limbs to their will, he began an appraisal of everyone's bare skin.

"First, looking at you like this... for now, it seems you are all *Biruzen*. You likely don't understand the word *Biruzen*. *Biruzen* is a Southern Barbarian word meaning a 'virgin girl' (*kimusume*). Hahaha. I wonder if there are some among you who are not *Biruzen*."

"You have white skin, but your flesh is thin. You should get a bit fatter."
"You have a good luster, but you are oily. Touching you is like sliding."
"What 'nature' are you, My Lord?" everyone laughed.
"I am of 'habitual nature' (*kuse-shō*)."
"Oh, how scary!"

They chatted and laughed again, and the bathhouse bloomed with untimely flowers.
"Oh, your skin is truly exceptional. White, lustrous, eyes narrow, and your flesh is about to burst. Here, let me see your breasts. Truly, a genuine *Biruzen*. The breasts are small, and the nipples are red like a pigeon's foot. The worn-out Lady O-sue and the like cannot compare."

"How irreverent! I shall tell the Great Lady (the wife)!"
"The Lord only praises Lady O-tatsu."
"What, O-tatsu? Indeed, your name was O-tatsu."

In this way, three or four beautiful ladies with matching faces and bodies were chosen for the night's "entertainment" (*otogi*). Especially O-tatsu, whose nipples were red like a pigeon's foot, received the greatest favor.

**The Lustful Lord: Chronicles of a Philanderer**
**The Secret Life of the Killing Regent**
By Nobuta Haruo | Illustrated by Minami Yōji

One day, Lord Hidetsugu summoned one of his court ladies in secret. "I have a command for all the maids today," he declared. "Do not think to disobey. Yield your bodies entirely to my will, or I shall see you charged with a most grievous crime. Do I make myself clear?"

Knowing his reputation—and mindful of the horrific 'stone-pressing' executions he had ordered of late—the woman was gripped by terror. "How could we ever dream of defying your Lordship?" she stammered.

"Good," he replied. "Now, have every maid enter the bath at once. Scrub yourselves clean and enter the water together. I shall provide further instructions in due course."

Though the ladies whispered among themselves, wondering what strange whim or banquet lay behind such an order, they dared not resist. Ten of them filed into the bathhouse, their voices hushed as they scrubbed their skin. Suddenly, the door swung open, and the Regent himself—utterly naked—strode into the room.

"The Lord!" they gasped.
A wave of panic swept through the steam. Women scrambled out of the tub or tucked their legs beneath them, prostrating themselves in frantic humility.

Hidetsugu let out a booming laugh. "Peace! There is no need for such a fuss. I have only come to inspect the quality of your skin. The scent of powder and oil mingling with the steam is a fine thing indeed. But first, a soak." He stepped into the water and grinned at the shivering women. "You look like stones."

They looked up, startled. 
"What? Are you shocked to be called stones? I mean you look like statues of the goddess Benzaiten—beautiful, yet so stiff and cold. Relax. Today, we cast aside the wall between master and servant. There is only man and woman here."

When he finally emerged from the tub, he sprawled out on his back upon the cypress floor. "Surely the sight of a naked man is a rarity for you cloistered flowers. Come, closer."

The ladies shared a hesitant glance until one let out a giggle. The tension broke; they all began to laugh, hiding their blushes behind their hands. 

"The stone goddesses have found their voices, I see. Now, gather 'round and wash me. Two women to a limb—that makes ten for the whole body. Be quick about it!"

In the vulnerability of nakedness, the rigid hierarchy of the court seemed to dissolve. Emboldened by their numbers, the ladies no longer saw a terrifying tyrant, but merely a handsome young man.

"Lord, your hand," one murmured, reaching out. Soon they were all upon him. Hidetsugu sighed with pleasure, resting his head on a smooth, pale thigh. As they worked on him, he began a clinical appraisal of their charms.

"At a glance, you all seem to be *virgem*—a Southern Barbarian word for a virgin. I doubt any of you knew that. I wonder, though... are there any among you who aren't so pure?"

He pointed to one. "You are pale, but too thin. You need more meat on those bones." To another: "You have a lovely glow, but your skin is oily. My hands slide right off you."
"And what of your nature, My Lord?" one teased.
"Malicious," he joked, sending them into fits of laughter.

The bathhouse was alive with their voices. "And you," Hidetsugu said, turning his gaze to a third woman. "Your skin is remarkable. Pale, lustrous, with eyes like slivers of moon and flesh so firm it might burst. Show me your breasts. Yes... a true *virgem*. Small, firm, with nipples as red as a pigeon’s foot. You put that old hag O-sue to shame."

"Oh, the scandal! I’ll tell your wife!" she giggled.
"The Lord has eyes only for O-tatsu," another pouted.
"O-tatsu, is it? A fine name."

That night, several of the most beautiful women were summoned to his chambers for 'entertainment.' But it was O-tatsu—she of the pigeon-red nipples—who remained his favorite.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** Historical Erotica (*Rekishi-ero*). This is a common genre in mid-century pulp magazines, where historical atrocities or legends are repurposed as sexual fantasies.
*   **Author Attribution:** Nobuta Haruo (信田春男). A prolific writer for *Kitan Club* and similar titles, known for "pseudohistorical" accounts.
*   **Tone:** The narrative shifts from suspense/terror (fear of the "Killing Regent") to a "liberated" erotic atmosphere. This transition suggests a fantasy of total power resulting in total sexual submission/access.
*   **Magazine Context:** This story fits the *Kitan Club* ethos of "abnormal" or "secret" histories. The use of "Southern Barbarian" (Portuguese) loanwords adds an "exotic" and "scholarly" veneer to the erotica.

---

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

*   **Toyotomi Hidetsugu (1568–1595):** The "Sesshō Kanpaku" (Regent). History remembers him as a tragic figure or a madman. His nickname "Sesshō" (Killing) comes from rumors that he practiced archery on live subjects or killed for sport. The story plays on this "monstrous" reputation to enhance the sexual tension.
*   **Ishi-zeme (石攻め):** A torture method involving placing heavy stones on the lap of a kneeling person. Its mention early in the text establishes the stakes of Hidetsugu's power.
*   **Biruzen (ビルゼン):** A phonetic rendering of the Portuguese word *virgem* (virgin). During the late Sengoku period, Portuguese influence was high in Japan. Using this term signals a "secret knowledge" or "forbidden" aspect common in pulp literature.
*   **Southern Barbarian (Nanban):** Refers to the Portuguese and Spanish. In the 1950s, *Nanban* culture was often romanticized in Japanese pulp as a time of uninhibited passion and exoticism.
*   **Nipples "red as a pigeon's foot":** A specific aesthetic marker in Edo and Showa-era erotica, signifying youth, purity, and sexual vitality.

---

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **漁色 (Gyoshoku):** Literally "hunting for color," meaning philandering or seeking out women for sex.
*   **女房衆 (Nyōbō-shū):** Court ladies or high-ranking waiting maids.
*   **五體 (Gotai):** The five parts of the body (head, both hands, both feet); effectively the whole body.
*   **お伽 (Otogi):** Literally "keeping company," but a standard euphemism for sexual service at night.
*   **擦れもの (Sure-mono):** A "worn-out" or "rubbed" person; a euphemism for a woman who is sexually experienced or "loose."

---

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Absolute Power vs. Vulnerability:** The story relies on the contrast between the Regent's ability to execute the women (the "stone-pressing") and the intimate, vulnerable act of being washed by them.
*   **Voyeurism & Inspection:** The central "pleasure" of the text is the visual and tactile inspection of the women's bodies under the guise of an "order."
*   **Class Inversion:** The text explicitly mentions that nakedness dissolves the boundary between "high and low" (*jōge-kisen*), a common trope in erotic literature to justify the "common" behavior of elite figures.

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** Moderate (Nudity, body inspection, non-explicit sexual selection).
*   **Violence:** Implied/Historical (Reference to torture/executions).
*   **Power Dynamics:** Extreme (Absolute ruler and servants).
*   **Fetish:** Bathing, group nudity, body appraisal.
