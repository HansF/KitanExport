「遊びにいらつしやいませ、お連れさまとアベックで。奇麗な敷布がしかれました。花の刺繍が出來ました。靑い靑い海のような天井。そこが貴方さまと、お連れさまをお待ちしてゐるのでございますわ。どうぞお遊びにいらつしやいませ。」
　これは手紙ではありません。野原がこう私達を誘つてゐるのです。新緑は薫風にのつて來るという。電車でも、バスでも、タクシーでもかまいませぬ。郊外に出かけるには、お手々をつないでお出でなさいませ。と初夏のよそ風が言うのです。

「ねえ、行こうよ。野原は花が咲いていて風が涼しくていいよ。」
「いいでせうね。靑い空が貴方の眼に映るだらうし、かなしい貴方の眼がもつともつと、やさしく姿を見るでせう。いきましようよ。野原の花が妻の眼を赤く燃やすでせうねえ。」
　そこで若い戀人たちは郊外へ出るのです。
「行きましようよ。ねえ、みんな行くそうでございますわ。お互に年とりましたのね。行つて昔の結婚當時の樣な氣持を拾つて來ましよう。」
　こう奥様が且那様を誘います。
　こうして都會の近郊は、ランデブウで百花綻びるのです。
　滿々とした池の丘陵の美しさ。葉櫻の樹蔭をさまよつて、萎んでいた心臓を風船玉のようにふくらませてやりろう。昔の楽しい数々をもう一度拾つて懸ろう。こう言つた人々が郊外の野を彩るのです。
　さてさて、獨身者は憂鬱ですが――そう心配はいりませぬ。
「このわたしの御化粧を御覽なさいませ。このビチ／＼と生長した身体を御覽なさいませ。この服装の美しさを御覽なさいませ。そしてわたしが何を求めているか眼を御覽なさいませ。これは皆相手が欲しい示威なのですでございますわよ。聲をかけて下さいまし、優しい言葉をねえ。」
　こうした若い娘さんが逞しく発育した体を振つて歩くのです、だから獨身者も心配はいりませぬ。
　そこで、これらの各種の場面の戀愛技巧を描いてみることにしましよう。

**第一景**
　奇麗な月夜でした。お月さんが池を泳いでいました。二人の男女が池を眺めていました。ホテルから出て来たのでしょう。きつと男は釣りたがつかつたのです。
「あ、釣竿があると、あのお月さんを池から釣りあげて、食べるんだがねえ」
　それは少しも不自然でありまでんでした。女はうつとりとそれを聞きました。だからついこんな唄を歌い出しました。
　主は釣竿、わしぁ池の鮒　釣られながらも面白い。
　女が綿々と唄う後から男はそつとよりそいました。チャンポンと誰が池に石を投げたものがありました。

**第二景**
「目と言うものは妙なもんですわねえ」
　と女が突然言いました。それは丘の櫻の木の下でのことでした。二人は手を握つていました。
「こうやつて見つめているだけで、どうしてこんなに心がわく／＼して來るのでしょう。まつたく不思議ですわ」
「眼は心の鏡と言いますからね」
「全くそうですわねえ」
　と女は言いました。だが突然びつくりした聲で叫びました。
「おやおや貴方の眼に大空が映つていますわ。そして人影も。いけませんわ。いけませんわ。わたしの顔だけ映していたいのに。外のものは何一つつ映しても不純ですわ」
「目をつぶりましようか」
「いいえ。いいわ、わたし笑えばいいわ。すると貴方の眼の中でわたしが笑いますの」

**Sky: Love Techniques**
**Romance Techniques**

Wakahara Haruo

"Please come to play, with your companion as a couple (avec). A beautiful cloth has been spread. Flower embroidery has been made. A ceiling like a blue, blue sea. That place is waiting for you and your companion. Please come to play."
This is not a letter. The fields are thus inviting us. They say the fresh greenery comes riding on the fragrant breeze. By train, by bus, or by taxi, it does not matter. To go to the suburbs, please come holding hands. Thus the early summer breeze says.

"Hey, let's go. In the fields, flowers are blooming and the wind is cool and good."
"That would be good, wouldn't it. The blue sky will probably be reflected in your eyes, and your sad eyes will more and more gently look upon the scenery. Let's go. The field flowers will make a wife's eyes burn red, won't they."
Therefore, young lovers go out to the suburbs.
"Let's go. Hey, it seems everyone is going. We have both grown old, haven't we. Let's go and pick up feelings like those at the time of our past marriage."
Thus the wife invites the husband.
In this way, the outskirts of the city are blooming with a hundred flowers in "rendezvous."
The beauty of the hills by the full pond. Wandering in the shade of the leaf-cherry trees, let's inflate the shriveled heart like a balloon. Let's walk and pick up many past joys once more. People who said this color the suburban fields.
Well, well, single people are gloomy, but—there is no need for such worry.
"Please look at this makeup of mine. Please look at this skin/body grown lively (pichi-pichi). Please look at the beauty of this clothing. And please look at my eyes for what I am seeking. This is all a demonstration of wanting a partner. Please call out to me, with kind words."
Young ladies like this walk shaking their robustly developed bodies; therefore, single people need not worry.
So, let us try to depict the romance techniques of these various scenes.

**Scene 1**
It was a beautiful moonlit night. Mr. Moon was swimming in the pond. A man and woman were gazing at the pond. They likely came out of a hotel. Surely the man wanted to fish.
"Ah, if there were a fishing rod, I would pull that moon up from the pond and eat it, wouldn't I."
That was not even slightly unnatural. The woman listened to it enchantedly. Therefore she accidentally started singing a song like this.
"The master is the fishing rod, I am the crucian carp in the pond; even while being caught, it is interesting."
While the woman sang continuously, the man quietly drew close from behind. There was something where someone threw a stone into the pond with a "champon" (splash).

**Scene 2**
"Eyes are strange things, aren't they,"
the woman suddenly said. It was under a cherry tree on a hill. The two were holding hands.
"Just by staring like this, why does the heart start thumping (waku-waku) like this? It is truly mysterious."
"They say the eyes are the mirror of the heart, after all."
"That is truly so,"
the woman said. But suddenly she cried out in a surprised voice.
"Oh my, the great sky is reflected in your eyes. And a human silhouette too. That's no good. That's no good. I want only my face to be reflected. It is impure if even one other thing is reflected."
"Shall I close my eyes?"
"No. It's fine, I should just laugh. Then, I will be laughing inside your eyes."

**The Atmosphere of Love**
**Romantic Techniques**

By Haruo Wakahara

"Won't you come out and play? Bring your partner and come as a couple. A beautiful carpet has been spread, embroidered with wildflowers. Above lies a ceiling like the vast blue sea. It is there that we await you and your beloved. Please, do come and enjoy yourselves."
This is no written invitation; it is the call of the open fields. They say the spring greenery arrives on a fragrant breeze. Whether you come by train, bus, or taxi, it matters not. The early summer breeze whispers: "If you are heading for the hills, do come hand-in-hand."

"Let's go, darling. The flowers are in bloom and the air is so refreshing."
"That sounds wonderful. The blue sky will reflect in your eyes, and those pensive eyes of yours will surely look upon the world with even greater tenderness. Yes, let us go. The vibrant blossoms will surely bring a rosy glow to your face."
And so, young lovers head for the countryside.
"Let's go, dear. It seems everyone is out today. We’ve both grown older, haven’t we? Let’s go and recapture the feelings we had when we were first married."
Thus, a wife coaxes her husband.
In this way, the city's outskirts burst into bloom with a hundred romantic rendezvous.
The beauty of the rolling hills by the brimming pond... wandering in the shade of the cherry trees after the blossoms have fallen, let us take our withered hearts and inflate them like balloons. Let us walk and gather the fragments of our past joys once more. It is these people who bring color to the suburban landscape.
Now, now—single people may feel a bit gloomy, but there is no need to fret.
"Look at my makeup. Look at my vibrant, healthy youth. Look at the elegance of my dress. And look into my eyes to see what it is I seek. This is my way of showing the world I am looking for someone. Please, do speak to me. Say something kind."
When young women walk with such spirited confidence, even the bachelors have no cause for despair.
So, let us observe the romantic techniques displayed in various scenes.

**Scene I**
It was a glorious moonlit night. The moon seemed to swim within the pond as a man and woman gazed upon the water. They had likely just stepped out from a nearby hotel. The man, it seemed, was struck by a whimsical urge to fish.
"Ah, if only I had a rod, I’d pull that moon right out of the water and devour it."
The remark didn't seem out of place at all. The woman listened, enchanted. In her reverie, she began to hum a tune:
"My love is the rod, and I am the fish; though I am caught, I find it quite a lark."
As she sang, the man stole up behind her and drew her close. Then, someone—somewhere—threw a stone into the water with a quiet splash.

**Scene II**
"The eyes are such peculiar things, aren't they?"
The woman spoke suddenly. They were beneath a cherry tree on a hill, their hands clasped together.
"Just staring like this... why does it make my heart flutter so? It's truly a mystery."
"Well, they do say the eyes are the mirror of the soul."
"Indeed they are," the woman agreed. But then, she let out a startled cry.
"Oh! I can see the whole sky reflected in your eyes. And someone else's shadow, too. Oh, I won't have it! I won't! I want my face to be the only thing you see. It feels so... crowded... to have anything else there."
"Shall I close my eyes then?"
"No, stay as you are. I’ll just smile. That way, I'll be the only thing laughing inside your eyes."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** The text is arranged in a vertical orientation (tategaki), typical of Japanese publications. It is enclosed in a decorative, hand-drawn wavy border that suggests a lighthearted, "kawaii" (cute), or feminine magazine aesthetic.
*   **Typography:** The main title uses a bold, slightly stylized font. Small katakana "furigana" (ラブ・テクニック - Love Technique) is placed above the kanji "戀愛技巧" to provide a modern, loanword flair to the traditional kanji. The author's name is placed below the title in a standard typeface.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the most prominent element, followed by the introductory prose which sets the mood. The "scenes" (第一景, 第二景) are clearly marked with bold headers to denote a change in narrative.
*   **Illustrations:** Two simple, line-drawing illustrations of couples are integrated into the text. They have a whimsical, "high-collar" (Westernized) style characteristic of mid-Showa era romantic illustrations. One depicts a couple in conversation, the other shows them by the water.
*   **Orthography:** The text uses *kyū-jitai* (old kanji forms) like 戀 (love), 樣 (manner), and 來 (come), and *rekishiteki kana-zukai* (historical kana usage) like ゐる (iru) and いらつしやいませ (irasshaimase with small 'tsu' but old style). This places the publication firmly in the late 1940s or early 1950s, just as orthographic reforms were beginning but before they were universally adopted in casual magazines.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Romance:** The text reflects the "bright" and "optimistic" romanticism of the post-WWII era in Japan. After years of austerity and war, magazines shifted toward themes of leisure, dating, and Westernized romantic ideals.
*   **Suburban Leisure:** The mention of taking a train, bus, or taxi to the "outskirts" (郊外) reflects the growing trend of city dwellers seeking nature for recreation—a hallmark of the burgeoning middle class.
*   **"Abekku" (アベック):** Derived from the French "avec" (with), this was a very popular loanword for "couples" or "dating" in the 1950s. It eventually fell out of fashion in favor of "kappuru" (couple).
*   **"Rendezvous" (ランデブウ):** Another French loanword used to give a sophisticated, romantic, and slightly exotic feel to a date.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The text encourages women to be proactive ("Look at my makeup... call out to me"). This suggests the "New Woman" or "Modern Girl" (moga) influence persisting into the post-war era, where women were consumers of fashion and romance.
*   **Author Haruo Wakahara:** Wakahara was a prolific writer of "romance manuals" and light fiction. His work often focused on the etiquette and "techniques" of modern dating, which was a subject of intense interest as social structures moved away from arranged marriages (omiai) toward "love matches" (ren'ai).

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **空 (Sora/Kara):** In the title, it likely refers to the "atmosphere" or the "open sky" under which these romances occur.
*   **薫風 (Kunpū):** A poetic term for a refreshing early summer breeze, often associated with the scent of new greenery.
*   **葉櫻 (Hazakura):** Cherry trees after the blossoms have fallen and the green leaves have sprouted. It signifies the transition from spring to early summer.
*   **ビチ／＼ (Pichi-pichi):** An onomatopoeia for something lively, fresh, or bursting with youthful energy. Today usually written as ピチピチ.
*   **示威 (Jii):** Literally "demonstration" or "display of power," used here playfully to describe a woman showing off her beauty to attract a mate.
*   **チャンポン (Champon):** Here used as an onomatopoeia for a splash in the water, though today it's most famous as a noodle dish.
*   **鮒 (Funa):** Crucian carp. Used in the song to represent the woman being "caught" by the man's "fishing rod" (attraction).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Nature as a Romantic Catalyst:** Nature is personified as an entity that "invites" couples to fall in love. The "blue sky" and "green fields" are treated as the necessary backdrop for proper romance.
*   **Westernization:** The use of French loanwords and the description of "hotels" and "taxis" emphasize a modern, Westernized lifestyle that readers aspired to.
*   **Reclaiming Youth:** The vignette about the older couple wanting to "pick up" the feelings of their honeymoon suggests a theme of emotional renewal and the idea that romance isn't just for the young.
*   **The "Technique" of Love:** By labeling these scenes as "techniques," the author implies that romance is a skill to be learned and practiced—a very popular concept in post-war "how-to" culture.
*   **Innocent Eroticism:** The dialogue about wanting to "eat the moon" or wanting to be the only thing reflected in a lover's eye is flirtatious and sentimental, typical of the "shōjo" or "romance" magazine style of the time.
