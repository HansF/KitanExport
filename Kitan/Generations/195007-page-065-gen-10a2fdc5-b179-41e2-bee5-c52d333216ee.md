## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

冷めたい夜風がさつと吹きつけた。とぼとぼと歩いた。どこをどう行つたのか彼にも分からなかつた。
あまりにも早く知らされた大人の世界――それは、若い芳太郎にとつてはあまりにも大きな衝撃であつた。
歩いている中に、豊子のあでやかな笑顔が、ぴんと突張つた乳房が、むつちりした腰のあたりが、幻のように彼の目前に現われては消えて行つた。
「明日の晩又いらつしやいね。すぐ耳のそばで聲がする。
何時の間にか、地下鐵梅田の階段を降りていた。
「兄ちやん！」
妹の美津子が、ぱたぱたと馳け寄つて来た。
「おそかつたわねえ、あたい随分心配してたのよ。どこへ行つてたの。もう新聞、みんな買つてしまつたし、さつきからずつと待つてたのよ。どうしてたのよ。ねえ、ねえどうしたの、顔色が眞青よ」
「どうもこうもないさ」
芳太郎は、ぼそりとそれだけ言つた。
「ねえ、何かあつたのね。言つて！」
「うるさい！」
彼は、はき出すように言い放つた。彼が妹に乱暴な口を聞いた事は今までなかつた。
美津子は、兄のあまりの烈しさに、しくしくと泣き出した。

その翌日、芳太郎は夜になるのを待ち兼ねて、いそいそと昨夜のホテル“レインボー”に行つた。
「やつぱり来てくれたのね」
豊子の喜び方は、一通りではなかつた。
手をとるようにして、芳太郎を部屋の中へ導き入れた。
始めて、ウイスキーと云ふ強い酒を飲まされた。船来の煙草を無理に吸わせられた。
「坊や、爪を切つておかなけりや駄目じやないの」
豊子は、叱りつけるように言つて、爪切りを持つてくると、芳太郎の手をとつて爪を切つた。
芳太郎は、始めの時よりもいくらか冷静だつた。
帰りがけには、豊子は、数枚の百円札をにぎらせることを忘れなかつた。

それから毎夜、芳太郎は、胸をおどらせながら豊子のもとへ行くようになつた。
豊子の狂態は、夜毎に強烈になつて行つた。そんなことが、一週間ばかりたつた或る晩、芳太郎が、いつものようにあたりがうす暗くなるや、ホテル“レインボー”に掛けると、豊子の部屋に錠が下りていた。
不審に思つて女中に尋ねると、
「奥さんなら、もうここにはおいでになりませんよ。お発ちになつたのよ」
女中は面倒臭そうに言つた。
「えゝつ？、居ないつて！どこへ行つたの？」
「そんなこと知らないわ」
女中は、そう言うとさつさと奥へ入つてしまつた。
全然豫期しないことだつた。昨夜、豊子はそんなこと少しも口に出さなかつた。そればかりか明日又いらつしやいねと確かに言つた筈だつた。
芳太郎は、あまのことに、気が遠くなつてしまいそうだつた。

芳太郎は、夜の裏街を、闇市を豊子の白い肉体を求めて、野良犬のようにうろつき廻つた。
気が狂いそうだった。
妹の所へも、家にも帰らなかつた。彼の足は、自然と紅燈の巷へ向くのであつた。
陰気臭い、じめじめした家々には赤い灯がともり青い灯がともつていた。たぶれるような脂肪の香りが、芳太郎に肉体の郷愁をそそる。
彼は、とある店の前で、一人の女に腕をつかまれた。白い小柄な顔だつた。
「ねえ、色男、遊んでよ……」
芳太郎は、女に引き入れられるまま――

あまりにも早く知らされた大人の世界――それは、若い芳太郎にとってはあまりにも大きな衝撃であった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Cold night wind suddenly blew against [him]. [He] trudged along. Where and how he went, even he did not know.
The adult world revealed all too soon—that was, for young Yoshitaro, an all too great shock.
While walking, Toyoko’s glamorous smiling face, [her] tautly stretched breasts, [the] plumpness around [her] waist, appeared and vanished before his eyes like an illusion.
"Come again tomorrow evening, okay?" Right by his ear, a voice sounds.
Before [he] knew it, [he] was descending the stairs of Umeda Subway.
"Big brother!"
His younger sister Miwako came running with a pitter-patter sound.
"You're late, isn't it? I was worrying quite a lot. Where did you go? Already the newspapers, everyone bought [them] up, and I've been waiting for a long time since earlier. What were you doing? Hey, hey, what happened? Your complexion is deep blue."
"It's nothing special."
Yoshitaro said only that bluntly.
"Hey, something happened, right? Tell me!"
"Shut up!"
He blurted out as if spitting. That he spoke with such violent words to his sister had never happened until now.
Miwako, at the brother’s excess of intensity, began to weep softly.

(4)
The following day, Yoshitaro, unable to wait for night to come, went excitedly to last night’s Hotel "Rainbow."
"You really came for me, didn't you?"
Toyoko’s way of rejoicing was not ordinary.
As if taking [his] hand, [she] guided Yoshitaro into the room.
For the first time, [he] was made to drink the strong liquor called whiskey. [He] was forced to smoke imported cigarettes.
"Boy, you have to cut your nails or it's no good, right?"
Toyoko, saying it as if scolding, brought nail clippers, took Yoshitaro’s hand, and cut [his] nails.
Yoshitaro was somewhat calmer than the first time.
Upon leaving, Toyoko did not forget to press several hundred-yen bills into [his] hand.

From then on every night, Yoshitaro, while making his heart dance, came to go to Toyoko's place.
Toyoko’s wild behavior became more intense every night. After such things had passed for about a week, one evening, as soon as the surroundings became dim as usual, when Yoshitaro went to Hotel "Rainbow," the lock was down on Toyoko’s room.
Thinking it suspicious and asking the maid,
"If it's the Madame, she is no longer here. She has departed."
The maid said as if it were a nuisance.
"Eh? You say she's not here! Where did she go?"
"I don't know such things."
The maid, saying so, quickly went into the back.
It was a thing not at all expected. Last night, Toyoko did not put such a thing into her mouth even a little. Not only that, she surely should have said 'Come again tomorrow.'
Yoshitaro, at the excess of the matter, was likely to lose consciousness.

Yoshitaro, through the back streets of the night, through the black market, seeking Toyoko’s white flesh, wandered around like a stray dog.
[He] felt like [he] was going crazy.
He did not return to his sister’s place, nor to his home. His feet naturally turned toward the streets of red lights.
In the gloomy, damp houses, red lights were lit and blue lights were lit. A heavy scent of fat/grease stirred in Yoshitaro a nostalgia for the flesh.
In front of a certain shop, his arm was grabbed by a woman. It was a white, small face.
"Hey, handsome, play with me..."
Yoshitaro, just as he was being pulled in by the woman—

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

A cold night wind gusted against him as he trudged aimlessly, lost in his own footsteps. The adult world had been thrust upon young Yoshitaro far too soon, leaving him reeling from the shock. As he walked, Toyoko’s radiant smile, the curve of her firm breasts, and the fullness of her hips flickered before his eyes like a fever dream. "Come back again tomorrow night," her voice whispered, right in his ear. 

Without realizing it, he found himself descending the stairs of the Umeda Subway station.
"Big brother!" his younger sister, Miwako, called out, scurrying toward him. "You’re so late! I’ve been worried sick. Where have you been? I’ve already sold all the newspapers, and I've been waiting here forever. What’s wrong? Look at you—you’re pale as a ghost!"
"It’s nothing," Yoshitaro muttered.
"Something happened, didn't it? Tell me!"
"Shut up!" he spat. He had never spoken to her so harshly before. Startled by his sudden ferocity, Miwako began to sob quietly.

IV
The next day, Yoshitaro could hardly wait for nightfall before hurrying back to the Hotel Rainbow.
"I knew you’d come," Toyoko said, her joy overwhelming. She took him by the hand and led him into her room. There, he was given his first taste of whiskey and pressed to smoke imported cigarettes. 
"My boy, you really must trim these nails," she chided him gently. She brought out clippers, took his hand in hers, and trimmed them for him. Yoshitaro felt a bit more composed than he had the night before. As he prepared to leave, Toyoko made sure to press several hundred-yen bills into his palm.

Thereafter, Yoshitaro returned to her every night, his heart pounding with anticipation. Toyoko’s behavior grew increasingly wild and unrestrained with each passing evening. A week into this routine, Yoshitaro arrived at the Hotel Rainbow just as dusk was falling, only to find her door locked.
Confused, he questioned a maid. "The lady? She isn't here anymore. She’s moved on," the woman replied dismissively.
"What? Gone? Where did she go?"
"How should I know?" the maid snapped, disappearing into the back of the building.
It was completely unexpected. Toyoko hadn't breathed a word of it the night before. In fact, she had specifically told him to come back today. Yoshitaro felt the world spinning; he was on the verge of fainting.

Driven by a desperate longing for Toyoko’s body, Yoshitaro wandered the night-shrouded back alleys and black markets like a stray dog. He felt as though he were losing his mind. He didn't go back to his sister or his home. Instead, his feet led him instinctively toward the red-light district. In those gloomy, damp houses, red and blue lights flickered. The heavy, cloying scent of grease and sweat stirred a primal ache within him. In front of one such shop, a woman grabbed his arm. She had a small, pale face.
"Hey there, handsome... want to have some fun?"
Yoshitaro allowed himself to be pulled inside.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in the traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tategaki*), reading from right to left, top to bottom.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. It uses historical kana usage (*rekishiteki kanazukai*), such as "云ふ" for *iu* and "さう" for *sou*.
*   **Illustrations:** Two line-art illustrations are embedded. 
    *   The top illustration shows a woman (Toyoko) in a patterned kimono, looking downward with a melancholic or contemplative expression. The linework is delicate, emphasizing her "glamorous" nature mentioned in the text.
    *   The bottom illustration depicts the scene where Toyoko is cutting Yoshitaro's nails, a moment of intimate "mothering" mixed with seduction.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The chapter break "四" (4) acts as a clear structural marker. The use of western-style quotation marks (" ") for the hotel name "レインボー" (Rainbow) reflects the growing influence of Western culture/occupation-era aesthetics.
*   **Page Numbering:** The number "66" is visible at the bottom right, suggesting this is part of a larger magazine or serial.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Setting:** The mention of "Umeda Subway" (Osaka) and "Black Markets" (闇市 - *yami-ichi*) places the story in the immediate post-war era. The black market was the center of survival for many Japanese people during the food shortages of the late 1940s.
*   **Newspaper Selling:** The sister, Miwako, is selling newspapers, a common job for impoverished children and orphans (*pan-pan* or street children) during the post-war period to support their families.
*   **Hotel "Rainbow" & Western Goods:** "Hotel Rainbow" and the mention of "whiskey" and "imported cigarettes" (*hakurai no tabako*) signify luxury and the influence of the Allied Occupation. These were items often obtained through the black market or from GIs.
*   **Red-Light Districts:** The "red and blue lights" refer to the *Akasen* (Redline) and *Aosen* (Blueline) districts, where prostitution was semi-legal or tolerated until the Prostitution Prevention Law of 1956.
*   **Currency:** The "hundred-yen bills" (*hyakuen-satsu*) were significant amounts of money at a time when hyperinflation and poverty were rampant. Toyoko is essentially "paying" or supporting Yoshitaro, reversing traditional gender roles of the era.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **あでやかな (Adeyakana):** Glamorous, charming, or bewitching. Often used for a woman who is sexually attractive in a sophisticated way.
*   **むっちりした (Mutchiri-shita):** Plump, fleshy, or curvaceous. Used here to describe Toyoko's hips.
*   **船来 (Hakurai):** Literally "arrived by ship." An older term for imported goods, carrying a connotation of high quality or exoticism.
*   **狂態 (Kyōtai):** Wild, shameful, or scandalous behavior. Suggests Toyoko’s behavior in bed was uninhibited.
*   **紅燈の巷 (Kōtō no巷):** Literally "the street of red lanterns." A poetic or euphemistic term for a red-light district.
*   **郷愁 (Kyōshū):** Usually means "nostalgia" or "homesickness," but here it is used metaphorically for a visceral, bodily craving or "nostalgia for the flesh."
*   **色男 (Irootoko):** A "lady-killer," "playboy," or "handsome man." Used here by the prostitute to entice Yoshitaro.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Loss of Innocence:** Yoshitaro is portrayed as a youth who is quickly "corrupted" or initiated into the "adult world" of sex, alcohol, and money. His transition from a protective older brother to a "stray dog" in the red-light district marks a moral decline.
*   **Nihilism and Disposability:** Toyoko’s sudden disappearance without a word reflects the instability of the post-war era. Relationships are fleeting, and people disappear into the "back alleys" easily.
*   **The "Femme Fatale" vs. The "Pure Sister":** The text sets up a dichotomy between Toyoko (the sensual, mysterious, wealthy seductress) and Miwako (the innocent, hardworking, suffering sister). Yoshitaro's rejection of his sister symbolizes his total immersion into vice.
*   **Economic Desperation:** The subtext of the story is the harsh economic reality. Money (the 100-yen bills) is the tether that keeps Yoshitaro returning to Toyoko, and its loss sends him spiraling into the cheaper, darker world of the red-light district.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
