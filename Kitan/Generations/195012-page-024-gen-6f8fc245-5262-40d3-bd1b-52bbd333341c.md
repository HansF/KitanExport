## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Be patient. Hey, you understand this meaning, right? —
Saying "Un" (Yes) pitiably, she turned bright red to the base of her neck and nodded, [he thought] "Ah, this girl is pure-hearted." Genkichi, not knowing she had lost her virginity at seventeen to a rubber factory accountant for 500 yen, was delighted, thinking if there’s a chance someday, I'll ask Shin-yan and officially take this girl. "I'm a single man and lonely, with no relatives. Unless I take a wife, being twenty-eight it looks bad," and so he was busy between working day and night and trysts with Yukiko.

"Gen-yan, it's no good anymore. The enemy has brought out microphones."
Since the Minami-sellers (rivals) appeared on a large broadcast with microphones, competing against them is pointless. "I have to quit soon," Genkichi, feeling desperate, lay down in frustration. Looking first at the city news page of the evening paper he had Yukiko buy, the "Tanuki Goten" (Raccoon Palace) in Utsunomiya jumped out at his eyes. What? What? I thought Tanuki Goten was a movie (katsudo), but does a real one exist? They've done something very clever.
"Hey, Shin-yan, it's a Tanuki Goten!"
"Are you talking in your sleep?"
"I'm not sleep-talking, open your eyes and read this paper. Paper, they made a fortune with paper, how about it, shall I do it too?"
"Good idea, but Gen-yan, any ideas for a source?..."
There is a source. Slapping his chest saying "Leave it to me," he jumped out and visited the old man of the bookstore "Kanten-do," who had become a regular patron at the "Paradise" bar and had told him "Come if you're in trouble," despite being sixty years old and having a liking for pop songs despite being bad at them.
"Uncle, isn't there a place to buy paper cheap? What are you doing?..."
Rather than hearing "Of course I intend to buy," he said "That's no good. Stop it..."
"This Kanten-do is doing it, but it's about to fail. Paper is circulating cheaper and cheaper, it's not the time for black-market selling. More than that Gen-san, if you say that, how about this business? —"
Restraining Genkichi who jumped at the sound of "good business,"
"Now, now, don't be in such a hurry. Actually, I'm putting out a book. It's that thing called a 'Kasutori magazine' popular now. Erotic magazines make money if you sell them well."
"I have no education, can I do it?"
"What are you saying? Of course you can, you'll do great. Just leave it to me. I'll take care of the novel plots. You are the publisher and editor. Hey, that's a big deal, right? You'll be the editor of a book, after all—"
Unable to wait for the completion, he flew there and liked the picture of the naked beauty. "Even so, Uncle, you're an impressive person despite your looks. You gathered such famous authors. Look at this luxury lineup."

Yoshikawa Eiji, Osaragi Jiro, Yoshiya Nobuko, Hida Tsuneo, Tamura Daijiro, Kojima Masajiro. Hmph, all first-class names I've heard rumors about. The characters are a bit strange? Is it a printing mistake? — No, it's impressive.
Without caring that the names were changed by one or two characters, Genkichi was in ecstasy and rejoiced.
"Hmph, it's written quite well."
The content was all similar erotic novels. For a manuscript fee of five yen per page, written instantly by part-time students: period, modern, detective, documentary—branded as "Masterpiece Collection of 16 People." Published as "Special Issue of Refined Humorous Tales."
After the cleanup of erotic materials, publishing with the resolution for adventure, it unexpectedly hit and sold well. Kanten-do made a net profit of 80,000 yen and put half in his pocket.
"Hey, Gen-yan, despite appearances, after paying all manuscript and ad fees, and considering 30% returns, the net profit is just under 40,000 yen. It's 20,000 yen each, but better than not making money. Take this—"
Riding the momentum, as the erotica got harsher, Genkichi's pocket grew with every issue. "There's no business better than this," he said while 20-30 thousand yen came in every month while playing. Then, from the authorities: "Come here for a bit"—"I don't know anything"—"Don't talk nonsense. Are you mocking the officer?" He panicked, but it was too late. He was severely scolded, and thinking it was a lucky find that he didn't end up in the lockup, he turned pale and flew home.
"Shin-yan, it's no good. ●●●● thick-skinned. From today, a change of business. There's nothing—"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"You’ve got to be patient. You know what I mean, don't you?"
When she nodded, her face flushing crimson all the way to her neck, Genkichi thought, *Ah, what an innocent soul.* He had no idea she’d surrendered her virtue at seventeen to a rubber factory accountant for a mere five hundred yen. Delighted by her apparent purity, he decided that if the chance ever arose, he’d ask his pal Shin-yan to help him make her his legal wife. Being twenty-eight and all alone in the world was starting to look pathetic. Between his daily hustle and his secret trysts with Yukiko, his days were a blur of activity.

"Gen-yan, we’re finished! The competition has started using microphones."
Now that the street vendors in the south were broadcasting over loudspeakers, there was no point in trying to compete. Genkichi, feeling defeated and desperate, flopped down and looked at the city news page of the evening paper he’d sent Yukiko to buy. Suddenly, the words "Tanuki Palace in Utsunomiya" caught his eye. *What? I thought Tanuki Palace was just a movie title. You mean there’s a real one? Those guys really pulled a fast one.*
"Hey, Shin-yan! Look, a Tanuki Palace!"
"What are you, dreaming?"
"I'm wide awake! Open your eyes and read this. They made a killing with paper. What do you think? Maybe I should get in on that too?"
"Not a bad idea, Gen-yan, but do you have a lead on where to get the stuff?..."
"I've got a lead, alright." Genkichi puffed out his chest and declared, "Leave it to me!" He rushed out to visit the old man who ran the Kanten-do Bookstore. They’d become chummy at the "Paradise" bar; the old man was sixty, had a face like a dried prune, and loved singing pop songs despite being tone-deaf. He’d always told Genkichi to drop by if he ever needed help.
"Hey, Pops, you know where I can score some cheap paper? What’s the word?..."
Before Genkichi could even finish saying he wanted to buy, the old man cut him off. "Forget it. Don't even go there."
"My shop is on its last legs as it is. Paper is flooding the market now, it's getting cheaper by the day. There's no money left in the black market. But tell me, Gen-san, if you're looking for work, how about this for a racket? —"
He held back the eager Genkichi. "Hold your horses. I'm going to start publishing. It's those 'Kasutori' magazines that are all the rage now. Erotic rags sell like hotcakes if you play it right."
"I don't have much schooling. You think I can do it?"
"What are you talking about? Of course you can! You'll be great. I'll handle the stories. You'll be the Publisher and Editor-in-Chief. Think about it—you’ll be a real editor! That’s a prestigious title."
Genkichi couldn't wait for the first issue to be finished. When he saw the cover—a painted nude—he was thrilled. "Damn, Pops, you're more impressive than you look. How’d you land all these big-name authors? Look at this lineup!"

Eiji Yoshikawa, Jiro Osaragi, Nobuko Yoshiya, Tsuneo Hida, Daijiro Tamura, Masajiro Kojima... "Hmph, all the top-tier names. Hey, aren't the characters in the names a little... off? Ah, probably just a printing error."
Genkichi didn't care that the names were misspelled by a character or two. He was on cloud nine. "Yeah, this stuff is written pretty well!"
In reality, the content was nothing but cookie-cutter erotic trash, churned out on the spot by students working for five yen a page—historical dramas, modern tales, detective stories, and memoirs, all branded as the "Masterpiece Collection of Sixteen Authors." After the government cracked down on obscenity, publishing this was a gamble, but it paid off. The magazine was a hit. Kanten-do cleared 80,000 yen in profit. The old man pocketed half and told Genkichi:
"Listen, Gen-yan, after paying for the writing and the ads, and allowing for thirty percent returns, we're looking at a net of just under forty thousand. That's twenty thousand for each of us. Better than a kick in the teeth. Here, take your share."
The money went to Genkichi's head. As the erotica grew more explicit, his pockets grew fatter. He thought he’d found the perfect life—lounging around while twenty or thirty thousand yen rolled in every month. But then came the summons from the authorities. "Come with us, please."
"I don't know nothing!"
"Don't play dumb with me. Are you making a fool of the law?"
Genkichi panicked, but it was too late. He got a royal dressing-down from the police. Shaken to the core and considering himself lucky he didn't end up in a cell, he flew home, pale as a ghost.
"Shin-yan, it's over. Those bastards have no mercy. We're changing businesses starting today. It was nothing after all—"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography**: The text follows the traditional Japanese vertical layout (tategaki), reading from top to bottom and right to left. There is a clear visual hierarchy with a large, handwritten-style title/catchphrase in the center-left: "ワイの家はんになってくれへんか" (Won't you become my wife?).
*   **Illustration**: A central line-art illustration depicts a man (Genkichi) and a woman (Yukiko) in a casual, domestic setting. The woman is reclining, suggestive of the "soft" erotic themes of the era's pulp fiction.
*   **Column Structure**: The text is divided into sections. The right side contains the narrative intro, the center contains the dialogue and the main "hook," and the bottom section contains the "business" aspect of the story.
*   **Typography Features**: Includes furigana (reading aids) for difficult kanji (e.g., 可怪しい/おかしい). It uses "iteration marks" like ＼／ (々) to denote repeated characters.
*   **Magazine Context**: The page number "(25)" is visible at the bottom. The paper quality appears to be the typical low-grade "rough" paper associated with *Kasutori* magazines.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Magazines (カストリ雑誌)**: The term "Kasutori" refers to a low-grade sake made from lees. It was said that these magazines, like the sake, would make you feel "sick" after three "cups" (issues)—referring to the fact that most of these fly-by-night publishers went bankrupt after only three issues. They thrived between 1946 and 1950, focusing on "the 3 S's": Speed, Sensation, and Sex.
*   **Post-War Economic Conditions**: The text mentions "500 yen" for virginity and "20,000 yen" profits. In 1947, 500 yen was a significant sum (a month's salary for some), while 20,000 yen was a small fortune, illustrating the hyperinflation and desperation of the time.
*   **Tanuki Goten (狸御殿)**: References the popular "Operetta Tanuki Goten" film series. The text mentions a "real" one in Utsunomiya, likely a reference to a contemporary news story or a scam.
*   **Censorship**: Post-war Japan saw a brief period of "freedom" before the GHQ (Occupational authorities) and the Japanese police began cracking down on "obscenity" and "subversive" content. The story ends with Genkichi getting "eye-balled" (scolded) by the police, reflecting the real-life risks of publishing *Kasutori* magazines.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ワイ (Wai)**: Kansai-dialect first-person pronoun ("I").
*   **家はん (Ie-han)**: A dialectal term for a wife or the mistress of a house.
*   **南賣仇 (Minami-uri)**: Likely refers to rival street vendors or merchants in the Minami (Southern) district of Osaka.
*   **カストリ (Kasutori)**: As explained above, cheap pulp magazines.
*   **闇賣り (Yami-uri)**: Black-market selling, a staple of survival in post-war Japan.
*   **有頂天 (Uchoten)**: Ecstasy, being on cloud nine.
*   **豚箱 (Butabako)**: "Pig box"—slang for a police lockup or jail cell.
*   **お目玉を蒙る (O-medama o koumuru)**: To get a severe scolding (literally "to receive the eyeballs").

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Cynicism and Survival**: The characters are motivated by quick money and survival. There is a distinct lack of "lofty ideals," typical of the *Buraiha* (decadent) literature style of the era.
*   **Pseudo-Intellectualism**: The gag about the "famous authors" with slightly misspelled names (e.g., 吉河英二 instead of 吉川英二) mocks the lack of education of the publishers and the gullibility of the public who wanted "prestige" with their porn.
*   **The Fragility of the "New Japan"**: The boom and bust of the magazine business reflects the volatile, unregulated nature of the post-war Japanese economy.
*   **Gender Dynamics**: The woman (Yukiko) is portrayed as "pure" despite her past, a common trope in male-centric pulp fiction that explores the blurred lines between "innocence" and "prostitution" in a poverty-stricken society.

*   **Tags**: Kasutori, Erotica (soft), Kansai-ben, Post-war Japan, Publishing Industry, Satire.
