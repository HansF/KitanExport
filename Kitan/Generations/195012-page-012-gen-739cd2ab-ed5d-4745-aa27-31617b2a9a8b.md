文政四年の六月になつて不遇にうちなだれて

八月の九日から、両國広小路に現

ようやく、女の身体から眼を離し福助は甲州松に言った。
「じやア、あつしが、ゆつくり掛け合いましよう、だが

「フン、それじや見世物にならねえじやないか」

「……貸して埋め合わせよう」と焦っていた。
「——そうだ、浅草だ。奥山へ何か一つ、目ぼしい物を掛けることにしよう」
と彼は思いついた。
当時の浅草奥山は、もちろん細工物の見世物が全盛を極めていた。
ゼンマイ細工、籠細工、人形細工、貝細工などをはじめとして、大仕掛けな麦藁細工の見世物があった。福助が真剣になって考え、思い切った奇抜な「糸瓜（へちま）細工」という案を出して、奥山の小屋を借りて興行することになった。
これは相当に好評であったが、まだ福助が期待したほどの利潤を上げないうちに、その小屋から出火してひとたまりもなく、焼け落ちてしまった。

文政四年の六月になって、不遇に打ちひしがれている「蜘蛛男」に、素晴らしい幸福が舞い込んだ。
それはペルシャ国から初めて長崎へ渡ってきた二頭の駱駝（ラクダ）であった。
この噂を聞き込んだ福助は早速長崎へ人を遣わして、一番最初に江戸で見世物にする権利を得たのであった。

八月の九日から、両国広小路に現れた怪奇な二頭の駱駝の姿は、大江戸八百八町の人々に驚異の目を見張らせた。
今までの見世物の中ではほとんど画期的な評判で、見物客は福助の小屋へ殺到して空前の大入りが続いた。
「さあさあ、これが、このたび遥々ペルシャ国から長崎へ渡った駱駝という珍しい獣だ！」
「雄が八歳、雌が七歳、仲の良いご夫婦だよ。背の高さはいずれも九尺三寸。背中が珍しいよ、背中に二つの山があるんだ」
「これを名付けて男体山、女体山。さあ、代金は見てのお帰り（後払い）、ほら、生きているよ〜」
評判を呼び、木戸番は声を枯らして客を呼んでいた。

儲かった金の顔を見て、素晴らしい勢いで盛り返してきた。
駱駝に蹴られて、両国でごろごろしていた仲間の香具師（テキヤ）は、懐のいい「蜘蛛男」を目当てに、色々な話を持ち込んできた。その中に、身体の一部にとんでもない奇形な部分を持った「章魚娘（たこむすめ）」という、まだ若く顔の美しい女がいた。
甲州松（こうしゅうまつ）を連れて、熊蜂の吉五郎という香具師の家へ下見に行った福助は、この女の持つ不思議を、好奇に満ちた目でいつまでも覗いていた。
「どうしますかね、親方？」いきなり松が言った。
「ううむ……」目も離さず、福助はうつろな返事をした。
「ねえ、親方、決めますかえ？」再び松は聞いた。
「決めることにしよう。決めるよ、どうしても」
ようやく、女の体から目を離し、福助は甲州松に言った。
「じゃあ、あっしがゆっくり掛け合いましょう。だがね親方、これほどの器量の女で不自由（不具）でなかったら、とても（手に入れ）られねえね？」ささやくように松が言った。
「ふん、それじゃあ見世物にならねえじゃないか」
と福助に言われて、「違いねえ、こいつは大儲け（大出来）だ」
甲州松は、月代（さかやき）へ掌を当てて、失笑した。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

To compensate [the loss], he was impatient.
"——That is right, Asakusa it is. To [Asakusa] Okuyama, one something, prominent thing, let's decide to hang (stage)."
Thus he thought of.
At that time's Okuyama, of course, craftwork sideshows (misemono) were reaching the height of prosperity.
Clockwork craft, basket craft, doll craft, shell craft, starting with these, large-scale straw craft shows existed. Fukusuke became serious and thought, a daring and novel "Sponge Gourd Craft" thing he devised, rented a shack in Okuyama, and it was decided to perform.
This was considerably well-received, but before Fukusuke raised the expected degree of profit, from that shack a fire broke out, and without a moment's resistance, it burnt down completely.

In June of Bunsei Year 4, to the "Spider Man" who was bent over in misfortune, wonderful happiness visited.
That was two camels that had crossed from Persia to Nagasaki for the first time.
Hearing this rumor, Fukusuke immediately sent a person to Nagasaki, and obtained the right to make them a show in Edo for the very first.

From August 9th, appearing at Ryogoku Hirokoji, the mysterious two camels' figures made the people of Great Edo's 808 towns open their eyes in wonder.
Among the shows until now, it was almost epoch-making popularity, and spectators rushed to Fukusuke's shack, and unprecedented "full houses" continued.
"—Now, now! This is, this time, having crossed all the way from Persia to Nagasaki, the rare beast called Camel!"
"Male is 8 years, female is 7 years, a harmonious married couple. The height is, both, nine shaku and three sun. The back is rare, yo! On the back, there are two mountains."
"Naming these, Mount Nantai and Mount Nyotai. Now, the fee is 'pay upon seeing and returning' (pay on exit). Look, they are alive!—" Gaining a reputation, the gatekeeper withered his voice calling customers.

Looking at the face of the earned money, he recovered with great vigor.
The fellow street performers (kaguya) who were idling in Ryogoku, kicked by the camels (metaphorically outdone), aimed at the well-pocketed Spider Man, and brought various deals. Among them, having an incredible deformity in a part of the body, a girl called "Octopus Girl," a woman with a still-young and beautiful face, existed.
Taking Koshu-matsu with him, Fukusuke went to the house of a performer called Kumabachi no Kichigoro for a preview; he was looking into the wonder this woman possessed with eyes full of curiosity for a long time.
"What will you do, Boss?" suddenly Matsu said.
"Uhh..." without looking away, Fukusuke gave a hollow reply.
"Hey, Boss, do you decide?" again, Matsu asked.
"Let's decide. I'll decide. For sure."
Finally, moving his eyes away from the woman's body, Fukusuke said to Koshu-matsu.
"Then, I will negotiate slowly. But you know, Boss, if a woman of this beauty were not disabled, she couldn't be [had]?" like whispering, Matsu said.
"Humph, then it wouldn't be a sideshow, would it?"
Being told by Fukusuke, "No mistake, this is a big catch."
Koshu-matsu put his palm to his shaved pate and chuckled.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Fukusuke was desperate to recoup his losses. "That's it! Asakusa!" he struck upon an idea. "I'll stage a major attraction at Okuyama."

At the time, the Okuyama district of Asakusa was the epicenter of *misemono*—spectacle shows. From intricate clockwork and basketry to dolls, shell-work, and massive straw sculptures, craftsmanship was king. After much serious deliberation, Fukusuke devised a novel show featuring elaborate "sponge gourd" (hechima) crafts. He rented a stall in Okuyama and opened for business. The show was a hit, but before he could turn a significant profit, a fire broke out. The stall was reduced to ashes in an instant.

It was June of the fourth year of the Bunsei era (1821). Just as the down-and-out "Spider Man"—as Fukusuke was known—was wallowing in his misfortune, a stroke of incredible luck arrived: two camels had just landed in Nagasaki from Persia.

Fukusuke wasted no time. He dispatched a messenger to Nagasaki and secured the exclusive rights to exhibit the camels in Edo. Starting on the ninth day of the eighth month, the sight of these two mysterious beasts at Ryogoku Hirokoji left the people of Edo's "808 towns" wide-eyed with wonder. It was a sensation unlike any before. Crowds swarmed Fukusuke's stall, resulting in an unprecedented string of sold-out shows.

"Step right up! Behold the rare beasts known as camels, brought all the way from Persia to Nagasaki!" the barkers cried. "An eight-year-old male and a seven-year-old female—a devoted couple! Each stands over nine feet tall. Look at their backs! Each carries two great mountains. We've named them Mount Nantai and Mount Nyotai. Come, see for yourselves—pay only if you're satisfied on your way out! They're alive, folks, truly alive!" The gatekeepers shouted themselves hoarse as the crowds poured in.

Flush with cash once more, Fukusuke’s fortunes were on the rise. Other street performers, who had been idling about Ryogoku, now flocked to the wealthy "Spider Man" with various schemes. Among these offers was a woman known as the "Octopus Girl." Despite her beautiful, youthful face, she possessed a startling physical deformity.

Fukusuke, accompanied by his associate Koshu-matsu, went to the home of a promoter named Kumabachi no Kichigoro to inspect her. He stared at the woman’s strange condition for a long time, his eyes burning with professional curiosity.
"Well, Boss? What do you think?" Matsu asked suddenly.
"Mmm..." Fukusuke replied vacantly, his eyes still fixed on her.
"Hey, Boss, are we taking her?"
"Yes. We'll take her. Definitely."
Finally tearing his gaze away from the woman, Fukusuke turned to Matsu.
"Alright then, I’ll handle the negotiations," Matsu whispered. "But honestly, Boss, if a woman this beautiful weren't 'flawed,' we'd never be able to get our hands on her, would we?"
"Hmph. If she weren't, she wouldn't be much of a show, would she?" Fukusuke retorted.
"You've got a point there! This is going to be a goldmine," Matsu laughed, slapping his hand against his shaved head.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Layout and Structure
The page uses a multi-panel, illustrated narrative format common in Japanese magazines or *gekiga* (dramatic comics) from the mid-20th century. The text is arranged in vertical columns, wrapping around several illustrations.

### Visual Elements
*   **Illustrations:** The top center features a sketch of a camel with a price tag (10 mon for adults, 5 mon for children). The middle-right shows a woman (the "Octopus Girl" or "Orudai") looking back over her shoulder. The bottom-left features a large, stylized portrait of Fukusuke.
*   **Typography:** The name "Fukusuke" (福助) is written in large, bold, brush-style kanji. The term "Dairi" (大入), meaning a full house or sold-out show, is featured in a red, stamp-like design at the bottom.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The use of large kanji for the protagonist's name and the "Full House" stamp emphasizes the themes of luck and commercial success. The camel sketch serves as a historical anchor for the narrative.

### Column Structure
The text flows from right to left across three main sections: the introduction of Fukusuke's failure, the success of the camel show, and the discovery of the new "Octopus Girl" attraction.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### Edo Period Misemono
*Misemono* were popular exhibitions or sideshows in the Edo period (1603–1867), often located near temples like Asakusa Sensō-ji (specifically the Okuyama area) or at major bridges like Ryogoku. Attractions included acrobatics, crafts, exotic animals, and "freak shows."

### The Camel Sensation (1821–1824)
The text mentions "Bunsei 4" (1821). In historical reality, a pair of camels (Dromedaries, though often depicted with two humps in art—the text says two humps here: "two mountains") arrived in Nagasaki in 1821. They reached Edo in 1824 and became a massive cultural phenomenon. They were nicknamed "Nantai-zan" and "Nyotai-zan" after the two peaks of Mount Tsukuba.

### Fukusuke (福助)
While Fukusuke is a common name, it is also the name of a traditional Japanese doll representing a big-headed man, considered a symbol of good luck and commercial prosperity. Depicting a promoter named Fukusuke is a play on this cultural symbol.

### Physical Deformities in Shows
The "Octopus Girl" (Takomusume) was a staple of Edo-period sideshows. These were often people with congenital conditions or cleverly disguised performers. In the context of the era, "unusual" bodies were commodified as entertainment.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Okuyama (奥山):** The bustling entertainment district behind the main hall of Sensō-ji Temple in Asakusa.
*   **Saiku (細工):** Craftsmanship or intricate handiwork. *Hechima-zaiku* refers to crafts made from the dried fibers of sponge gourds.
*   **Kidoban (木戸番):** A gatekeeper or ticket collector at the entrance of a theater or show shack.
*   **Kaguya / Tekiya (香具師):** Itinerant performers, street vendors, or promoters of sideshows. They often operated in a guild-like structure.
*   **Sakayaki (月代):** The traditional hairstyle for men where the front and top of the head are shaved.
*   **Daideki (大縮尻 / 大出来):** The text uses a slangy or archaic phonetic rendering "大縮尻" (pronounced similarly to *daideki* or referring to a "big contraction" in a slang sense), meaning a great success or a big hit. In modern terms, it's "O-deki."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

### Entrepreneurial Resilience
The story follows Fukusuke's journey from a failed venture (the fire) to a massive success (the camels). It highlights the "all or nothing" nature of the Edo entertainment business.

### The Gaze and the Grotesque
The dialogue regarding the "Octopus Girl" highlights the exploitative nature of *misemono*. Matsu notes that her beauty makes her "deformity" even more valuable as a product. Fukusuke's reaction is one of cold, professional calculation—he sees the human being primarily as a "show."

### Historical Authenticity vs. Legend
The text blends historical facts (the arrival of camels in the Bunsei era) with fictionalized characters and dramatic storytelling, creating a nostalgic yet gritty view of the Edo period.
