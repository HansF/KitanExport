## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

脂肪質の肉体の重味を感じつつ、そつ
と耳の處で囁いた。
「名古屋迄‥‥‥‥」
と女は胸を震はしつつ、握る指先を
絡ませて應えた。
「僕も名古屋です」
と、彼はうはの空の様に云う。
そして、
「眞夜中に着きますね。僕は名古屋
から更に五里程奥へ私鐡で行くんですよ
が、最終には間にあはないらしいんで
す。何處か泊る旅館はあるでせう
か？初めて行くので知り合いの旅
館もなくて‥‥‥」
「困りますわ」と云う意味も含めた。
「何ね。妾は幾等か馴染の旅館もあ
りますので妾が案内しましょう」
と、激情になるのを抑え細い神經
を動かしつゝ女は云った。
「寒いでしょう」
と、彼はオーバーを脱いで、女と
二人で頭から被った。被つたオーバ
の薄暗い中で、熱い息がともつてぐ
らぐらと眩暈する様な抱擁と深い接
吻が交された。女は自然と彼の脇の
下へ手を入れて、静に蠢く動揺に再
び彼は初戀の女を想い出した。
一流の旅館は仕舞つて居て、露路
裏の行商人が泊る様な粗末な旅館に
泊つた。
女は執拗に彼を求めた。無智と色
氣のシンボルであつた。だが、初戀
の女と同じ手練であり、密着せる肉
体の火花はあの昔の女と同じ深い情
を帯びていた。窒息しそうな雰囲気
に我を忘れた。

×　　　×　　　×

變に褐つちやけて見える薄暗い裸
電燈の下の汚れた傷だらけの畳の上
に、赤い血の滴がポタリ／＼と落ち
て女は深く呻いた。
それは神を忘れた傍若無人の振舞
だった。ぐつたりと彼は疲れて、よ
と眼を覺した時には女の姿はなかつ
た。
抱こうとしたが女の乳房もなくは
つとして、帳場へ下りると、朝早く
「あの人をよろしく頼みます。妾の
實の弟です。疲れて居ますからよく
休まして下さい」
と、云つて出て行つた由である。
彼は呆然として畳の上の血痕を視
詰めて唇をきつと噛みしめた。

それから彼は激烈なる戰爭の犠牲
者として、孤島ハルマヘラに送られ
た。偏一的な生活の中で常に淡い別

を唯獨り熱帯特有の色彩の濃い丸い
大きな月の下で行うより仕方がなか

あゝ、あの窒息しそうな氣持から
開放されたのは敗戰の報せであつた
内地に送られたのは一昨年の初夏

今に成つて思うのであるが、耳朶

家のない連中を呼んだ。
常務取締役の彼は女に不自由しな
い筈であるが、耳朶の例の如き女を
求めたが如何なる女もＶ字型であり
コの字型であつた。浮世繪にでもあ

じ切つた彼は、色々と女を漁つたが
耳朶の氣に入る女は居なかつた。
漲る男性の欲情によもやすると負

「ね！要子ちやん、小父さんの膝に

脂肪質の肉体の重みを感じつつ、そっと耳のところで囁いた。
「名古屋まで……」
と女は胸を震わせつつ、握る指先を絡ませて応えた。
「僕も名古屋です」
と、彼はうわの空のように言う。
そして、
「真夜中に着きますね。僕は名古屋からさらに五里ほど奥へ私鉄で行くんですが、最終には間に合わないらしいんです。どこか泊まる旅館はあるでしょうか？ 初めて行くので知り合いの旅館もなくて……」
「困りますわ」という意味も込めた。
「何ね。私はいかほどか馴染みの旅館もありますので私が案内しましょう」
と、激情になるのを抑え細い神経を動かしつつ女は言った。
「寒いでしょう」
と、彼はオーバーを脱いで、女と二人で頭から被った。被ったオーバーの薄暗い中で、熱い息がともってぐらぐらと眩暈するような抱擁と深い接吻が交わされた。女は自然と彼の脇の下へ手を入れて、静かに蠢く動揺に再び彼は初恋の女を思い出した。
一流の旅館は閉まっていて、路地裏の行商人が泊まるような粗末な旅館に泊まった。
女は執拗に彼を求めた。無知と色気のシンボルであった。だが、初恋の女と同じ手練であり、密着せる肉体の火花はあの昔の女と同じ深い情を帯びていた。窒息しそうな雰囲気に我を忘れた。

（中略）

変に褐色に焼けて見える薄暗い裸電球の下の、汚れた傷だらけの畳の上に、赤い血の滴がポタリポタリと落ちて女は深く呻いた。
それは神を忘れた傍若無人の振舞いだった。ぐったりと彼は疲れて、ふと目を覚ました時には女の姿はなかった。
抱こうとしたが女の乳房もなくはっとして、帳場へ下りると、朝早く
「あの人をよろしく頼みます。私の実の弟です。疲れていますからよく休ませてください」
と言って出て行ったとのことである。
彼は呆然として畳の上の血痕を見つめて唇をきゅっと噛みしめた。

（中略）

それから彼は激烈なる戦争の犠牲者として、孤島ハルマヘラに送られた。偏執的な生活の中で常に淡い別れ方――自ら女に教えられた動作を、ただ独り熱帯特有の色彩の濃い丸い大きな月の下で行うより仕方がなかった。
あぁ、あの窒息しそうな気持ちから解放されたのは敗戦の知らせであった。
内地に送られたのは一昨年の初夏の頃である。妻を娶れと父母に言われたが、十五の年に万城から教えられた耳たぶの瓢箪型の女性のみが彼は妻にすべき唯一の女であると信じた。
今になって思うのであるが、耳たぶの凹みが瓢箪型の女は情があまりにも激しく、その無技巧の技巧は深く男性の心情を抱き締めていつまでも離さないので、一度夫婦の契りを深くすると忘れられないのであった。
内地に還った後、ハルマヘラの復員者同士で専門の商事会社を作った。それは面白いほど富んで彼は宏壮なる邸宅を買い、親類の戦災者で家のない連中を呼んだ。
常務取締役の彼は女に不自由しないはずであるが、耳たぶの例のような女を求めたがいかなる女もV字型でありコの字型であった。浮世絵にでもありそうな瓜実顔の麗人も彼の興味外の女であった。妻帯を勧める父母と親類たちのきつい言葉に困りつつも、信じ切った彼は、いろいろと女を漁ったが耳たぶの気に入る女はいなかった。
漲る男性の欲情によもやすると負けてしまいそうになるのを耐えつつ年は過ぎた。
だが、彼は恐るべき現実を見たのである。それは彼の母の下の妹のたった一人の娘で、信州に疎開していた十四になる娘が、耳たぶの凹みが瓢箪型をしていた。
彼はそれ以来、どこの宴会にも行かなくなった。十四の娘は要子といった。この宏壮なる邸宅を買ったのは彼であり、ここでは王者の振る舞いにも家族の者は一言の反抗もしなかった。
彼はいつも書斎に入るとともに要子を呼んだ。要子は転校して今では横浜で、有名なクリスチャンの女学校一年生であった。家庭の者が不思議がるほどに、要子の物は金に惜しげもなく彼は買ってやった。

「ねえ要子ちゃん、おじさんの膝に乗る？ 乗ってほしいの、ね！ 今度は一番いいラケットを買ってあげるから……」
と言いつつ彼は膝の上に要子を乗せた。
要子は次第に顔を顰めた。彼の手をしっかり押さえたが、その動作の激しさに手を弛めた。彼女の頬は彼が少年の時のようにリンゴの頬である。その頬に急に血の気が引いた。激しく二人の体は揺れた。
そして季節が変わるまでに要子は死んだ。医師はこのシンデレラのような要子の、ある部分を見てあまりの痛々しさに驚愕したのであった。
要子のそれは瓢箪型の深いものであったが――。
しかし要子の死の翌朝、彼は要子の緋縮緬の帯を使用して首を括って死んだのである。
それは意外にも要子が彼の実の妹であったことが判ったからである。
（この事は兄妹も知らなかった。母が産むと同時に仮の葬式をしたように見せかけて要子を養女にやった）――子沢山の母は子供のない下の妹の養女に要子をやったことを知るとともに、彼は奔流のような痴情と、運命の皮肉に一瞬も転出できない死への緊張に導かれたのであったと言うよりほか仕方がないのである。

While feeling fatty-textured body's weight, softly at ear's place whispered.
"To Nagoya..."
and the woman, while chest trembling, grasping fingertips entwining replied.
"I also Nagoya am,"
and, he like in-the-air (distracted) manner says.
And then,
"At midnight [we] arrive, right. I from Nagoya further five ri (approx 20km) depth to by private railway go, but the last [train] to [be] in time not seem [to be]. Somewhere stay-at inn exists perhaps? First time going so acquaintance inn also without..."

First-class inns were closed being, back-alley peddlers stay-like crude inn at stayed.
Woman persistently him sought. Ignorance and sexiness's symbol was. But, first-love woman same skill being, adhering physical body's sparks that old time's woman same deep passion was tinged with. Suffocating-like atmosphere in self forgot.

Strangely brownish-burnt appearing dim naked lightbulb under's, dirty wounds-full-of tatami on top, red blood drops drip-drip falling woman deeply groaned.
That god-forgotten arrogance's behavior was. Limply he tired, suddenly eyes awakened time at woman's figure was not.

He dazed being tatami on top's bloodstains staring-at lips firmly bit.

After that he violent war's victim as, lonely island Halmahera to was sent. Monotonous life inside constantly faint parting-way—self woman by taught actions only alone tropics unique colors' deep round large moon under doing besides way was not.
Ah, that suffocating-like feeling from liberated was defeat's news was.

Now becoming think is but, earlobe's indentation gourd-shape woman passion excessively intense, that skill-less skill deeply male's heart embracing forever not-releasing because, once husband-wife's vow deepen then cannot-forget was.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Feeling the heavy, fleshy weight of her body, she whispered softly against his ear.
"To Nagoya..."
Her chest trembled as she spoke, her fingers entwining with his.
"I'm going to Nagoya too," he replied, his voice sounding distant and distracted.
"We’ll arrive in the middle of the night," he continued. "I have to take a private line about twenty kilometers past Nagoya, but it looks like I’ll miss the last train. Do you know of any inns? This is my first time, so I don't know where to stay..."
"That is quite a predicament," she said, her tone carrying a hidden invitation. "But don't worry. I know several inns quite well. I shall guide you."
Struggling to suppress a rising surge of passion, she spoke with a fragile, taut composure.
"You must be cold," he said, taking off his overcoat and draping it over both their heads. In the dim warmth beneath the coat, their breaths mingled, and they shared a dizzying embrace and a deep kiss. As she naturally slipped her hand beneath his arm, he felt a sudden, restless agitation; she reminded him vividly of his first love.
The first-class inns were already closed for the night, so they settled for a dilapidated place in a back alley, the kind frequented by itinerant peddlers.
She sought him with a desperate, relentless intensity. She was the very embodiment of crude, ignorant sensuality. Yet, she possessed the same carnal skill as his first love, and the sparks of their joining flesh carried the same profound, dark passion of that woman from long ago. In the suffocating atmosphere of that room, he lost all sense of himself.

***

Beneath the dim, flickering light of a bare bulb that cast a sickly brownish hue, red drops of blood fell—drip, drip—onto the stained and battered tatami mats. The woman let out a deep groan.
It had been an act of godless, reckless abandon. Utterly exhausted, he fell into a deep sleep; when he finally opened his eyes, she was gone.
He reached out to embrace her, but her breasts were no longer there. Startled, he went down to the front desk. They told him she had left early that morning, leaving a message: "Please look after him. He is my real brother. He's exhausted, so please let him rest well."
Stunned, he could only stare at the bloodstains on the tatami, biting his lip until it bled.

***

After that, as another victim of the brutal war, he was shipped off to the isolated island of Halmahera. In the crushing monotony of his life there, he had no choice but to reenact the motions of that faint, ghostly parting—the very gestures the woman had taught him—all alone beneath the great, round moon of the tropics.
The news of Japan's defeat was his only release from that suffocating existence.
He was repatriated in the early summer of the year before last. His parents urged him to take a wife, but he remained convinced that the only woman for him was one with the specific "gourd-shaped" indentation in her earlobe—a trait he had been told of at age fifteen in Manjo.
He reflected now that women with such earlobes possessed an excessively intense passion; their "artless art" gripped a man's heart so deeply they never let go. Once the bonds of marriage were sealed with such a woman, she could never be forgotten.
Back in Japan, he and some fellow repatriates from Halmahera started a specialized trading company. It became remarkably successful, and he bought a magnificent mansion, filling it with war-ravaged relatives who had lost their homes.
As a managing director, he should have had no trouble finding a woman, but he searched in vain for one with that specific earlobe. Every woman he met had earlobes shaped like a 'V' or a 'U'. Even beauties with "melon-seed" faces straight out of ukiyo-e prints held no interest for him. Despite the harsh pressure from his parents and relatives to marry, he remained obsessed, scouring for the right woman, but found none.
Years passed as he struggled against the mounting tide of his own lust.
Then, he was confronted by a terrifying reality. His mother’s younger sister had an only daughter, a fourteen-year-old girl who had been evacuated to Shinshu during the war. Her name was Yoko, and she had the exact gourd-shaped indentation in her earlobe.
From that moment on, he stopped attending all social functions. Because he had bought the mansion, he acted like a king within its walls, and no one in the family dared to oppose him.
Whenever he entered his study, he would summon Yoko. She had transferred to a school in Yokohama, a famous Christian girls' academy where she was in her first year. He bought her anything she wanted, spending money with an extravagance that baffled the rest of the family.

"Come now, Yoko-chan, won't you sit on Uncle's lap? I want you to, please! I'll buy you the very best tennis racket next time..."
As he spoke, he pulled Yoko onto his lap.
Yoko’s face gradually twisted in a grimace. She tried to push his hands away, but she eventually went limp under the sheer intensity of his movements. Her cheeks were bright red, like the "apple cheeks" he had possessed as a boy. Suddenly, the color drained from her face. Their bodies shook violently together.
Before the season could change, Yoko was dead. The doctor who examined the girl—who had lived like a Cinderella—was horrified by the sheer trauma he discovered.
Yoko's "earlobe" had indeed been of that deep, gourd-shaped variety.
The morning after Yoko’s death, the man used her scarlet crepe silk sash to hang himself.
It was only then revealed that Yoko was, in fact, his biological sister. (Neither of them had known; their mother had faked a funeral at the time of birth and given the girl away for adoption). His mother, having too many children, had given Yoko to her childless younger sister. Caught between a torrent of carnal obsession and the cruel irony of fate, he had been driven toward the tension of a death from which there was no escape.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese literary magazine style (likely from the mid-20th century). It features two columns of vertical text (*tate-gaki*). 
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style serif, commonly used in printing. Furigana (small phonetic characters) are used sparingly to help with the reading of specific kanji (e.g., 處 - *tokoro*, 應えた - *kotaeta*, 蠢く - *ugomeku*).
*   **Structure:** The story is divided into three distinct narrative sections separated by three "×" marks. This indicates time skips or shifts in setting (from the hotel, to the war/post-war search, to the tragic climax at the mansion).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "24" is centered at the bottom. The text ends with "(おわり)" (The End) in parentheses.
*   **Paper Quality:** The image shows aged, yellowed paper with some foxing (brown spots), suggesting it is a scan from an original pulp magazine or a cheap paperback (*bunkobon*) from the late 1940s or early 1950s.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Era (Late 1940s-1950s):** The story is set in the immediate aftermath of WWII. References to "repatriates" (復員者 - *fukuinsha*), "war victims" (戦災者 - *sensaisha*), and "evacuation" (疎開 - *sokai*) place it firmly in this period of national trauma and reconstruction.
*   **Halmahera:** The mention of Halmahera (an island in present-day Indonesia) is significant. It was the site of harsh conditions for Japanese soldiers during the war. The protagonist's trauma is rooted in his experiences there.
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** This story fits into the "Ero-Guro" (Erotic Grotesque) subgenre that saw a resurgence in post-war Japan. These stories often combined dark sexuality, psychological trauma, and tragic, often taboo, twists (like the incest reveal).
*   **Physical Fetishism:** The obsession with a specific earlobe shape (瓢箪型 - gourd-shaped) as a marker of sexual intensity is a recurring trope in certain types of older Japanese popular literature, reflecting a physiognomic approach to character and sexuality.
*   **Repatriation and Success:** The protagonist's quick success in a trading company reflects the "black market" economy and the rapid, often cutthroat, rise of certain businesses in the post-war ruins.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **五里 (Go-ri):** An old unit of distance. One *ri* is approximately 3.9 km, so 5 *ri* is about 20 km.
*   **私鉄 (Shitetsu):** Private railway.
*   **行商人 (Gyōshōnin):** Itinerant peddler/traveling salesman.
*   **傍若無人 (Bōjaku-bujin):** An idiom meaning "acting as if there is no one around"; behaving outrageously or without regard for others.
*   **ハルマヘラ (Harumahera):** Halmahera Island.
*   **瓢箪型 (Hyōtan-gata):** Gourd-shaped. In this context, it refers to a specific indentation in the earlobe believed to indicate a "passionate" nature.
*   **瓜実顔 (Urizane-gao):** "Melon-seed face"—an oval face with a high forehead and pointed chin, traditionally considered a mark of beauty in Japan (often seen in ukiyo-e).
*   **緋縮緬 (Hi-chirimen):** Scarlet crepe silk. A high-quality, vibrant fabric often used for kimono accessories like *obi* (sashes).
*   **痴情 (Chijō):** Blind passion, carnal lust, or infatuation.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Trauma of War:** The protagonist's inability to connect with women normally and his obsessive search for a specific physical trait are framed as psychological scars from his time in the war. The "suffocating" feeling he experiences links his sexual encounters to the atmosphere of death and defeat.
*   **Fate and Irony:** The core of the story is the "cruel irony of fate" (運命の皮肉). He spends his life searching for a woman who matches his fetish, only to find her in his own sister, leading to double tragedy (the girl's death and his suicide).
*   **Forbidden Desire (Incest):** The story plays with the taboo of incest, a common theme in darker post-war fiction. The reveal that both the woman in the hotel (who called him "brother") and Yoko were his sisters adds a layer of grotesque tragedy.
*   **Nihilism:** The story ends in total destruction—the death of the innocent girl and the suicide of the protagonist. There is no redemption, only the "tension toward death."
*   **Class and Power:** After the war, the protagonist uses his wealth to act like a "king" within his mansion, allowing him to prey upon his "niece" (sister) without interference, highlighting the moral decay possible in the post-war power vacuum.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
