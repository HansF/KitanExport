紐と秘密の園　　　　東京・R. M. (25歳・女給)

私は〔?〕るやうな秘密の生活をしてゐます。それは人には決して明かせぬ、恥か
しい、それでゐてうつくしい「紐」の園であります。
私がこの「縛られる」愉悦を知つたのは、或る画家の紹介でした。その人は、私を
見ると、直ぐに私の肉體の線に異常な執着を示し、遂には、全身を白絹の紐でぐる
ぐる巻にしてしまひました。
最初は苦しくて、恥かしさに死ぬかと思ひましたが、一たび抵抗が緩むと、不思議
な安堵と、この世ならぬ快感が私を襲ひました。
彼の「作品」となつた私は、裸體の上に、まるで蠶の繭のやうに白く固く鎮座して
ゐました。その時の私は、既に女給R. M. では無く、ただの「肉の塊」であり、彼
の性愛の供物でしかありませんでした。
そして、この秘密の遊戯は、今も私を囚へて離しません。

Ropes and the Secret Garden    Tokyo ・ R. M. (25 years old, Waitress/Bar Hostess)

I lead a secret life which is like 〔?〕. It is a shameful, and yet beautiful, garden of "ropes" that I can absolutely never reveal to people.
That I learned of this pleasure of "being bound" was through the introduction of a certain painter. That person, upon seeing me, immediately showed an abnormal fixation on the lines of my physique, and finally, completely wrapped my entire body in white silk ropes.
At first I was suffering and thought I would die from shame, but once my resistance slackened, a mysterious sense of relief and an unearthly pleasure attacked me.
I, having become his "artwork," was sitting firmly, white and hard, atop my naked body, just like a silkworm's cocoon. At that time, I was no longer the hostess R. M., but merely a "lump of flesh," and nothing more than an offering for his sexual love.
And this secret game, even now, captures me and does not release me.

## Literary English Translation

Ropes and the Secret Garden    Tokyo: R. M. (25, Bar Hostess)

I live a secret life, one that is [unclear]—a shameful, yet strangely beautiful, garden of "ropes" that I dare not reveal to anyone.
My introduction to this pleasure of "being bound" came courtesy of a certain painter. Upon seeing me, he immediately displayed an unusual obsession with the contours of my body. This culminated in him tightly wrapping my entire body in white silk ropes.
Initially, the suffering and the sheer intensity of the shame made me feel I would perish. But once my resistance faded, a profound, mysterious sense of relief and an almost supernatural ecstasy washed over me.
I became his "work of art," sitting rigidly—white and hard—on the pedestal of my own nude body, entirely encased like a silkworm’s cocoon. In that moment, I ceased to be R. M., the bar hostess; I was merely a "mass of flesh," an offering dedicated solely to his erotic desire.
To this day, this secret ritual holds me captive.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Letter / Confession (読者の告白 / Dokusha no Kokuhaku) or Fictional Reportage, designed to blur the line between personal experience and sensational fiction (a common *Kitan Club* strategy).
*   **Author Attribution:** Pseudonym (R. M.) coupled with specific demographic markers (Tokyo, 25 years old, Bar Hostess/女給). This provides the veneer of authenticity and targets the voyeuristic interest in the private lives of working women in the service industry.
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** The text is narrated entirely in the strong, confessional first-person voice ("私"). The editorial presence is limited to the sensationalized headline, location, and identifying details.
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in BDSM (Kinbaku), fetishism, the psychological duality of shame/pleasure, and the aestheticization of sexual deviance through the lens of art and modernism.
*   **Positioning within the Magazine:** Likely placed in the middle or back sections dedicated to sexual case studies, confessions, or fetish reports.

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **女給 (Jokyuu):** In the postwar Showa period, *jokyuu* were waitresses or bar hostesses in the *Mizu Shōbai* (nightlife industry). Their assumed vulnerability or moral flexibility made them frequent subjects for confessions and erotic narratives in pulp magazines.
*   **The Painter/Artist Trope:** The use of a "painter" (画家) as the initiator of the bondage practice is a common trope linking fetishism to modernist art and intellectual rebellion. It attempts to elevate the taboo act of BDSM/objectification to an aesthetic or intellectual pursuit, distinguishing it from simple vice.
*   **紐 (Rope) and Kinbaku:** The detailed description of being wrapped "ぐるぐる巻" (tightly wrapped) in white silk ropes, resulting in a "蚕の繭" (silkworm cocoon), is a classic, aestheticized description of Kinbaku (Japanese rope bondage). This practice was being popularized and formalized as an erotic art during the era these magazines were published.
*   **Postwar Context:** The focus on shame, transgression, and the search for "unearthly pleasure" outside societal norms reflects the psychological turmoil and liberalization of sexual mores in post-occupation Japan, particularly within the urban avant-garde and subcultures.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **紐 (Himo):** Metonym for rope bondage (Kinbaku).
*   **秘密の園 (Himitsu no Sono):** "Secret Garden," a classic euphemism for a private, forbidden, or sexual space.
*   **愉悦 (Yu-etsu):** Ecstasy or profound pleasure; often used in BDSM contexts to denote the complex, psychological joy derived from submission or pain, distinct from simple physical pleasure (*kai-kan*).
*   **肉體の線 (Nikutai no Sen):** "Lines of the physique." A clinical or artistic phrase used to objectify the body's form.
*   **作品 (Sakuhin):** "Artwork" or "masterpiece." The final state of the bound body, signifying the objectification of the person into a passive artistic medium.
*   **肉の塊 (Niku no Katamari):** "Lump of flesh." The ultimate derogatory and self-deprecating description of her reduced, dehumanized state.
*   **性愛の供物 (Seiai no Kumotsu):** "Offering/Sacrifice for sexual love." Extreme objectification, positioning the subject as a ritual item.

## Themes & Subtext
*   **Aestheticized Sadomasochism:** The binding is framed not as crude violence but as a process of artistic creation, using the specific imagery of white silk and the cocoon simile to beautify the submission.
*   **Identity Dissolution:** The central narrative tension is the deliberate shedding of social identity (R. M., the hostess) to embrace pure physical existence ("lump of flesh"), a common fantasy of escaping societal roles through submission.
*   **Transcendent Pleasure:** The description moves rapidly from "suffering" and "shame" to "unearthly pleasure" (この世ならぬ快感), suggesting that the pleasure is only achievable through the total abandonment of resistance and the embrace of the taboo.
*   **Compulsion and Addiction:** The concluding sentence emphasizes that the secret ritual is not a past event but an ongoing force ("今も私を囚へて"), suggesting the addictive nature of the power dynamic.

## Content Classification Tags
*   Sexual Content: High (Detailed BDSM/Bondage, Objectification, Implied Sexual Context)
*   Violence: Low (Focus on non-injurious restraint and psychological transformation)
*   Coercion: Implicit (Initiation based on a male artist's obsession, resulting in total physical restraint)
*   Medical / Bodily Themes: Nudity, Restriction, Physical Suffering/Relief
*   Taboo or Illegal Implications: Highly specific fetish practice (Kinbaku), Confession of private deviance
