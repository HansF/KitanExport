(一) 貞操の代金
島田克郎

松島清子は、福徳生命の支配人付タイピストでもあり、いわば秘書格の位置にあった。そして、処女にあり勝ちな、冒険好きな無鉄砲さを多分に持っていた。だから時間中は真面目そうにキイをたたいていても、夜は毎日のように、映画を見たり、ダンス・ホールへ行ったりして暮していた。
そんな性質だったので、センチメンタルな恋などは、しようともしなかつたし、といつて、せつな主義的な火あそびをする程、大胆でもなかつた。それがいつの間にか、支配人の耳に入つていた。
「松島君。ちよつと君に折入つて話したい事があるのだが……」
と、ある日、二人きりの支配人室で、清子はラシヤを敷いた大きな机の前へ呼ばれた。
切り出されたのが、エメラルドクラブの話だつた。上品な社交クラブの、サービス・ガールにならないか、と言うのだ。募集すれば沢山あるが、あまり下品では困るし、楽しくなければならないし、それには、気心も知れている、あなたに来て頂ければ、申し分ない、という話だつた。サラリーは、一万円で、細かい収入をよせれば二万円は間違いないが、どうだろうかと、支配人は清子の顔をまじまじと見て言つた。
月給四千円の殺風景なタイピストと、華やかなクラブで二万円……バアやカフェーのウエイトレスになるのは嫌だつたが、そう言う所なら、と、考えるまでもなく、
「えゝ、行かして頂けたら……」
と、清子は即座に答えたのだつた。

「由美、帰りに僕の部屋まで来てくれ」
プロデューサーの戸上が女優部屋の扉ごしに声をかけて行つた。
（何だろう、近頃は成績が悪いので、又叱られるのではないだろうか？）
由美は不安に胸をふるわせて、急いで身仕舞を終えると、仲間の冷やかな視線を背に感じ乍ら、逃げる様に部屋を出た。
（もしかしたらクビになるのではなかろうか、今姿がクビになつたら……）
実際戸上は、スター級の四、五名を除いては、誰でもクビにするだけの実権を持つて居たし最近の由美には、クビにされても仕方がないだけの理由が、充分あつた。

「何を遠慮しているんだい、まあ掛け給え」
扉を開けたまゝで、おす〜している由美に戸上は快活な声をかけて、椅子をすゝめた。
「君こないだ支配人に給料の前借を頼んでハネられたそうだね」
「えゝ、アノー」
「いやいゝんだ、君の事情は薄々知つて居る、そんな事はどうでもいゝんだ。どうだい今でも金が欲しいかい？」
叱られるとばかり思つていた由美は、戸上の砕けた調子に戸惑つて、返答に困つた。
然し金の要るのは、本当であつた。たつた一人の兄が、肺病の第三期になり、市民病院の公費患者として死を待つばかりの状態になつて居た。
放出のストレプトマイシンを注射すれば或は持ちなおすかも知れないと云う主治医の言葉に飛び立つ思いで、早速支配人に、半年分の給料の前借を頼み込んだのだつた。然し、スターでもなく、殊に最近連夜の看病疲れから、ひどく成績の悪くなつている由美などに、前貸してくれる厚意もなく、剣もホロロの返答に、どうする術もな……（以下切断）

(1) The Price of Chastity
Shimada Katsurō

1
Kiyoko Matsushima was a typist attached to the manager of Fukutoku Life Insurance, and was in what one might call a secretarial position. And, she possessed a large portion of the adventure-loving recklessness common among virgins. Therefore, even though she hit the keys seemingly seriously during hours, at night, almost every day, she spent her time watching movies or going to dance halls.
Because she had such a nature, she did not even try to engage in sentimental love, and yet, she was not bold enough to play with fire in a hedonistic way. That [information], before she knew it, had entered the manager’s ears.
"Matsushima-kun. There is something I wish to talk to you about privately..."
So, one day, in the manager's office with just the two of them, Kiyoko was called before the large desk covered in wool cloth (rasha).
What was brought up was the story of the Emerald Club. He asked if she would become a service girl at an elegant social club. If they recruited, they would get many, but if it was too vulgar it would be a problem, and it must be pleasant. For that, if you, whose character is known, would come, it would be perfect—that was the story. The salary was 10,000 yen, and if you combined small incomes, 20,000 yen was certain; how about it?—the manager said, looking intently at Kiyoko's face.
A bleak typist with a monthly salary of 4,000 yen vs. 20,000 yen at a glamorous club... She hated the idea of becoming a waitress at a bar or cafe, but if it was such a place, then—without even thinking,
"Yes, if I could be allowed to go..."
Kiyoko replied instantly.

A few days later, Kiyoko, who had started working at the Emerald Club, at first thought just as the manager said, that idle rich people were gathering for business talks and meetings, but as one or two days passed, [she realized] it was a large-scale e... [text cuts off]

"Yumi, come to my room on your way out."
Toage the producer called out through the door of the actresses' room and went on.
(What is it? Recently my results are bad, so will I be scolded again?)
Yumi, her chest trembling with anxiety, finished dressing quickly and, feeling the cold stares of her companions on her back, left the room as if escaping.
(Could it be that I will be fired? If I am fired now...)
In fact, Toage held the actual power to fire anyone except for the four or five star-level people, and for the recent Yumi, there was plenty of reason why it couldn't be helped even if she were fired.

"Why are you being so reserved? Come, have a seat."
To Yumi, who was hesitating with the door open, Toage called out in a cheerful voice and offered a chair.
"I heard you asked the manager for an advance on your salary the other day and were rejected."
"Yes, um—"
"No, it's fine. I vaguely know your circumstances. Such things don't matter. How about it, do you still want money?"
Yumi, who had thought she would only be scolded, was bewildered by Toage's informal tone and had trouble answering.
However, it was true that she needed money. Her only brother had reached the third stage of lung disease (tuberculosis) and was in a state of just waiting for death as a public-expense patient at the city hospital.
At the doctor's words that if he were injected with released Streptomycin he might recover, she felt like leaping for joy and immediately begged the manager for a six-month salary advance. However, for Yumi, who was not a star and whose performance had become terribly poor due to exhaustion from nursing him every night recently, there was no kindness to give an advance, and with a curt refusal, she had no means to...

**(1) The Price of Chastity**
By Katsurō Shimada

Kiyoko Matsushima served as a typist for the manager of Fukutoku Life Insurance, a role that effectively made her his private secretary. She possessed that reckless streak of curiosity often found in young, sheltered women. While she appeared the picture of diligence behind her typewriter during the day, her nights were spent chasing excitement at cinemas and dance halls. Because of this temperament, she had little interest in sentimental romance, yet she wasn't quite bold enough for a truly dangerous liaison. Somehow, word of her nocturnal habits reached the manager’s ears.

One day, the manager summoned her to his private office. Seated before his massive, green-baize desk, he made his proposal: would she consider becoming a "service girl" at the Emerald Club? He explained that while it was easy enough to find applicants, the club required someone of class—someone refined, pleasant, and trustworthy. "Given your personality," he urged, "you would be the perfect fit." He dangled the carrot: a guaranteed 10,000 yen salary, which would easily reach 20,000 yen with tips.

Kiyoko compared her bleak existence as a 4,000-yen-a-month typist to the glittering life of the club. Though she had always looked down on barmaids and cafe waitresses, this sounded different. Without a second thought, she blurted out, "Yes, I would love to go."

A few days later, Kiyoko began her tenure at the Emerald Club. Initially, she believed the manager’s claim that it was merely a quiet haunt for wealthy men to discuss business. However, as the days wore on, she began to realize the club was a front for a massive, illicit...

**(2) The Naked Dancer**
By Shunji Tsukimura

"Yumi, stop by my office before you leave," Toage, the producer, called out through the dressing room door.

Yumi’s heart hammered against her ribs. *Is he going to scold me again? My performance has been so poor lately.* She hurried to finish dressing, feeling the icy, judgmental stares of the other dancers on her back. She fled the room like a fugitive. *What if I'm fired? If I lose this job now, everything is over.* Toage held absolute power; he could dismiss anyone who wasn't a top-tier star. And Yumi knew all too well that her recent failings gave him every reason to let her go.

"Don't be shy. Come in, have a seat," Toage said cheerfully as Yumi hovered nervously in the doorway. "I heard you asked the manager for a salary advance and got turned down."

"Yes... well..." Yumi stammered.

"Don't worry about it. I have some idea of your situation," Toage said dismissively. "The details don't matter. Tell me—do you still need the money?"

Yumi was caught off guard by his friendly tone. But the need for money was a cold, hard fact. Her only brother was dying of stage-three tuberculosis in a public ward. The doctor had told her that a course of "released" Streptomycin might save him, sparking a glimmer of hope that sent her racing to the manager to beg for a six-month advance. But Yumi was no star, and her late nights spent nursing her brother had taken a toll on her dancing. The manager had refused her with a cold, curt dismissal, leaving her with no hope and no way out...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The page uses a traditional three-column vertical layout typical of Japanese magazines of the mid-20th century. The text flows from top-right to bottom-left.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   The center of the page is dominated by a stylized title block for the series "Flowers that Open at Night" (*Yoru hiraku hana*). It features a hand-drawn illustration of a woman in a kimono and floral motifs, signaling a focus on "feminine" drama or erotica.
    *   The two stories are numbered (一) and (二) and placed in the top-left and bottom-right corners respectively, creating a balanced but somewhat cramped appearance common in cheap pulp magazines.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard Mincho font. The titles use hand-lettered or decorative fonts. Some furigana (reading aids) are used for difficult kanji like 羅紗 (*rasha* - wool cloth) or 刹那 (*setsuna* - momentary/hedonistic).
*   **Design Features:** Decorative borders separate the sections. The use of the term "Kyōenshū" (競艶集 - Collection of Competing Beauties) is a classic trope of *kasutori* (pulp) magazines, promising the reader stories of attractive women in compromising or dramatic situations.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Kasutori Era:** The text likely dates from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. This was the era of *kasutori* magazines—cheaply printed, sensationalist publications that flourished during the post-war occupation. They often focused on the "pan-pan" girls (prostitutes), cabaret culture, and the "dark side" of the rebuilding city.
*   **Economic Desperation:** Both stories hinge on the vast difference between "honest" low-paying work (a typist earning 4,000 yen) and "shadow" work (a service girl potentially earning 20,000 yen). In the post-war ruins, women often had to choose between starvation wages and the "water trade" (*mizu shōbai*).
*   **Streptomycin:** The mention of "released Streptomycin" (*hōshutsu no sutoreputomaishin*) is a crucial historical marker. Tuberculosis (TB) was a leading cause of death in Japan at the time. Streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against TB, was introduced by the U.S. occupation forces. It was incredibly expensive and often only available on the black market or through "release" from military/official stock, making it a common plot device in tragic dramas of the era.
*   **"Service Girls":** This was a euphemism for women working in clubs who were expected to entertain male guests, often blurring the line between hostess work and sex work.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **羅紗 (Rasha):** From the Portuguese *raxa*. A thick, wool cloth often used to cover desks in formal offices, symbolizing a certain level of status or "old-school" professional environment.
*   **刹那主義的 (Setsunashugi-teki):** Hedonistic or "living for the moment." A common philosophy in the nihilistic post-war years.
*   **折入って (Ori-itte):** Earnestly or privately. Used when someone has a serious, often secret, request.
*   **剣もホロロ (Ken-mo-hororo):** A four-character idiom (yojijukugo) meaning to be curt, blunt, or to give a flat refusal without any sympathy.
*   **前借 (Maegari):** A salary advance. For many workers in this era, this was the only way to cover emergency medical costs.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Fall from Grace:** Both stories depict women on the precipice of moral compromise. Kiyoko is tempted by money and glamour; Yumi is driven by the tragic necessity of saving her dying brother.
*   **Male Power Dynamics:** In both stories, a man in a position of authority (a manager, a producer) uses his power and the woman's financial vulnerability to steer her toward a "darker" path.
*   **The Facade of Respectability:** The Emerald Club is presented as "elegant" and "social," but the text hints at a "large-scale" illicit nature. This reflects the reality of many post-war businesses that operated in legal grey areas.
*   **Post-war Nihilism:** The characters are described as "reckless" or "waiting for death," reflecting the social atmosphere of a country struggling to find its footing after a devastating defeat.
