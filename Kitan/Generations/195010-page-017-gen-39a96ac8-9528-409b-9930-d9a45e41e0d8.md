## Output

```
This text is a fascinating example of mid-20th-century Japanese tabloid or "pulp" journalism, likely from a *kasutori* (dregs) magazine of the late 1940s or 1950s. It provides a "behind-the-scenes" look at traditional carnival sideshows (*misemono-goya*).

## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

**桃・色・セ・ク・シ・ョ・ン**

言う首が長く～～伸びるのである。
だが、この種明しは、極めて簡単即ち、二人の人間で一人に見せて仕事をしているのである。
一人の娘は、顔を着物の中へひつこめて、手だけ出して三味線を弾いている。又もう一人の娘は、その背後で、眞綿でこしらえた長い首を額からたらして着物の襟に入れ、顔だけ出して客に見せている。
そして伸びる時には、幕の中から順々に腰をのばし、梯子をのぼって首を引き上げるのである。

**物を言う生首**
大道小屋がけは例の通り、鉦や太鼓をどんがらがんと騒々しく打ち鳴らして、さも天下の一大事でも出来たような様子で、木戸番がかなり立てるというのも一つの常套手段。
「さあーい、南蛮渡り、吉利支丹伴天連の秘法だ。看板に嘘はない。斬られた娘の首が物を言う……そら～～斬つた、今が首を斬るところだ代は見てのお帰りー」
言いながら、綱を引き揚幕を五寸引き上げて、たかつている群衆に一寸なかり中の様子を見せる。
すると、どうやら大の男が、向う鉢巻で、白刃を閃かしているところが、チラリと見える。
そこで繪看板と口上の性急さにつけ込まれて、何がなし、ぞろぞろと中へ入るのが見物人である。
だが、看板に嘘の無い筈の首を斬ると称して少しも、そんな模様がないのが、この見世物の特徴と云おうか。入場者は先づ既に首を切られてしまったかと思われる十二三才の少女が、土間に置いてある高さ二三尺、疊半疊ほどの脚の三方を取り硝子ばりにした台の上に生首をのせて目をパチクリしているのを見るのである。
「えー、此の通り、台は硝子だ透きとおつている。何の仕掛もないところが南蛮渡り吉利支丹伴天連の秘法だ、切つた首が生きている。物を言う。ハイ……花ちゃんやい」
香具師の女は大抵花ちゃんに定つている。
「はあーーーい」
と哀れっぽい声で生首が答える。
「さあさあ、お客さんに唄を一つうたつて聞かせて下さい」
「あい……」
生首はすぐに何か安つぽい唄を歌うのである。
「ハイ、よく出来た、さ、パンをやろう」
世話人が口の中へ菓子を入れてやると、生首がにつこりと笑うという趣向。
此の見世物のからくり、反射鏡利用の硝子張りの中へ女の兒が首を出して入つているのだということは、昔はいざ知らず今では子供だつて、こんな事位知つている。
只、可哀相なのは、この女の兒長時間、箱の中に閉込められて小便を垂れ流しているというのが人の知らない楽屋の苦労である。

**幽霊屋敷**
先づ小屋をかけて、その中に池を掘り、橋を渡し、山を築きづきて一面に笹を植える。
その合間～～にいろ～～と珍奇な張子の人形、化物等を据えるのである。墓場があるかと思えば、番町の皿屋敷がある。安達ヶ原の鬼婆が居ると見れば魔の影がある。
さながら百鬼夜行の図を拵らえあげて、さて幕で蔽うて眞暗にして客を呼ぶのである。要所々々には人を置いて、来た客を脅す仕掛になつている。
客は十銭、二十銭と高い脅かれ料を払つて入場する。そしてさんざん度肝を抜かれて出場するのだが、人を喰つたことには、看板には、「一度胸鍛錬化物屋敷、弱い者も強くなる。強い者でも、この化物屋敷を無事に驚かずには通る者があつた代は拂わなくていい」等と書いてある。

「えー、この通り、台はガラスだ。透き通っている。何の仕掛けもないところが南蛮渡りキリシタンバテレンの秘法だ。切った首が生きている。物を言う。はい……花ちゃんやい」
見世物小屋の女は大抵「花ちゃん」に決まっている。

「あい……」
生首はすぐに何か安っぽい唄を歌うのである。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Peach-Colored Section**

...the neck called [Rokurokubi] longly stretches.
However, this secret-revealing is extremely simple; namely, by two humans, appearing as one person, they are doing the work.
One girl, pulls her face into the kimono, and putting out only hands, is playing the shamisen. Also, another girl, behind that one, hangs a long neck made of silk-wadding from her forehead, puts it into the kimono collar, and putting out only the face, shows it to the customers.
And when it stretches, from inside the curtain, she sequentially extends her waist, climbs a ladder, and pulls up the head.

**The Speaking Severed Head**
The roadside shack-setup is as per usual; gongs and drums "dongara-gan" noisily strike-sounding, as if a great event under heaven has occurred, and the gatekeeper shouting loudly is also one standard tactic.
"Come now, imported from the south, a secret method of the Christian Priests. No lie on the signboard. The severed girl's head speaks... look, it's cut! Now is the moment the head is cut. Pay on your way out!"
While saying this, he pulls the rope and raises the lifting curtain five inches, showing the gathered crowd just a little of the inside situation.
Then, somehow a large man, with a headband, flashing a naked blade, can be seen for a moment.
There, taken in by the painted signboard and the urgency of the spiel, somehow or other, the spectators shuffle inside.
However, though they claim to cut the head which shouldn't have lies on the sign, there is no such scene at all; that is the characteristic of this show. Entrants first see a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl who one would think had already had her head cut, on a pedestal placed on the dirt floor about two or three feet high, the size of half a tatami mat, made into a glass-sided box, with a severed head placed on top, blinking its eyes "pachikuri."
"Yes, as you see, the stand is glass. It is transparent. The fact that there is no trick is the secret method of the imported Christian Priests. The cut head is living. It speaks. Yes... Hana-chan!"
The woman of the showmen is usually fixed as "Hana-chan."
"Yesss..."
In a pitiful voice, the severed head answers.
"Come, come, sing a song for the customers."
"Yes..."
The severed head immediately sings some cheap song.
"Yes, well done. Now, I'll give you bread."
When the caretaker puts a sweet into the mouth, the severed head grins; that is the design.
The trick of this show, that a girl has her head sticking out inside a glass box using reflecting mirrors, is something that, whatever may have been the case in the past, even children know nowadays.
Only, the pitiful thing is that this girl is confined in the box for a long time, and that she is leaking urine is the backstage hardship people don't know.

**Haunted House**
First, they build a shack, dig a pond inside, put a bridge, build a mountain, and plant bamboo grass everywhere.
In the intervals, they set various strange papier-mâché dolls, monsters, and so on. If you think there's a graveyard, there is the Plate Mansion of Bancho. If you see the Hag of Adachigahara, there are demonic shadows.
Just like preparing a diagram of the Night Parade of One Hundred Demons, they then cover it with curtains, make it pitch black, and call customers. At key points, they place people, making a setup to threaten the incoming customers.
Customers pay ten sen or twenty sen as a high "scaring fee" and enter. Then, having their hearts pulled out (startled), they exit, but what is cheeky is that on the signboard it says, "Once-Chest-Tempering Monster House: even the weak become strong. Even the strong, if there is one who passes through this monster house safely without being surprised, they don't have to pay."

**The Pink Section**

...and so the neck stretches out to a great length.
Of course, the trick is remarkably simple: it is just two people working together to appear as one. One girl tucks her head inside the kimono and plays the shamisen with only her hands showing. Meanwhile, another girl stands behind her with a long neck made of silk batting draped from her forehead and tucked into the collar. She shows only her face to the audience. When it comes time for the neck to "stretch," she simply stands up behind the curtain and climbs a ladder to pull the head higher.

**The Speaking Severed Head**
As is customary with these roadside sideshows, they beat gongs and drums with a deafening "clatter-bang," creating such a stir you’d think a world-shaking event was underway. The barker shouting at the gate is another classic tactic.
"Step right up! An exotic secret from the southern lands, the forbidden magic of the Jesuit priests! Our sign does not lie! Behold the severed head of a maiden that speaks... There! It’s done! The head is falling even as we speak! Pay only after you've seen the wonder!"
As he bellows, he tugs a rope to lift the curtain just a few inches, giving the swarming crowd a fleeting glimpse of the interior. For a split second, they see a large man in a headband brandishing a gleaming blade. Hooked by the lurid signboards and the barker’s frantic pitch, the spectators shuffle inside.
The strange thing about this show is that, despite the promise of a beheading, there is no such performance. Instead, the audience finds a girl of twelve or thirteen—who looks as though she has already been decapitated—resting on a glass-enclosed pedestal about two or three feet high. There sits the "severed head," blinking its eyes at the crowd.
"Observe! The stand is made of glass. You can see right through it! The fact that there are no tricks is the secret magic of the Jesuit priests. The severed head lives! It speaks! Isn't that right, Hana-chan?"
In these shows, the girl is almost always named Hana-chan.
"Yeeees..." she replies in a pitiful, frail voice.
"Now then, won't you sing a song for our guests?"
"I will..."
The head immediately drones out a cheap little ditty.
"Good girl. Here, have some bread."
The handler pops a sweet into her mouth, and the head breaks into a grin. That’s the whole routine.
Everyone knows the trick nowadays—it's just a girl sticking her head through a mirror-lined glass box. Even children are wise to it. The truly pitiful part, however, is the hidden struggle behind the scenes: the poor girl is cramped in that box for so long that she often has no choice but to soil herself—a hardship the audience never sees.

**The Haunted House**
First, they erect a shack and fill it with a dug-out pond, a bridge, a miniature mountain, and a thicket of bamboo grass. Scattered throughout are various bizarre papier-mâché dolls and monsters. One moment you're in a graveyard, the next you're at the haunted "Plate Mansion of Bancho." Here is the "Demon Hag of Adachigahara," and there are spectral shadows.
Having created a literal "Night Parade of One Hundred Demons," they shroud the whole thing in curtains to make it pitch black and call in the customers. Staff are stationed at key points to jump out and terrify the guests.
People pay a "fright fee" of ten or twenty sen—quite a sum—to enter. They eventually emerge, utterly shaken. The cheeky part is the sign out front, which boasts: "The Monster House for Tempering the Heart: The weak shall become strong. Even the strong, if they manage to walk through without being startled, shall not be charged a single cent!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of standard Kanji and older forms (e.g., 眞, 繪, 拂). The kana includes "small" characters written at full size (e.g., つて instead of って), common in mid-century printing.
*   **Layout:** The page is divided into three vertical columns. The title "桃色セクション" is set in a decorative, horizontally oriented header at the top, enclosed in a border with folk-art style illustrations of figures and skulls.
*   **Visual Elements:** An illustration of a woman in a stylized, somewhat surreal pose (suggesting the *Rokurokubi* or "long-necked woman") occupies the bottom left, tying into the first paragraph of the text.
*   **Formatting:** Subtitles like "物を言う生首" (The Speaking Severed Head) are used to break up the text. The use of repetitive characters like "～～" acts as a dash or emphasis.
*   **Tone:** The writing is a mix of reportage and cynical "insider" knowledge. It debunking the magic while simultaneously indulging in the lurid details of the performers' lives.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Misemono-goya (Sideshow Tents):** These were mobile entertainment shacks common at temple festivals (*matsuri*) and shrines. They featured "freaks," illusions, and macabre displays.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term "Kasutori" refers to cheap, low-quality alcohol from the post-war era, and by extension, the "trashy" magazines that proliferated at the time. They focused on "3S" (Sex, Screen, and Sports) but often featured urban legends, folklore, and "secrets" of the entertainment world.
*   **Namakubi (Severed Head):** A classic horror trope in Japanese art and theater. The "speaking severed head" was a popular optical illusion using mirrors (the "Pepper's Ghost" principle).
*   **Christian Magic (Kirishitan Bateren):** In the Edo period, "Southern Barbarians" (Portuguese/Spanish) and Christians were associated with strange, foreign magic. Using this as a marketing hook for a sideshow is a lingering cultural trope from that era.
*   **Bancho Sarayashiki & Adachigahara:** References to famous Japanese ghost stories and legends (Okiku and the nine plates; the cannibalistic hag).

*   **種明し (Tane-akashi):** To reveal a trick or secret.
*   **南蛮渡り (Nanban-watari):** Things brought from overseas (the "Southern Barbarians").

*   **三方 (Sanpō):** A traditional wooden stand used for offerings, here used as the base for the "severed head."

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Cynicism vs. Wonder:** The author acts as a guide to the "gullible" public, explaining how the gongs and drums create artificial excitement, yet they also acknowledge the visceral thrill of being "startled."
*   **Exploitation:** The mention of the girl "Hana-chan" having to soil herself in the box is a stark, dark detail intended to provide a "realistic" and somewhat voyeuristic thrill for the reader, typical of pulp magazines of the era. It highlights the grim reality of the *misemono* life.
*   **Mockery of Authority/Belief:** Associating the tricks with "Christian magic" or "Jesuit secrets" is a playful way of making fun of old superstitions while using them as a marketing gimmick.
*   **Human Nature:** The text observes how people are willing to pay to be scared ("scaring fee") and how the shows exploit the crowd's "性急さ" (impatience/eagerness).
