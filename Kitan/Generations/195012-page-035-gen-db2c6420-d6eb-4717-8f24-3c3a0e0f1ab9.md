　自分でも薄くなつたとあきれていた胸でしたが、慎重に聴診器でなでまわしている医師が、心配そうに眉をくもらせながら
「うむ、これはひどい！」
　と呟いたときには、さすがにハッと息が苦しくなりました。念のために持つてきたレントゲンフイルムを明るい窓際で透かして、
「あす療養所へすぐ入りなさい、多分ベットが空いているはずだから、できるだけ早い方がいい」
　それきりむつとりと黙りこんで、カルテにむつかしい独逸文字の病名を書きこむ医師に、私は怖ろ〜聞きまじた。

「そう…、君の今の仕事はもうできないよ、まず五年はかゝるね、しかし、もうこれだけ空洞が大きければ、気胸をやつても」
　あとは言葉を濁しましたが、その一言は私にとって、死刑の宣告のように鋭くひびきました。そうして、私がこの泉南郡の山奥にある國立療養所へ寝台自動車で運びこまれてから、もう一年過ぎました。私のは極めて進行の早い奔馬性結核という病気で、医師が五年といつたのはほんの気休めなのです。このごろでは、腸にも咽喉にも結核が進んでいて、おそらく、私の生命は五年どころか、あと半年、いや二ヶ月も保ちますまい。

　もうはつきり覚悟は決めています。絶対安静をいい渡されて、看護婦にきびしく叱られながら、私は今あおむいたまゝで、一冊のノートに鉛筆で、この手記をつづつて居ります。書いたあとはきまつて、三十八度近い熱にうかされることも身に沁みて経験しながら、私は息を引きとるまでに、どうしてもこれだけは書き残さなければ死にきれまじん。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Pro baseball's famous pitcher and perpetual-girl
movie star scandal.

The Sweetness (Candy) of a Pro Baseball Player.

Erotic/Passion Novel
Flesh Elegy

By Hisashi

I
Even by myself, it was a chest I was amazed at how thin it had become, but the doctor, stroking it around carefully with a stethoscope, while clouding his eyebrows worriedly, said:
"Umu, this is terrible!"
When he muttered that, as expected, my breath suddenly became painful. Translucent against the bright window with the X-ray film brought for caution,
"Go into a sanitarium immediately tomorrow, probably a bed is expected to be vacant, so the sooner the better."
After that, sinking into a gloomy silence, to the doctor writing the difficult German-character disease name in the medical chart, I fearfully asked:
"Will it take a considerably long time?"
"Yes... your current work, you can no longer do it. First, it will take five years. However, since the cavity is already this big, even if we do a pneumothorax..."
After that he muddied his words, but that one word, to me, resonated sharply like a death sentence. And then, since I was carried by a bed-automobile (ambulance) to this National Sanitarium in the deep mountains of Sennan District, already one year has passed. Mine is a disease called galloping tuberculosis with extremely fast progress; the doctor saying five years was just a small consolation. These days, the tuberculosis has progressed to the intestines and the throat, and probably, my life, far from five years, will not last another half-year, no, even two months.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Pro-Baseball Star and the "Perpetual Virgin" Screen Queen: A Scandal.**

**The Pro-Baller’s Sweet Trap**

**An Erotic Novel: Elegy of the Flesh**
**By Hisashi**

**I**
I knew my chest had withered to a shocking degree, but when the doctor—carefully moving his stethoscope across my skin—knitted his brows in concern and muttered, "Good God, this is grim," I felt the air leave my lungs. He held my X-rays up against the light of the window and spoke without looking at me. "Get yourself into a sanitarium tomorrow. There should be a bed open. The sooner, the better."

He fell into a sullen silence, scribbling the name of my ailment in difficult German script onto my medical chart. I asked him, my voice trembling with fear, "Will it take a long time to recover?"

"Well... you can forget about your current job. It'll take five years at least. Though, with a cavity this large, even if we attempted a collapsed-lung procedure..."

He trailed off, but his words struck me with the piercing finality of a death sentence. A year has passed since I was carted off in an ambulance to this National Sanitarium, buried deep in the mountains of Sennan District. I suffer from "galloping tuberculosis," a particularly aggressive strain. The doctor’s mention of "five years" was nothing but a hollow mercy. Now that the infection has spread to my bowels and my throat, I doubt I have five months left, let alone five years. Two months, if I’m lucky.

I have made my peace with the end. Though the nurses scold me for breaking my order of absolute bed rest, I lie here on my back, scratching these words into a notebook with a pencil. Every time I write, I am seized by a fever of nearly 104 degrees, yet I cannot allow myself to die until I have left this record behind.

I must tear the mask off Sayuri Shimizu—the woman the public hails as the "Perpetual Virgin" of B-movies—and warn her fans of the predatory siren she truly is. Furthermore, I must reveal the truth behind the death of the singer Shizue Shiraki, who was said to have poisoned herself last winter out of "artistic despair."

Exposing Sayuri’s private life and the truth of Mrs. Shiraki’s suicide will surely delight the bottom-feeding tabloid journalists, and my name will flash briefly across the headlines. But I am a man who will soon be a cold corpse. By the time those reporters come hunting for me at this sanitarium, I will be nothing but a handful of ash in a small wooden box. Lying here on my deathbed, I have no desire for fame or money. I seek only a bitter revenge against that hateful enchantress of an actress, and to offer a sincere apology for leading the virtuous Mrs. Shiraki into the sin of adultery, which ultimately drove her to a tragic, unholy end...

**II**
Look at me now: a pale, shriveled thing, choking on my own coughs in the corner of a charity ward, discarded like a scrap of waste paper. You would likely never believe that I once stood five-foot-six and weighed 140 pounds of solid muscle—a star pitcher who sent tens of thousands of fans at Koshien Stadium into a roaring frenzy. But if you look at the name tag hanging by the head of my bed...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page uses a multi-layered headline system. The top box acts as a "teaser" (The Scandal), while the main title "Pro Baseball Player's Candy" is rendered in a stylized, bold, brush-stroke font.
*   **Genre Branding:** The vertical box "愛慾小説" (Erotic/Passion Novel) and "肉体悲歌" (Flesh Elegy) clearly mark this as *Kasutori* literature—sensationalist pulp fiction meant for adult entertainment.
*   **Illustration:** A line-drawing illustration depicts a romantic/intimate scene. The man (the baseball player) leans over a woman (the movie star). The art style is typical of the 1940s-50s, bridging the gap between pre-war romanticism and post-war realism.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard vertical layout. Notable is the use of "iteration marks" (ゝ, ゞ) and older kanji forms (萬, 國, 獨逸), which were standard in the early post-war period before the full adoption of the 1946/1949 script reforms.
*   **Layout:** Three-column structure with a decorative border around the title box. The page number "(36)" is at the bottom right.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **The Tuberculosis Epidemic:** In the 1940s and 50s, TB was the leading cause of death in Japan, known as the "National Disease" (kokumin-byo). "Galloping tuberculosis" (奔馬性結核 - *hombasei kekkaku*) was a term for a rapid, fatal onset. The setting of a "National Sanitarium" in the mountains was a common reality for thousands.
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** Named after a cheap, potent liquor made from sake dregs, these magazines flourished during the chaos of the post-war occupation (late 1940s). They specialized in "the three S's": Sport, Screen (movies), and Sex.
*   **Pro-Baseball and Koshien:** Professional baseball resumed shortly after the war and became a primary source of national entertainment. The narrator being a former "Koshien star" (the prestigious high school tournament) adds to his tragic fall from grace.
*   **German in Medicine:** Until the end of WWII, Japanese medical education was heavily influenced by Germany. Doctors wrote charts (*karte*) and diagnoses in German to maintain professional mystique and follow tradition.
*   **The "Perpetual Virgin" (*Man-nen Shojo*):** A marketing trope used for movie stars of the era (notably Setsuko Hara was called the "Eternal Virgin"). The story subverts this by claiming the star is actually a "femme fatale" (*yofu*).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **肉体悲歌 (Nikutai Erejii):** *Nikutai* (flesh/body) was a buzzword in the post-war "Nikutai-bungaku" (flesh literature) movement, which emphasized raw physical existence and desires over wartime spiritualism.
*   **五尺六寸 (Go-shaku Roku-sun):** Old Japanese units. Approx. 169 cm (5'6").
*   **十七貫 (Ju-nana Kan):** Approx. 63.7 kg (140 lbs).
*   **奔馬性結核 (Hombasei Kekkaku):** "Galloping TB." A metaphor for how fast the disease "runs" through the body like a horse.
*   **妖婦 (Yōfu):** Enchantress, siren, or femme fatale.
*   **非業の最後 (Higyō no saigo):** An unnatural or violent end; a tragic death.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **The Fall from Grace:** A common trope where a hero of the "Golden Age" (Koshien) is brought low by the vices of the "New Age" (urban scandals and disease).
*   **Nihilism and Death:** The narrator is already "dead" socially and physically, giving him the "freedom" to speak the truth without fear of consequences.
*   **Misogyny and the Femme Fatale:** The narrative places the blame for the man's downfall and the singer's suicide on the "evil" movie star. It reflects the post-war anxiety regarding the changing roles and perceived power of women in the entertainment industry.
*   **Class and Poverty:** The contrast between the "shining" world of movies/sports and the "charity ward" (*shiryo-byoto*) where the poor were sent to die.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Novel, Kasutori Literature.
*   **Tags:** Scandal, Baseball, Tuberculosis, Movie Stars, Revenge, Confession, Melodrama, Post-war Japan.
