## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

まるだらうと高をくゝつていたからである。然も先刻は充分凄味を利かせて言つた心算なのに、と思ふとあきは急に憎しさに目を輝かせた。「ぢや、謝らない心算ね、わたし達の制裁を受ける心算ね、」
「だつて謝る理由が何処にあるの？」
真弓は言つた。
「生意気ね」
横合いからひさが取つて、
「あんたは一体何人の妹を持つてるの女同志でいちゃいちゃして、今迄この学校にそんなけがらわしいことはなかつたわ、あんたが来てからよ、」
「わたし妹だの何だのつて言われても何にも身に覚えはないわ、たゞなつかから遊んでやつてるだけよ」「ちやどらしても悪くないと言い張るのね」
「ちつとも悪くないと思うわ」
蒼ざめた顔乍ら真弓も強硬であつた「悪かつたと言わせて見せるわ」
とあきの手が真弓の頬で激しく鳴つた。真弓はよろめいたが、それでも「何すんのよ、乱暴な、」
と反抗の気配を見せると、後から近子が髪を掴み其処へねぢ倒し、傍に落ちていた繩で真弓の腕をねぢ上げて後手に縛つた。
「何すんのよ、止してよ、どうしてこんな馬鹿な真似するのよ、畜生」
真弓は必死に暴れたが、到底かなう筈もなかつた。やがて真弓を縛つた繩は天井の梁を通されると、真弓の足が少し床を離れて吊り下げられた。あきは平然と真弓の前に立つた。
「悪かつたと思わないの、」
流石の真弓もその尋常でない暴力に脅えてか今迄のように口を開こうとしなかつた。
「どうなのよ」
ピシリとあきが真弓の頬をぶつ、二つ三つ、自由を失われて、なすがまゝの恰好の真弓は、顔をそらせてあきの手を逃れようと焦つたが、あきの手は正確であつた。
「ど、どうして私をこんな目に遇わすの」
真弓は必死に絶叫したが、あきには問答無用であつた。
「よろし、強情をはるのね」
あきは鞄の中から革バンドを引き出した。いつか不良のチンピラが酒を飲んだ後で、あきの家に忘れて行つたものである。チャラ／＼金具もついていた。それを見ると真弓は恐怖に身体を硬ばらせて、見栄外聞も忘れてしまつたかのように、
「謝るわ、堪忍してよ、私が悪かつたのよ」

まるだろうと高をくくっていたからである。しかも先刻は十分に凄みを利かせて言ったつもりなのに、と思うとあきは急に憎しみに目を輝かせた。「じゃあ、謝らないつもりね、私たちの制裁を受けるつもりね」
「だって謝る理由がどこにあるの？」
真弓は言った。
「生意気ね」
横合いからひさが割って入って、
「あんたは一体何人の妹を持っているの。女同士でいちゃいちゃして、今までこの学校にそんな汚らわしいことはなかったわ。あんたが来てからよ」
「私、妹だの何だのって言われても何にも身に覚えはないわ。ただ懐くから遊んでやってるだけよ」
「どうしても悪くないと言い張るのね」
「ちっとも悪くないと思うわ」
蒼ざめた顔ながら真弓も強硬であった。
「悪かったと言わせて見せるわ」
と、あきの手が真弓の頬で激しく鳴った。真弓はよろめいたが、それでも「何すんのよ、乱暴な」
と反抗の気配を見せると、後ろから近子が髪を掴みそこへねじ倒し、傍に落ちていた縄で真弓の腕をねじ上げて後ろ手に縛った。
「何すんのよ、やめてよ、どうしてこんな馬鹿な真似するのよ、ちくしょう」
真弓は必死に暴れたが、到底かなうはずもなかった。やがて真弓を縛った縄は天井の梁を通されると、真弓の足が少し床を離れて吊り下げられた。あきは平然と真弓の前に立った。
「悪かったと思わないの？」
流石の真弓もその尋常でない暴力に怯えてか、今までのように口を開こうとしなかった。
「どうなのよ」
ピシリとあきが真弓の頬を打つ。二つ、三つ。自由を失われて、なすがままの状態の真弓は、顔をそらせてあきの手を逃れようと焦ったが、あきの手は正確であった。
「ど、どうして私をこんな目に合わせるの」
真弓は必死に絶叫したが、あきには問答無用であった。
「よろしい、強情を張るのね」
あきは鞄の中から革ベルトを引き出した。いつか不良のチンピラが酒を飲んだ後で、あきの家に忘れて行ったものである。チャラチャラと金具もついていた。それを見ると真弓は恐怖に体を硬直させて、見栄も外聞も忘れてしまったかのように、
「謝るわ、堪忍してよ、私が悪かったのよ」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

It was because [she] took [her] lightly, thinking [she] would yield. Moreover, thinking that [she] had just spoken with sufficient intimidation, Aki suddenly made her eyes shine with hatred. "Then, you don't intend to apologize? You intend to receive our 'sanction' (punishment), don't you?"
"But where is the reason to apologize?"
Mayumi said.
"How cheeky,"
Hisa broke in from the side,
"Just how many 'younger sisters' do you have? Flirting between women... until now, there was never such a filthy thing in this school. It's since you came."
"Even if I'm told about 'sisters' or whatever, I have no memory of such things. It's just that they are attached to me, so I'm just playing with them."
"So you persist in saying you aren't wrong at all?"
"I think I'm not wrong in the slightest."
Despite her pale face, Mayumi was also firm.
"I'll make you say you were wrong,"
And Aki's hand sounded loudly on Mayumi's cheek. Mayumi staggered, but even then, when she showed signs of resistance saying "What are you doing! This is violent!", Chikako grabbed her hair from behind, twisted her down right there, and with a rope that was lying nearby, twisted Mayumi's arms up and tied them behind her back.
"What are you doing! Stop it! Why are you doing such a stupid thing! Damn it!"
Mayumi struggled desperately, but there was no way she could prevail. Eventually, the rope that bound Mayumi was passed over a beam in the ceiling, and Mayumi's feet were suspended slightly off the floor. Aki stood calmly in front of Mayumi.
"Don't you think you were wrong?"
Even the brave Mayumi, perhaps frightened by that extraordinary violence, did not try to open her mouth as she had before.
"How about it?"
*Pishiri*—Aki strikes Mayumi's cheek. Two, three times. Having lost her freedom and being in a state of 'as-is,' Mayumi frantically turned her face away to escape Aki's hand, but Aki's hand was accurate.
"W-why are you putting me through this?"
Mayumi screamed desperately, but for Aki, it was 'no use talking.'
"Fine, so you'll be stubborn."
Aki pulled a leather belt out of her bag. It was something a delinquent punk had left at Aki's house after drinking sake some time ago. It had jangling metal fittings. Seeing that, Mayumi stiffened her body with terror, and as if she had forgotten all pride and appearance:
"I'll apologize! Forgive me! I was the one who was wrong!"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Aki had assumed Mayumi would crumble easily. Infuriated that her previous threats hadn't been enough to break her, Aki’s eyes glinted with a sudden, sharp malice. "So, you have no intention of apologizing? You're prepared to face our 'discipline' then?"
"Why should I apologize? I haven't done anything," Mayumi retorted.
"How arrogant," Hisa interjected from the side. "Just how many 'little sisters' do you plan on collecting? All this flirting and carrying on between girls... this school was never so filthy until you arrived."
"I don't know anything about this 'sister' business," Mayumi said. "If the younger girls follow me around, I just play along. That’s all."
"So you’re going to insist you've done nothing wrong?"
"I know I haven't."
Though her face was deathly pale, Mayumi remained defiant.
"I’ll make you admit it," Aki hissed, her palm cracking sharply across Mayumi’s cheek. Mayumi staggered, but when she tried to fight back, shouting "Stop it! You're being insane!", Chikako lunged from behind. She grabbed Mayumi by the hair, threw her to the floor, and used a discarded length of rope to wrench Mayumi’s arms behind her back and bind them tight.
"Let me go! What is wrong with you people? Why are you doing this? Damn you!"
Mayumi thrashed wildly, but she was no match for them. Before long, the rope binding her was thrown over a ceiling beam, and she was hoisted up until her toes barely brushed the floor. Aki stood before her, her expression chillingly calm.
"Still don't think you're wrong?"
Even Mayumi’s resolve began to crack. Terrified by the sheer, cold brutality of it all, she remained silent.
"Well?"
*Smack.* Aki struck her again. Then again. Helpless and dangling, Mayumi tried to twist her face away, but Aki’s blows were clinical and precise.
"Wh-why... why are you doing this to me?" Mayumi shrieked.
But Aki was beyond listening. "Fine. If you want to be stubborn..."
Aki reached into her bag and pulled out a heavy leather belt—a trophy left behind by some street punk who had been drinking at her house. The metal buckle clattered ominously. At the sight of it, Mayumi’s entire body went rigid with primal fear. Shaken to her core and her pride utterly shattered, she finally broke.
"I'll apologize! Please, stop! I was wrong! It was all my fault!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is a standard vertical-text (*tategaki*) layout typical of Japanese magazines or light novels from the mid-20th century. It is divided into two main columns of text.
*   **Typography:** The text utilizes a mix of Kanji and Kana with *furigana* (reading aids) for some of the more difficult or specific terms (e.g., "凄味" / *sugami*). It uses traditional punctuation like quotation marks (「 」) and repetition marks (ゝ, 々).
*   **Illustration:** A large, evocative ink-wash or line-art illustration occupies the top half of the page. It depicts the climax of the scene: Mayumi is bound and on the floor, while the other girls stand over her in positions of dominance. The clothing (blouses with ties, skirts) suggests a school uniform or schoolgirl fashion of the early post-war era.
*   **Signature:** There is a signature on the left side of the illustration, likely "玲子" (Reiko), the artist's name.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "(23)" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a serialized story or a collection of short stories.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Based on the orthography (use of "だらう" instead of "だろう") and the fashion in the illustration, this likely dates from the **late 1940s to early 1950s**.
*   **"S" Culture (Class S):** The dialogue mentions "sisters" (*imōto*) and "flirting between women" (*onna-dōshi de icha-icha*). This refers to the "Class S" (S stands for sister) phenomenon in Japanese girls' schools, where intense, romantic but often platonic relationships between older and younger students were common. However, the text portrays this in a "filthy" or "impure" (*kegarawashii*) light, suggesting a more transgressive or delinquent interpretation of these bonds.
*   **Post-war Juvenile Delinquency:** The mention of a "leather belt left by a *chinpira* (low-level punk/thug)" reflects post-war anxieties about juvenile delinquency and the breakdown of traditional morals. The belt serves as a symbol of the "outside world" of violence infiltrating the school environment.
*   **Seisai (制裁):** This word, meaning "sanction" or "punishment," was often used in Japanese schools or gangs to describe extrajudicial "discipline" meted out by peers to those who broke unwritten social codes.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **高をくくる (Taka o kukuru):** To underestimate someone; to take someone lightly.
*   **凄味を利かせる (Sugami o kikaseru):** To use an intimidating air or a threatening tone.
*   **制裁 (Seisai):** Sanction, punishment, or discipline. Used here as a euphemism for bullying/torture.
*   **生意気 (Namaiki):** Cheeky, impertinent, snotty, or arrogant. A common trigger for bullying in Japanese social contexts.
*   **身に覚えはない (Mi ni oboe wa nai):** To have no recollection of doing something; to be innocent of the charges.
*   **チンピラ (Chinpira):** A low-level hoodlum, punk, or delinquent.
*   **見栄外聞 (Mie-gaibun):** Pride and reputation; appearance in the eyes of others.
*   **堪忍して (Kannin shite):** Forgive me; have mercy. A slightly older or more dramatic way of asking for forgiveness.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Internalized Misogyny:** The aggressors use terms like "filthy" to describe female-female bonds, showing a harsh policing of gender and social norms among the girls themselves.
*   **Power and Submission:** The core of the text is a power struggle. Mayumi’s initial defiance is met with escalating physical violence (slapping, binding, hanging) until her spirit is broken by the threat of even greater pain (the belt).
*   **Eroticism and Cruelty:** The scene contains elements of *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque) which was a popular subgenre in Japanese magazines. The depiction of bound girls (*bondage*) in a school setting was a common trope in "pulp" magazines of that era, catering to a specific voyeuristic interest.
*   **Social Displacement:** The conflict stems from Mayumi being a "newcomer" who has disrupted the existing social hierarchy of the school.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serialized Novel, Pulp Fiction.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Bullying, Schoolgirl, Delinquency, Violence, Bondage (Mild/Thematic), Melodrama, Power Struggle, Post-war Japan.
