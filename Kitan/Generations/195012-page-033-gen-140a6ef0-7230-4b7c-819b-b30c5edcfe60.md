## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

「……あんだから……」
トランプ札位の番号札を押しつけられた僕にいついて、前列の四人にすばやく札を渡すと、
「さあ、中へ入りつしやい！」
五人をつれこんだ。バラックの中は板壁でまわり一面、人相やら手相やらの圖をポスター代りにべたべた貼りつけ、正面に机と椅子、机の上にはぜい竹、算木、天眼鏡、それに虫の食つた分厚い易學書が積みあげてあり、どつしりと椅子に陣どつている大先生というのが、つるつるのちやぴん頭に長いあごひげを悠々としごいている。五人をつれこんだ男が
「では案內料としてお一人三十円ずつ」
ぬつと手をさし出した。いやおう言わさずしめて百五十円まきあげた男は、大先生にうやうやしくおじぎすると、すぐ外へ出て行つた。やがて、さつきの通り
「……さて、通行の方々」
と又くりかえしている聲が聞えてきた。
板壁の前の粗末な長椅子に目白押しに腰かけている五人へ大先生は、おほんともつたいぶつた咳をすると、軽く僕を招いた。あとは例の通り、わかつたようなわからないような御託宣よろしく、十分も立つと、
「普通鑑定はこれまで、料金は五百円いたゞくどうじやな、御希望とあらば特別鑑定もいたそう、ええと、料金は千円、二千円、五千円とあるが―」
三十円は案内料、鑑定料は五百円、こんちくしようめ、まんまとペテンにかけやがつた。
「ふむ、なにをもじもじなさつとるかの、はゝあ、失礼じゃが五百円のお持ち合せはないらしいのう、三百円、いや二百円に特別に勉強しときませず」
さすがは大先生、こつちのふところ具合もお見透しである。二百円を机の上においた僕は、もう秋というのに、腋の下にびつしより冷汗をかいて飛び出した。しかし、どうもふしぎであるあの大先生にはどこかで見たことがあるぞ……あつ、そうか。僕は、いちばんはじめ、易者の説明を一人で立つて聞いていて、見物人がふえた時分にいつのまにか消え失せていたあのちやぴん頭にあごひげのおやじこそ、いま二百円まきあげた大先生その人であることに気がついたのである！

**第三話　艶画奇譚**
戦災で丸焼けになつた昔なつかしい松島遊廓。それがいつの間にか、元の古巣から三丁あまり西、茨住吉神社北門前一帯に、特殊喫茶という名前で復活していた。
だいたい焼ける前の松島というと、ころは、築港へ寄港する船の船員とか、木津川、安治川を上下する船のオツサンが、飛田や今里よりもちょっとガラがわるい。地まわりのチン公が多いし、ハッタリばくに斬つた張ったの喧嘩も始終のことであつた。
それに例のY画、Y写真賣りの多いことも知る人ぞ知るで、僕みたいな温厚善良な？紳士は遊びに行くのをためらつたものである。
しかし、気分一轉、茨住吉の方へ移つたのだし、特殊喫茶と名も変つたのだから、前みたいにえげつないことはあるまい、まあ一度見物に……（にやにや笑いなさんな、ほんまに見物だけですがな）出かけた。
市電は本田二丁目で降りる。北は華やかな……。

（下部セリフ）
あんた――あ――。しっかりしとくなはれ。
地底から呼ぶ様なきれぎれの叫びにフト眼ざめると、白いベツトに横いかぶさる様に、新やんとお雪が懸命に覗き込んでいた。
おわいは、すると死ねなかつたんやな。
グッと言いものが、こみ上げて、新やんがそばから、
「なあ、源やん。悪い夢や。長い――悪い夢を見て来たんや。凡人は凡人らしく、一生平凡に暮すのが一番しあわせやで。女房可愛がつて、子供の二三人にもとりかこまれて平和は暮せたらそれが一番えんや。なあ、源やん、力合せてもう一ぺん出直そ―」
ようわかつた――と手を振って、
「今度こそ、あんな危ない橋渡らんと、まともに暮したら。金儲け許りが世渡りやない。人間の愛情が一番肝心じゃやつたんや……。
あゝえらい腹が減つて。どこかでチャルメラの笛がきこえてるわ。ウン中華そば喰いたいな―。もうろかく死ねんわいと思ひ乍ら、
―お雪、たのむぞ―
と手を握って源吉は再び、今度は安らかな深い――眠りにと誘い込まれていつた―。

「……あんだから……」
トランプ札位の番号札を押しつけられた僕に続いて、前列の四人に素早く札を渡すと、
「さあ、中へ入りなさい！」
五人を連れ込んだ。バラックの中は板壁で周り一面、人相やら手相やらの図をポスター代わりにべたべた貼りつけ、正面に机と椅子、机の上にはぜい竹（筮竹）、算木、天眼鏡、それに虫の食った分厚い易学書が積み上げてあり、どっしりと椅子に陣取っている「大先生」という男が、つるつるのちゃぴん頭（禿頭）に長いあごひげを悠々としごいている。五人を連れ込んだ男が
「では案内料としてお一人三十円ずつ」
ぬっと手を差し出した。否応言わさず締めて百五十円巻き上げた男は、大先生に恭しくお辞儀すると、すぐ外へ出て行った。やがて、さっきの通り
「……さて、通行の方々」
とまた繰り返している声が聞こえてきた。
板壁の前の粗末な長椅子に目白押しに腰かけている五人へ大先生は、おほんともったいぶった咳をすると、軽く僕を招いた。あとは例の通り、分かったような分からないようなご神託よろしく、十分も経つと、
「普通鑑定はこれまで。料金は五百円いただく道理じゃな。ご希望とあらば特別鑑定もいたそう。ええと、料金は千円、二千円、五千円とあるが――」
三十円は案内料、鑑定料は五百円、こんちくしょうめ、まんまとペテンにかけやがった。
「ふむ、何をもじもじなさっとるかの。ははあ、失礼じゃが五百円のお持ち合わせはないらしいのう。三百円、いや二百円に特別に勉強（値引き）しときましょう」
さすがは大先生、こちらの懐具合もお見通しである。二百円を机の上に置いた僕は、もう秋だというのに、脇の下にびっしょり冷汗をかいて飛び出した。しかし、どうも不思議である。あの大先生にはどこかで会ったことがあるぞ……あっ、そうか。僕は、一番初め、易者の説明を一人で立って聞いていて、見物人が増えた時分にいつの間にか消え失せていたあのちゃぴん頭にあごひげの親父こそ、いま二百円巻き上げた大先生その人であることに気がついたのである！

**第三話　艶画奇譚（えんがきたん）**
戦災で丸焼けになった昔懐かしい松島遊廓。それがいつの間にか、元の古巣から三丁あまり西、茨住吉神社北門前一帯に、「特殊喫茶」という名前で復活していた。
だいたい焼ける前の松島というと、当時は、築港へ寄港する船の船員とか、木津川、安治川を上下する船のおじさんが、飛田や今里よりもちょっと柄が悪い。地回りのチンピラが多いし、ハッタリばかりに斬った張ったの喧嘩も始終のことであった。
それに例のY画（卑猥な絵）、Y写真売りの多いことも知る人ぞ知るで、僕みたいな温厚善良な？紳士は遊びに行くのをためらったものである。
しかし、気分一転、茨住吉の方へ移ったのだし、「特殊喫茶」と名も変わったのだから、前みたいにえげつないことはあるまい。まあ一度見物に……（にやにや笑いなさんな、本当に見物だけですがな）出かけた。
市電は本田二丁目で降りる。北は華やかな……。

（下部セリフ）
「あんた――あ――。しっかりしなはれ」
地底から呼ぶような途切れ途切れの叫びにふと目覚めると、白いベッドに横いかぶさるように、新やんとお雪が懸命に覗き込んでいた。
おわい（私）は、すると死ねなかったんやな。
グッとお熱いものが込み上げて、新やんが傍から、
「なあ、源やん。悪い夢や。長い――悪い夢を見てきたんや。凡人は凡人らしく、一生平凡に暮らすのが一番幸せやで。女房可愛がって、子供の二人三人にも取り囲まれて平和に暮らせたらそれが一番ええんや。なあ、源やん、力合わせて、もういっぺん出直そう」
「よう分かった」と手を振って、
「今度こそ、あんな危ない橋渡らんと、まともに暮らそう。金儲けばかりが世渡りやない。人間の愛情が一番肝心やったんや……。
ああ、えらい（とても）腹が減った。どこかでチャルメラの笛が聞こえてるわ。うん、中華そば食べたいな。もうろく（？）死ねんわいと思いながら、

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"...Because of..."
To me, who was pushed a number tag about the size of a playing card, following the four people in the front row, after quickly handing over the tags,
"Come on, step inside!"
[The man] led the five of us in. Inside the shack, the wooden walls were all over pasted with diagrams of physiognomy and palmistry instead of posters. In the front were a desk and chair; on the desk, divination sticks (zeitiku), counting blocks (sanki), a magnifying glass, and worm-eaten thick divination books were piled up. Sitting heavily in the chair was the one called "Great Master," stroking his long chin beard on his smooth, bald "chaping" head leisurely. The man who led the five of us in
"Then, as a guidance fee, 30 yen per person,"
thrust out his hand. The man who collected a total of 150 yen without allowing a word of protest bowed respectfully to the Great Master and immediately went outside. Before long, as before,
"...Now then, passersby,"
the voice repeating [the pitch] could be heard.
To the five of us sitting side-by-side on the crude long bench in front of the wooden wall, the Great Master gave a pretentious "ahem" cough and lightly beckoned me. After that, as usual, with a "you-understand-but-don't-understand" sort of oracle, after about ten minutes passed,
"Standard appraisal ends here. The fee is 500 yen, I suppose. If you wish, I shall also do a special appraisal. Let's see, the fees are 1,000 yen, 2,000 yen, 5,000 yen—"
Thirty yen was the guidance fee, the appraisal fee is 500 yen—damn him, he completely swindled me.
"Hmm, why are you hesitating? Haha, excuse me, but it seems you don't have 500 yen on hand. I'll 'study' (discount) it specifically to 300 yen, no, 200 yen."
As expected of the Great Master, he can see through the state of one's pocket. I, who placed 200 yen on the desk, though it was already autumn, jumped out with armpits dripping with cold sweat. However, it is very strange; I have seen that Great Master somewhere before... Ah, that's it! I realized that the bald, bearded old man who was standing alone listening to the fortune teller's explanation at the very beginning and disappeared unnoticed when the crowd grew was the Great Master himself who just took 200 yen!

**Chapter 3: Strange Tale of Erotic Pictures**
The nostalgic Matsushima Pleasure Quarter that was burnt to a crisp in the war. Before one knew it, it had been revived under the name "Special Tea Houses" in the area in front of the north gate of Ibarasumiyoshi Shrine, about three *cho* west of the original nest.
Speaking of Matsushima before it burned, at that time, the sailors of ships calling at the port or the middle-aged men on ships going up and down the Kizu and Aji Rivers were a bit rougher than those in Tobita or Imazato. There were many local punks, and fights involving bluffing and slashing/hitting were a constant occurrence.
Furthermore, the abundance of those "Y-pictures" and "Y-photos" (pornography) sellers was known to those who knew, and a gentle and honest? gentleman like me hesitated to go play there.
However, with a change of mood, since it moved to the Ibarasumiyoshi side and changed its name to "Special Tea Houses," surely there won't be anything as nasty as before. Well, just for a look... (Don't grin; it's really just for a look) I set out.
Getting off the streetcar at Honda 2-chome. To the north is the flashy...

(Bottom dialogue)
"You—ah—. Keep it together."
Suddenly waking up to a fragmented cry like a call from the bottom of the earth, Shinya and Oyuki were leaning over a white bed, looking in desperately.
I... then, I couldn't die.
Something hot welled up, and Shinya from the side,
"Hey, Gen-yan. It's a bad dream. You've come back from a long—bad dream. Ordinary people should live like ordinary people; living a mediocre life is the greatest happiness. Cherishing a wife, being surrounded by two or three children, and living in peace is the best. Hey, Gen-yan, let's join forces and start over one more time—"
"I understand well—" waving a hand,
"This time for sure, without crossing such dangerous bridges, let's live decently. Making money isn't the only way to get through life. Human affection was the most important thing...
Ah, I'm terribly hungry. I can hear the sound of a charumera (noodle vendor's flute) somewhere. Yeah, I want to eat Chinese noodles. Thinking 'I can't die yet,'
—Oyuki, I'm counting on you—"
Grasping her hand, Genkichi was again, this time, invited into a peaceful, deep—sleep—.
(The End)

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"...And that is why..."
After being shoved a numbered ticket about the size of a playing card, I followed the four people ahead of me into a shack.
"Step right in!" the shill shouted as he ushered us inside. The walls of the makeshift hut were papered with diagrams of palmistry and physiognomy instead of posters. At the center sat a desk and chair. Piled atop the desk were divination sticks, counting blocks, a magnifying glass, and thick, moth-eaten volumes on the occult. Perched grandly in the chair was a man they called the "Great Master." He had a smooth, glistening bald head and a long white beard, which he stroked with an air of immense leisure.
The man who had brought us in suddenly thrust out his hand. "Thirty yen each for the entrance fee," he demanded. Before anyone could protest, he had pocketed 150 yen. With a deep, respectful bow to the "Master," he vanished back outside. Moments later, his voice drifted in from the street once more: "...Now then, ladies and gentlemen!"

The five of us sat huddled on a crude bench against the wall. The Master let out a ponderous cough and beckoned me forward. What followed was the usual jargon—vague oracles that seemed to mean everything and nothing at once. After ten minutes, he paused.
"The standard appraisal ends here. That will be five hundred yen. However, if you wish, I can perform a special reading. Those run one thousand, two thousand, or even five thousand yen—"
Thirty yen for the door, five hundred for the reading... that bastard! I’d been completely swindled.
"Hmm, why the hesitation? Ah, I see. Forgive me, but it seems you don't have five hundred yen on you. Tell you what—I'll give you a discount. Three hundred? No, let's make it two hundred yen."
Truly, the "Great Master" could see right through my wallet. I slapped two hundred yen on the desk and bolted out. Despite it being autumn, I was drenched in a cold sweat. But a nagging thought bothered me. I’d seen that Master somewhere before... then it hit me! The bald, bearded old man who had been standing in the crowd listening to the pitch, only to disappear once the audience grew—that was the "Great Master" himself! He’d been his own shill!

**Episode 3: The Tale of the Erotic Pictures**
Old Matsushima—the pleasure quarter so many remember with nostalgia—was burnt to the ground during the war. But before anyone realized it, it had been reborn about three blocks west of its old haunt, near the north gate of Ibarasumiyoshi Shrine, under the guise of "Special Tea Houses."
In the old days, Matsushima was a rough place. The sailors coming into the port and the men working the ships on the Kizu and Aji Rivers were a tougher lot than the crowds at Tobita or Imazato. It was thick with local thugs, and fights were a daily occurrence. It was also notorious for the "Y-pictures"—under-the-counter pornography. A "respectable" gentleman like myself usually steered clear.
But then I thought, it’s moved now, and with the new name "Special Tea House," surely it’s become more refined. Maybe I’ll just go for a look... (Wipe that smirk off your face; I really did just go to look!)
I hopped off the streetcar at Honda 2-chome. To the north lay the glittering...

(Bottom Section)
"Sir—please—stay with us!"
I woke to a fragmented cry that seemed to echo from the depths of the earth. Leaning over my hospital bed were Shinya and Oyuki, their faces filled with desperate hope.
I... I hadn't died after all.
A wave of heat welled up in my chest. Shinya spoke from my bedside.
"Listen, Gen-yan. It was just a nightmare. A long, terrible dream. We’re ordinary folk, and a quiet, mediocre life is the best kind of happiness there is. Having a wife to love and a few kids to look after—that’s all a man needs. Come on, Gen-yan, let’s pull ourselves together and start over."
"I understand," I said, waving a weak hand. "This time, no more 'crossing dangerous bridges.' We'll live honestly. Life isn't just about chasing money; it's the love between people that matters most."
"God, I'm starving," I added. From somewhere outside, I could hear the mournful trill of a noodle vendor’s flute. "I could really go for some ramen." Even as I thought, *I guess I’m too stubborn to die just yet*, I reached out for Oyuki.
"Oyuki... I'm counting on you."
As he gripped her hand, Genkichi drifted off once more—this time into a deep, peaceful sleep.
(The End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** This is a classic magazine layout from the "Kasutori" (pulp) era. It uses vertical text (tategaki) arranged in three main columns.
*   **Illustration:** A central cartoonish illustration depicts the "Great Master" (fortune teller) and his shill in a shack. The art style is "Heta-uma" (intentionally crude/charming), common in mid-century periodicals.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   The top half contains the conclusion of one story (the fortune-telling swindle).
    *   A bold horizontal line separates this from the start of a new story: "Third Episode: Strange Tale of Erotic Pictures."
    *   The bottom section contains a dialogue-heavy emotional climax of a story, possibly the one starting in the middle or a different serialized piece.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of standard Mincho-style typeface with historical kana usage (*rekishiteki kanazukai*). The titles use larger, bolder fonts.
*   **Design Features:** Small decorative flourishes separate sections. The page number "(34)" is at the bottom center.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII / 1940s-50s):** The text mentions "戦災で丸焼けになった" (burnt to a crisp in war damage), referring to the 1945 firebombing of Osaka. This places the story in the reconstruction era.
*   **Matsushima Pleasure Quarter:** Matsushima was one of Osaka's major "yukaku" (authorized pleasure districts). After being destroyed in the war, it was rebuilt nearby.
*   **Tokushu Kissa (Special Tea Houses):** Following the war and the eventual Anti-Prostitution Act (1956), many brothels rebranded as "Special Tea Houses" to bypass regulations, though they continued to offer sexual services.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term "Kasutori" refers to cheap, low-quality magazines that flourished post-war, often focusing on gossip, erotica, and pulp fiction. The tone here—alternating between cynical urban observations and melodrama—is typical of this genre.
*   **Fortune Telling (Ekigaku):** In the chaotic post-war years, street fortune-tellers (using *zeitiku* sticks and palmistry) were common as people sought hope or guidance in a destroyed economy. The text highlights the predatory nature of these street stalls.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **断易 (Dan'eki):** A form of divination using coins or sticks, part of the I Ching tradition.
*   **ちゃぴん頭 (Chapin-atama):** An old slang term for a bald head.
*   **勉強 (Benkyō):** In a retail/service context, this means "to discount" or "give a deal."
*   **茨住吉神社 (Ibarasumiyoshi Shrine):** A real shrine in Nishi-ku, Osaka, providing a specific geographical anchor for the story.
*   **チン公 (Chin-ko):** Slang for "Chinpira" (low-level hoodlums or punks).
*   **ハッタリ (Hattari):** Bluffing or acting tough.
*   **Y画 / Y写真 (Y-ga / Y-shashin):** Euphemisms for "Erotica" or "Pornography" (Y standing for "Yuwaku" [temptation] or simply a code for taboo content).
*   **チャルメラ (Charumera):** A double-reed wind instrument played by itinerant ramen vendors to signal their arrival.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Hustle of the City:** The first story illustrates the cynical nature of urban life—everyone is running a scam. The "Great Master" and his shill work together to trap marks.
*   **Post-War Survival:** The characters are obsessed with money and "f懐具合" (the state of their wallets), reflecting the desperate economic conditions of the time.
*   **The "Ordinary Life" Ideal:** The bottom dialogue reflects a common post-war sentiment: after the trauma of war and the chaos of the black market, the ultimate goal is "heibon" (a mediocre/ordinary life) with a family.
*   **Nostalgia and Decay:** The narrator views the pleasure districts with a mix of nostalgia ("懐かしい") and wariness, highlighting the "garawaru" (rough character) of the Osaka docks.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
