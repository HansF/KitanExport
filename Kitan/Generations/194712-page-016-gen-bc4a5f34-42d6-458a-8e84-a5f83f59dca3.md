#### 私のサディスト趣味
（東京都・事務員・三七歳・女性）

私（わたくし）は、生れてこの方、男の軆（からだ）というものに、少しも興味を持たなかつた。と云ふよりは、寧ろ（むしろ）嫌惡（けんを）を抱いて居たのかも知れない。
然（しか）し、ある日、会社の上司であるＡ氏が、ふとしたことから私の秘めたる倒錯的な性癖に氣づいた。Ａ氏は私を、或る夜、無理に酒席に誘い、泥酔した私を抱きかかえて、彼の自宅へ連れ込んだのだ。
私は、目が覚めて、一切の抵抗をやめた。Ａ氏は、裸にされた私に、先づ、鞭（むち）をあてた。その痛みに、私は今迄（いままで）経験したことのない、鋭い歓喜（よろこび）を感じた。
「もっと、もっと」
と、私は絶叫した。それからといふものは、私はＡ氏の完全なる奴隷（どれい）となつた。毎夜、私は彼に、蝋燭（ろうそく）の炎（ほのお）で胸を焼かせ、手錠（てじやう）で縛られ、鞭打たれる。
これが私のサディスト趣味である。私を理解してくれるのは、唯（ただ）Ａ氏のみだ。

#### My Sadist Taste [Preference]
(Tokyo Metropolis / Office Worker / Thirty-Seven Years Old / Female)

I, since the day I was born, regarding the body of men, have held not the slightest interest. Rather than saying that, perhaps I held loathing instead.
However, one day, Mr. A, who is my superior at the company, from a chance occurrence, noticed my secret, perverse sexual habit. Mr. A, one night, forcibly invited me to a drinking establishment, and holding me, who was heavily intoxicated, brought me back to his own house.
When I awoke, I ceased all resistance. Mr. A, first, applied the whip to me, who had been stripped naked. In that pain, I felt a sharp ecstasy I had never experienced before.
“More, more,” I screamed.
Since then, I have become Mr. A’s complete slave. Every night, I have him burn my chest with the flame of a candle, bound by handcuffs, and whipped.
This is my sadist taste [preference]. The only one who understands me is Mr. A.

#### My Masochistic Awakening
(Tokyo / Office Clerk / 37 / Female)

For as long as I have lived, I have never held the slightest interest in the male physique. In fact, it might be more accurate to say I harbored a profound revulsion.
Yet, one day, my supervisor at the office, Mr. A, happened upon a clue regarding my hidden, perverted sexual tendencies. That night, Mr. A forced me to attend a drinking party, and once I was thoroughly drunk, he carried me away to his home.
When I woke up, I abandoned all resistance. Mr. A first applied a whip to my naked body. In that pain, I felt a sharp, intense joy, unlike anything I had ever known.
“More, more!” I shrieked.
Since that moment, I have become Mr. A’s absolute slave. Every night, I allow him to burn my chest with candle wax, to bind me in handcuffs, and to whip me mercilessly.
This is my ‘sadist’ preference. Mr. A is the only person who truly understands me.

### 5️⃣ Structural & Editorial Metadata

```markdown
## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Letter / Case Study / Personal Confession (often highly fictionalized or edited sensational reportage, common in *Kitan Club*). These are positioned as genuine experiences (*jitsuroku*).
*   **Author Attribution:** Pseudonymous (Tokyo, Office Worker, 37F). The use of the initial 'A' for the dominant male figure protects identity but maintains ambiguity and focus on the power dynamic.
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** The text is strictly the narrator's (confessor's) voice. The editorial structure is limited to the header, attribution, and pagination (**58**). The voice is intensely personal, clinical regarding the initial aversion, and highly dramatic regarding the subsequent discovery of S&M.
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Primarily voyeuristic male readership seeking sensational and forbidden sexual narratives involving female submission, particularly within modern settings (the office/workplace). The female perspective heightens the shock factor and implies an internal psychological justification for masochism.
*   **Positioning within the Magazine:** Likely a shorter piece, possibly filling a column toward the back or within a dedicated "Confessions of Perversion" section, preceding or following lengthier fictional works. The sequential numbering (58) suggests a short item number or a page number.

### 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

```markdown
## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Setting (Postwar Showa Era):** The description of a "事務員" (jimu-in / office worker) in Tokyo places the narrator within the burgeoning postwar white-collar workforce. This position suggests a façade of respectability, contrasting sharply with the confessed sexual deviance.
*   **Gender and Workplace Dynamics:** The dynamic relies on the deeply ingrained hierarchical structure of the mid-century Japanese company. The superior (A-shi) uses his authority to coerce the subordinate (the narrator). This scenario reflects the real power imbalance often exploited in that era, here framed as a sexual awakening.
*   **The Concept of "Sadist Taste" (サディスト趣味):** In the early S&M discourse popularized by magazines like *Kitan Club*, the terminology was often imprecise. The narrator calls her preference "sadist taste," but the actions described (being whipped, burned, and enslaved) are fundamentally masochistic. This blurring was common, possibly reflecting a general categorization of all non-normative sexuality involving pain as 'Sadism,' or possibly reflecting the editorial framing device.
*   **Literary Trope (Aversion to Lust):** The opening statement—"I held not the slightest interest in the male body"—is a classic literary device in ero-guro narratives, establishing the character as pure, cold, or frigid, only to be dramatically "cured" or awakened by pain and violation.
*   **Historical Kana Usage:** The use of 歴史的仮名遣い (e.g., なかつた, といふ, てじやう) firmly dates the text to the pre-1946 reform period or, more likely, the immediate postwar period (1940s-1950s) when pulp magazines deliberately used the older, formal script to convey a sense of gravitas or "serious literature."

### 8️⃣ Thematic & Subtext Analysis

```markdown
## Themes & Subtext

*   **Masochistic Awakening:** The primary theme is the sudden, violent discovery of sexual identity through pain. The narrative suggests that 'normal' sexuality was repulsive, while extreme pain provides the necessary catalyst for true female pleasure (歓喜/ecstasy).
*   **The Therapeutic Violator:** Mr. A is not merely a rapist or abuser; he is framed as the narrator's *savior* or *therapist*, the only person capable of unlocking her true, hidden self. This trope justifies the coercive and violent acts (coercion via alcohol, physical assault) by recasting them as necessary rituals of personalized devotion.
*   **Total Submission and Control:** The transformation into a "complete slave" (完全なる奴隷) fulfills a deep fantasy of relinquishing personal agency and moral responsibility, placing the woman entirely under the control of the male superior—a strong anti-modern, reactionary fantasy common in ero-guro narratives.
*   **Ero-Guro Tropes:** The text utilizes classic Ero-Guro elements: pain as pleasure, bodily violation (whipping, burning), bondage (handcuffs), and the contrast between the mundane (office job) and the extreme clandestine perversion.
*   **Anxiety of Female Desire:** The text implicitly addresses the societal anxiety surrounding independent female sexuality. By making her desire dependent on extreme male dominance and pain, the narrative contains and justifies her transgression within a patriarchal structure.
