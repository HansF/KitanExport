27　　　　文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き

（といろいろ身を揉み）
エエ、何の因果で此のように、憂き目にあふか。口惜しいわい。口惜しいわいなう。
江戸　道理だ道理だ。成る程、われは因果者。それに引きかへ此方は仕合せ。仇を討つべきわがまでも、縛りからげて腹を裂き、その生血が薬となる。仇のおのれを助ける良薬。みすみす愛で返り討。イヤ、返り討も多く見たが、皮千枚で此ざまは、ハテ珍らしい。
アレイ、アレイ。
エエ、死にともない死にともない。誰もいぬかいなう。
アレイ、アレイ。
江戸　高吠えするな。その跪くのがこの世の別れ。今が皮切り、辛抱しろ。
（と「アレイアレイ」と説くお松の胸元を出刃を以て突き込む。これにて苦しみ身悶えするを、江戸兵衛よろしくこなし。この時、腹の中から赤子出でて泣く。江戸兵衛、恂りとして）
なんだ。赤子か。エエ、不便な餓鬼だ。
（と引出して門口へ捨てる。この時、薄ドロドロにて、お松、眼を見開き、江戸兵衛をキッと見る。）
なんだ。まだ死なねえのか。エエ、執念ぶかい。
（と死骸の板を蹴飛ばし、隅より素焼の壺を出し、捨てりふにて、生胆を出し、壺の中に入れ、片口を出し、懐の薬を半分引明けて、血を浸し、一つにして）
こいつは余っぽど飲み憎かろう。
（と顔をしかめながら、グッと飲む。）
腹を割いて胎児を取り出し、生血をのむという、まことに南北らしい場面である。ただ惜しいことに、お松は薬で顔をかえられた醜女なので、同情が半減する。
最後に現代物から、香山滋氏の「鮫鱗」の一節
『ああ、可哀そうなお母さん！お母さんはこぼれるやうなお腹を抱えて、伊勢源の厄介になったの。お店の女中をしてて知った男に孕まされて、捨てられて。捨てられて。
それは冬の、雲の降る冷たい夜だった。宴会がたてこんで、あの人は転手古舞いだった。朝から晩まで、鮫鱗の林の中で剣の舞をやってたの。その部屋の直ぐ裏が風呂場になって、お母さんはひとりで冷えきったからだを暖めていたの。――人間の運命なんて。ほんの一寸先も見えないもんね。
酔いどれ客のひとりが、厠へ立った帰りに、ふっといたづら心で風呂場を覗いて、お母さんひとり、しかも懐妊している女と見てとって、いきなり飛び込んで変なことをしようとしたの。お母さんは吃驚して、でも気丈に声も音も立てず、勝手知った隣の調理場へ逃げ込んで、鮫鱗の林の間に忍んだの。痴漢は執念深くつけて来る気配だったし、お客に恥をかかしては世話になっているお内儀に済まないとも考えて、お母さんは息を殺して吊された鮫鯨と鮫鯨の間にはさまれてじっと眼をつぶったの。それが不可（いけ）なかった。臨時の宴会用で気が急いでいたし、電灯もひとつしか点けず、第一、連日の疲れで頭もぼっとしてたあの人は、大きな奴一匹で事済まそそうと、隙も見せず、いきなり真っ白い膨らみのある腹に出刃を突刺して一気に割き下ろした！うひいっという悲鳴につづいて、どさっと床のタタキにその鮫鯨が仰向けにのけぞって、その割けた腹から血が泡立ち、ああその中に奇蹟の児がうごめいていた！
あんた、変って此んなすさまじい生れ方をした児なのよ。』

27 Women’s belly-slitting appearing in literature

(And so writhing body in various ways)
"Eh, by what karma in this way, do I meet such a bitter fate? Regrettable. It is regrettable."
Edo: "Reasonable, reasonable. Indeed, you are a person of karma. In contrast, this side is fortunate. Even for me who should take revenge, I tie [you] up and slit the belly, and that fresh blood becomes medicine. A good medicine to help me, the enemy. Looking on at the love, a counter-slaying. No, I have seen many counter-slayings, but with a thousand layers of skin this state is, well, rare."
"Arei, arei."
"Eh, I don't want to die, I don't want to die. Is no one there?"
"Arei, arei."
Edo: "Do not bark loudly. That kneeling is the parting from this world. Now is the start, endure it."
(And with "Arei Arei" crying O-matsu's chest-area using a deba-knife he thrusts in. With this, suffering and writhing, Edo Hyōe handles it well. At this time, from inside the belly a baby comes out and cries. Edo Hyōe, being startled)
"What. A baby? Eh, a pitiable brat."
(And pulls out and to the gate-mouth throws away. At this time, with thin mud-sound/drums, O-matsu, opens eyes wide, and at Edo Hyōe sharply looks.)
"What. Not yet dead? Eh, deep-seated grudge/persistence."
(And the corpse's board kicks away, from the corner an unglazed jar takes out, with a parting remark, takes out the fresh liver, puts into the jar, takes out a spout-bowl, takes out medicine from the pocket and opens half, soaks the blood, makes into one)
"This guy is likely very hard to drink."
(And while grimacing, gulps and drinks.)
Splitting the belly and taking out the fetus, drinking the fresh blood, is a truly Nanboku-like scene. Only, regrettably, because O-matsu is an ugly woman whose face was changed by medicine, sympathy is halved.
Lastly from modern works, a passage from Mr. Shigeru Kayama's "Same-uroko" (Shark Scales):
"Ah, poor Mother! Mother, holding a spilling-over belly, became a burden to Ise-gen. Pregnant by a man she knew while working as a maid at the shop, abandoned. Abandoned.
It was a winter, snow-falling cold night. Banquets were crowded, that person was spinning around [busy]. From morning to night, inside a forest of shark-skins he was doing a sword dance. Immediately behind that room was the bath, Mother alone was warming her chilled-through body. —Human fate. Even one inch ahead cannot be seen.
One of the drunken guests, on the way back from the toilet, suddenly with a prankster heart peeked into the bath, seeing Mother alone, moreover a pregnant woman, suddenly jumped in and tried to do something strange. Mother was startled, but bravely without making a voice or sound, fled into the familiar neighboring kitchen, and hid between the forest of hanging sharks. The molester seemed to be following tenaciously, and thinking it wouldn't do to shame the guest and wrong the landlady who looks after her, Mother held her breath and squeezed between the hanging sharks and shut her eyes tight. That was bad. Because it was for a temporary banquet his spirit was hurried, and only one electric light was lit, and first of all, with consecutive days' fatigue his head was fuzzy, that person, thinking to finish the job with one big fellow, without showing a gap, suddenly into the white bulging belly thrust the deba-knife and in one breath slit down! Following a 'Uhii' scream, with a thud onto the floor-stone that shark fell back, from that slit belly blood bubbled, ah, inside that a miracle child was squirming!
You, you are a child who had such a terrible way of being born."
(End)

**27: Depictions of Women’s Disembowelment in Literature**

*(The victim writhes in agony)*
"Oh, what cruel karma has brought me to this wretched end? How bitter this is! How truly bitter!"
**Edo:** "It is only right. Indeed, you are a victim of fate. I, on the other hand, am blessed. Though I am your sworn enemy, I shall bind you, slit your belly, and take your fresh blood as my medicine. A fine remedy to aid your foe. I’ve seen many 'counter-slayings' in my time, but one where the skin is stripped away like this is rare indeed."
"Help! Help me!"
"Oh, I do not want to die! Is there no one there?"
"Help!"
**Edo:** "Stop your howling. This kneeling posture is your final farewell to this world. This is just the beginning; endure it."
*(He thrusts a heavy carving knife into the chest of the crying O-matsu. As she writhes in agony, Edo Hyōe methodically carries out the deed. Suddenly, a baby emerges from her womb and begins to wail. Edo Hyōe is momentarily taken aback.)*
"What’s this? A brat? Hmph, a pitiful little creature."
*(He drags the infant out and tosses it toward the doorway. To the sound of ominous drums, O-matsu flings her eyes open and glares intensely at Edo Hyōe.)*
"What? Not dead yet? You certainly are a persistent one."
*(He kicks aside the board the corpse lay upon and pulls an unglazed jar from the corner. With a callous parting word, he removes her fresh liver and places it in the jar. He pours half a packet of medicine into a bowl, mixes it with her blood, and blends the concoction.)*
"This looks like it’ll be a damn hard thing to swallow."
*(He grimaces as he gulps the mixture down.)*

This scene—splitting the belly to remove a fetus and drinking fresh blood—is quintessential Nanboku [Tsuruya Nanboku IV]. It is only a shame that O-matsu is an 'ugly woman' whose features were disfigured by poison, as it halves the reader's sympathy for her.

Finally, a passage from a modern work: "Shark Scales" by Shigeru Kayama.
"Oh, my poor mother! Heavy with child, she sought refuge at the Ise-gen inn. She had been knocked up and abandoned by a man she met while working as a maid. Abandoned and alone.
It was a cold, snowy winter night. The inn was packed with banquets, and the chef was run off his feet. From dawn to dusk, he was performing a 'sword dance' amidst a forest of hanging shark skins. Right behind that room was the bathhouse, where Mother was warming her freezing body alone. Human fate is a fickle thing; we cannot see even an inch into the future.
A drunken guest, returning from the latrine, peered into the bath on a whim. Seeing Mother there alone—and pregnant—he burst in to have his way with her. Terrified but brave, she didn't make a sound. She fled into the kitchen she knew so well and hid among the hanging sharks. The harasser was close behind. Fearing she would cause a scene and shame the mistress of the house who had been so kind to her, she held her breath and squeezed between two large sharks, closing her eyes tight. That was her fatal mistake. Rushed by the banquet and exhausted from days of work, the chef—working under a single dim light—spotted what he thought was a large shark. Without a second thought, he thrust his knife into the pale, bulging belly and slit it open in one stroke! Following a piercing scream, the 'shark' collapsed onto the stone floor. From the opened womb, blood bubbled forth, and there, miraculously, a child was squirming!
My dear, you are that child—born into this world in such a horrific, unimaginable way."
(End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows a standard vertical Japanese layout (top-to-bottom, right-to-left).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is centered at the top within a simple decorative border. The page number "27" is in the upper left corner.
*   **Typography:** The font is a classic post-war Mincho, which feels somewhat archaic today due to certain kanji forms (e.g., 孕 for pregnancy, 呻 for moaning).
*   **Structure:** The text is divided into three distinct parts:
    1.  A commentary/introductory section referencing a classic play.
    2.  A script-like excerpt with character names (江戸/Edo) and stage directions in parentheses.
    3.  A modern prose excerpt introduced by the editor.
*   **Illustrative Elements:** A small decorative border is used at the top of the page.
*   **Genre:** This appears to be from a "Zankoku" (Cruelty) or "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" magazine, which were popular in the 1950s. These publications focused on the grotesque, the bizarre, and the erotic.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Tsuruya Nanboku IV (南北):** The text mentions "Nanboku-like." This refers to the famous Kabuki playwright Tsuruya Nanboku IV (1755–1829), known for his "Kizewamono" plays which depicted the gritty, violent, and supernatural underbelly of Edo-period society.
*   **Kimo-tori (Liver-taking):** The scene of cutting a person open to take their liver or blood for medicine is a recurring motif in Japanese folklore and Kabuki (e.g., the *Adachigahara* hag). It was believed that the liver or blood of a pregnant woman had miraculous healing properties.
*   **Shigeru Kayama (香山滋):** A prominent Japanese author (1904–1975) known for science fiction and mystery. He is most famous for writing the original story for the first *Godzilla* (1954) film. "Same-uroko" (Shark Scales, 1948) is one of his "primitive" or "grotesque" stories.
*   **The Post-War Pulp Era:** In the late 1940s and 50s, Japan saw a surge in "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, lurid publications. This text fits that aesthetic: blending high literature (Kabuki) with modern horror to satisfy a public appetite for the "zankoku" (cruel).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **因果 (Inga):** Karma/Fate. Frequently used in melodrama to explain tragic circumstances as the result of past sins.
*   **憂き目 (Ukime):** A bitter experience or a hard lot in life.
*   **生血 (Seiketsu/Ikichi):** Fresh blood.
*   **返り討 (Kaeri-uchi):** When someone seeking revenge is killed by their intended target instead.
*   **出刃 (Deba):** A heavy Japanese carving knife, usually used for butchering fish, but here used for a human.
*   **餓鬼 (Gaki):** Literally "hungry ghost," but used here as a derogatory or pitying term for a child/brat.
*   **ドロドロ (Doro-doro):** Onomatopoeia. In Kabuki, this refers to the specific drum pattern used to signal the appearance of a ghost or a gruesome scene.
*   **鮫鯨 (Same-kujira):** Likely refers to large sharks or whale sharks.
*   **てんてこ舞い (Tenteko-mai):** Being incredibly busy or frantic.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Horrific Motherhood:** The text explores pregnancy not as a state of joy but as a site of extreme vulnerability and physical horror. The "miracle" of birth is subverted into a "miracle" of surviving a slaughter.
*   **Class and Abandonment:** Both stories involve women in precarious social positions (a disfigured woman, an abandoned maid) who are victimized because they lack protection.
*   **Dehumanization:** In the second story, the mother is literally mistaken for a "fish" (a shark) and butchered. This metaphorical dehumanization highlights the low status of the woman in that social setting.
*   **Fatalism:** The text emphasizes "Inga" (Karma) and the "Unmei" (Fate) that cannot be seen "even an inch ahead." This fatalistic worldview was common in post-war Japan as people tried to make sense of the senseless violence of the war years.
