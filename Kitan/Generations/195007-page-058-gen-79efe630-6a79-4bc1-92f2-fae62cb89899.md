かくして薬がすっかり出来上ると、それを壜につめて、病床で首を長くして待つていゐる刈田の許へ馳けつけたのである。

五、
刈田の喜び方は一通りではなかつた。私は、彼に頼まれて嫌な思いをした甲斐があったとつくづく思つた。

私は、早速、壜に入つたその赤い薬を、茶碗に移しかへて、刈田の口許までもつて行つてやつた。刈田は、それを一気にぐつと飲み干した。
私は、その薬の効目如何にと、じつと息を殺して彼の顔を見つめた。しばらくすると、彼の額から、鼻の頭から、汗が流れ始めたではないか――すごい効目だ！ 私は、思わず目を見はつた。熱病は汗を出せば熱がとれて治ると云う事を今まで経験して知つていたからだ。すると、今度は彼はむくむくとからだを起して、きょろきょろとまわりを見廻わし始めたのである。その眼の凄いこと、フダンの刈田と違つた何か別人のような感じを私させたのだ。――こりゃ一体どうしたことか私は、眼をこすつた。その中に、彼の視線が私のとカチリとぶつかつた。すると、彼はにたりと笑つたのだ。何と云ういやらしい気味の悪い笑い。それが、にぶい電燈の光をあびて、一段と凄みと不気味さを増していたのだ。
私は思わず後ずさりした。「ヒヒヒヒヒ……」 彼は、歯をむき出したかと思うと、次の瞬間、物凄い勢で私につかみかかつて来た。身をかわしたのがおそかつた。彼は、私のからだにむしゃぶりつくと、からだをくねらし始めたのである。まさに色気狂いである。「ヒヤアッ助けて！」 私は、悲鳴を上げて、必死になつて彼のからだをふりほどいた。すると彼は、がばつとはね起き、障子を蹴倒すようにして部屋の外へ出ると、荒々しく階段を下りて行つたのである。

私は、何が何だかさつぱり分からず、まるで狐にでもつままれたように畳の上にへたばつていたが、はつと思いたることがあつた。それは、あの老婆が、もし処女のでなつたなら大変な事になりますぞと、刈田に言つた言葉を思い出したからである。――まさか、あの須磨子嬢に限つて、処女でないなんて。と、一度は否定したが、この薬のすごい効き方を目のあたりに見せつけられた今、どうしても須磨子嬢が処女でないと思うより外に仕方がなかつた。

その時であつた。「キャーッ！」 表の方から、絹を裂くような女の悲鳴が聞えて来た。――さては刈田の奴が、 私は、すぐさま階段をかけ下りて、家の外へ出た。するとこれは又どうしたことだろう家の前の道路で、刈田が一人の婦人をとらまえ、無理失理につかみかかつているのだ。私は飛鳥のように二人の間に飛び込んでひきはなした。

六、
刈田は、完全に発狂したのである。それも、色情性発狂とか云う、厄介な病名を頂戴したのである。 彼は、直ちに脳病院に送られた。私が今から思うに、あの時使用したあの高貴薬とか称する粉末の中に、人間の脳細胞を破壊し、性慾を昂進させるような成分がまじつていたのではないかと思うのである。 だから、利根須磨子嬢は、私が始めに思つた通り立派に処女であつたに違いない。 いずれにせよ、私が、あの時刈田の反対を押し切つて医者を呼んでいたらこんなことには、ならなかつたであらうから、私はその責任を大いに感じているのである。 幸いにも、刈田はその後着々と快方に向いつつあると云う事だ。（完）

かくして薬がすっかり出来上がると、それを瓶に詰めて、病床で首を長くして待っている刈田の元へ駆けつけたのである。

五、
刈田の喜び方は一通りではなかった。私は、彼に頼まれて嫌な思いをした甲斐があったとつくづく思った。

私は、早速、瓶に入ったその赤い薬を、茶碗に移し替えて、刈田の口元まで持って行ってやった。刈田は、それを一気にぐっと飲み干した。
私は、その薬の効き目いかにと、じっと息を殺して彼の顔を見つめた。しばらくすると、彼の額から、鼻の頭から、汗が流れ始めたではないか――すごい効き目だ！ 私は、思わず目を見張った。熱病は汗を出せば熱が引いて治るということを今まで経験して知っていたからだ。すると、今度は彼はむくむくと体を起こして、きょろきょろと周りを見回し始めたのである。その眼の凄まじいこと、普段の刈田と違った何か別人のような感じを私にさせたのだ。――こりゃ一体どうしたことか、私は目をこすった。その最中に、彼の視線が私のとカチリとぶつかった。すると、彼はニタリと笑ったのだ。何といういやらしい気味の悪い笑い。それが、鈍い電灯の光を浴びて、一段と凄みと不気味さを増していたのだ。
私は思わず後ずさりした。「ヒヒヒヒヒ……」 彼は、歯を剥き出したかと思うと、次の瞬間、ものすごい勢いで私に掴みかかってきた。身をかわすのが遅かった。彼は、私の体にむしゃぶりつくと、体をくねらせ始めたのである。まさに色情狂である。「ヒヤアッ助けて！」 私は悲鳴を上げて、必死になって彼の体を振りほどいた。すると彼は、がばっと跳ね起き、障子を蹴倒すようにして部屋の外へ出ると、荒々しく階段を下りて行ったのである。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Thus, when the medicine was completely finished, [I] bottled it and to Karida's place, who was waiting in sickbed with neck lengthened (impatiently), [I] rushed.

5.
Karida's way of being happy was not ordinary. I deeply thought there was worth in the unpleasant feeling I had being asked by him.

I immediately transferred that red medicine in the bottle to a tea bowl and took it to Karida's mouth. Karida drank it up in one gulp. I, wondering about the medicine's effect, held my breath and stared at his face. After a while, from his forehead, from the tip of his nose, didn't sweat start to flow?—Amazing effect! I instinctively opened my eyes wide. Because I knew from experience that in a fever, if you sweat, the heat leaves and you recover. Then, this time, he sluggishly raised his body and began to look around restlessly. The fearsomeness of those eyes, they made me feel he was someone else, different from the usual Karida. —What on earth is this, I rubbed my eyes. In the midst of that, his gaze clicked and bumped into mine. Then, he grinned "nitari." What a disgusting, creepy laugh. That, bathing in the dull light of the electric lamp, increased its dread and eeriness further.
I instinctively backed away. "Hi-hi-hi-hi-hi..." The moment I thought he bared his teeth, the next instant, with terrifying force he lunged at me. Dodging was slow. He, clinging onto my body, began to writhe his body. Truly, it was sexual madness. "Hyaa! Help!" I screamed and desperately shook off his body. Then he sprang up, as if kicking down the shoji (paper door), left the room, and went down the stairs roughly.

I, not knowing what was what at all, was slumped on the tatami as if bewitched by a fox, but I suddenly hit upon something. It was because I remembered the words the old woman said to Karida, "If [the donor] was not a virgin, it will be a terrible thing." —No way, that Miss Sumako of all people, not being a virgin. I denied it once, but now having been shown the amazing effect of this medicine before my eyes, I had no choice but to think Miss Sumako was not a virgin.

It was at that time. "Kyaaa!" From the front, a woman's scream like tearing silk came hearing. —So, that fellow Karida... I immediately ran down the stairs and went outside the house. Then, what could this be, on the road in front of the house, Karida had caught a woman and was forcefully lunging at her. I flew like a bird between the two and pulled them apart.

6.
Karida went completely insane. Moreover, he received the troublesome diagnosis called "erotic madness." He was immediately sent to a brain hospital. What I think now is that in the powder called "noble medicine" used then, there might have been ingredients mixed in that destroy human brain cells and heighten libido. Therefore, Miss Sumako Tone must have been a fine virgin just as I thought at first. In any case, if I had pushed through Karida's opposition and called a doctor then, this kind of thing would not have happened, so I feel great responsibility. Fortunately, Karida is steadily moving toward recovery after that. (End)

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Once the medicine was ready, I bottled it and rushed to Karida's bedside, where he had been waiting impatiently. His joy was immense. Seeing it, I felt that the unpleasantness I’d endured at his request had been worth it after all.

I immediately poured the red liquid into a bowl and brought it to his lips. Karida drained it in a single gulp. Holding my breath, I watched his face intently, waiting for the effects. Before long, sweat began to bead on his forehead and the tip of his nose. It was working! I marveled at the speed of it; I knew from experience that once a feverish patient sweats, the illness breaks. But then, he slowly pulled himself up and began scanning the room with a restless, piercing gaze. There was something terrifying in his eyes—he looked like a different person entirely. Confused, I rubbed my eyes. Just then, our gazes locked. He broke into a sickening, twisted grin. Under the dim glow of the electric lamp, he looked more ghastly and unsettling than ever.

I instinctively recoiled. "He-he-he-he-he..." He bared his teeth and, in the next heartbeat, lunged at me with feral intensity. I was too slow to dodge. He threw himself upon me, his body writhing in a state of pure, lecherous mania. "Help! Aah!" I shrieked, desperately fighting to throw him off. He suddenly sprang up, kicked through the shoji screen, and stormed out of the room, clattering violently down the stairs.

I collapsed onto the tatami, dazed and bewildered as if I’d been bewitched. Then, a memory flashed through my mind: the old woman’s warning to Karida. "If she isn't a virgin," she had said, "there will be hell to pay." I tried to dismiss the thought—could a girl like Sumako really not be a virgin? But after witnessing the drug's horrific potency, I couldn't help but conclude that she must have been "tainted."

Suddenly, a blood-curdling scream—like the sound of tearing silk—shattered the silence from outside. Karida! I bolted down the stairs and out the door. There, in the middle of the street, Karida had cornered a woman and was assaulting her with brute force. I threw myself between them like a bird in flight and managed to pull him away.

Karida had lost his mind completely. He was diagnosed with a troublesome condition known as "erotomania" and was committed to a mental asylum. Looking back, I suspect that "exotic powder" contained some compound that destroys brain cells while pathologically heightening sexual desire. If that’s the case, then Miss Sumako Tone likely was the pure virgin I first took her for after all. Regardless, I feel a heavy burden of guilt; had I ignored Karida's protests and called a proper doctor sooner, this tragedy might have been avoided. Fortunately, I hear Karida is now making a steady recovery. (The End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a traditional two-column vertical format (tate-gaki), common in Japanese magazines and novels.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard Mincho typeface. The chapter headings ("五" and "六") are slightly larger.
*   **Visual Elements:** A line-art illustration occupies the top left corner, depicting a woman in a kimono with a somewhat melancholic expression, likely representing "Sumako," the woman mentioned in the text.
*   **Formatting:** The text uses double hyphens (――) for dramatic pauses or emphasis. Punctuation follows standard pre-modern conventions, with some archaic kana usage (e.g., `待つていゐる` for `待っている`).
*   **Page Marker:** The number "-59-" at the bottom indicates this is part of a larger serialized work or a collection of short stories.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** This text likely dates from the late 1940s to the 1950s. This period saw a boom in "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, pulpy publications that specialized in "Ero-Guro-Nonsense" (eroticism, grotesquerie, and the absurd).
*   **Medical Terminology:** The term `脳病院` (Nō-byōin, literally "Brain Hospital") was the common term for a psychiatric hospital before it was replaced by `精神病院` (Seishin-byōin). `色情性発狂` (Shikijō-sei hakkyō) refers to erotomania or hypersexuality viewed as a clinical insanity.
*   **The "Virginity" Trope:** The plot hinges on a classic folklore/pulp trope where the efficacy of a magical or scientific potion is dependent on the "purity" (virginity) of the person it is derived from or intended for. This reflects the conservative gender preoccupations of the era's popular literature.
*   **Kitsune ni Tsumamareta:** A common idiom (to be bewitched by a fox) used to describe a state of total bewilderment or being deceived by something seemingly supernatural.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **首を長くして待つ (Kubi o nagaku shite matsu):** Idiom meaning to wait with great anticipation (literally "waiting with a long neck").
*   **甲斐 (Kai):** Worth, benefit, or result of an action.
*   **むくむくと (Mukumuku to):** Onomatopoeia for something rising or swelling up suddenly.
*   **色気狂い (Irokigurui):** A derogatory or sensationalist term for someone obsessed with sex or suffering from erotomania.
*   **無理失理 (Muriyari):** A phonetic kanji spelling (ateji) for *muriyari*, meaning "by force" or "against one's will."
*   **昂進 (Kōshin):** A medical term for the elevation or acceleration of a biological process (e.g., heart rate or, in this case, libido).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Science vs. Superstition:** The story blends "red medicine" and "noble powders" (pseudo-science) with the warnings of an "old woman" (folklore).
*   **Loss of Control:** A central theme is the sudden, violent loss of masculine self-control, depicted as a descent into "grotesque" animalistic behavior.
*   **Moral Responsibility:** The narrator experiences "post-event guilt," a common trope in detective and mystery pulp where the observer fails to prevent a tragedy.
*   **Erotic-Grotesque (Ero-Guro):** The description of the "sickening laugh," "biting/clinging," and the woman's "scream like tearing silk" are hallmarks of the *Ero-Guro* aesthetic intended to titillate and shock the reader.
