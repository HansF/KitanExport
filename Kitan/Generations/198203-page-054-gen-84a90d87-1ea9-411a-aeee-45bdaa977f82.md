## 1️⃣ Original Japanese (Verbatim Transcription)

The text is transcribed vertically, right-to-left. Characters cut off or inferred from context are noted, but the primary transcription reflects the visible ink.

いするほうで、まして、女優を志す女なんてのは好きになれないのだ。
それにもかかわらず清美に興味を持ったのは、OLや人妻と違ってある種の気楽さがあったせいだろう。はっきりいって、女優などというのは、所詮、まともな女ではないのであり、いわば、SM愛好者と同じくこの社会の異端者、はぐれ者である。案の定、清美は私がサラリーマンでないと知ると、急速に親しみを増したようだった。
私と清美がラブホテルの門をくぐったのは、それから一週間とたっていなかった。
清美は処女ではなかった。過去に二人の男と関係があったということだが、そんなことは私は意に介しなかった。
私が清美に対してSMプレイへの飼育にとりかかったのは、五、六回も肉体関係を結んだ頃からであろうか。それまでの清美の様子から、最初の印象と違い、かなりマゾ性があると判断したからだった。
最初は、前述したように、結合したまま両手を後手に捻じあげる方法である。体位としては、背向位か後側位であろう。両手が自由にならないので、清美はしきりにもがいたが、この方法でしか私が終らないのを覚えこますと、おとなしく身を任すようになった。そればかりか、両手を後手に捻じあげられた時は私の終わりが近いことを知って自分のクライマックスも合わせるようになってきた。

## 3️⃣ Literal English Translation

...[tend to dislike], much less, I cannot bring myself to like a woman who aspires to be an actress.
Despite that, the reason I held an interest in Kiyomi was probably because, unlike an OL [Office Lady] or a human wife [married woman], there was a certain kind of ease. Speaking clearly, things like actresses are, after all, not decent women; so to speak, just like SM lovers, they are the heretics of this society, the strays/outcasts. Sure enough, when Kiyomi learned that I was not a salaryman, she seemed to rapidly increase her familiarity [with me].
It was not even one week later that I and Kiyomi passed through the gate of a love hotel.
Kiyomi was not a virgin. It was said that she had relations with two men in the past, but I did not mind such things.
It was probably from around the time we formed a physical relationship five or six times that I set about the rearing of Kiyomi toward SM play. From Kiyomi's condition until then, unlike my first impression, it was because I judged that she had considerable masochistic nature.
At first, as mentioned before, it is the method of twisting both hands behind the back while remaining joined [in intercourse]. As for the body position, it would be the rear-facing position or the rear-side position. Because both hands do not become free, Kiyomi struggled frequently, but when I made her memorize/learn that I would not finish except by this method, she came to obediently entrust her body [to me]. Not only that, when both hands were twisted up behind her back, knowing that my end was near, she came to match her own climax as well.

## 4️⃣ Literary English Translation

...I tend to avoid them; much less can I bring myself to like a woman who aspires to be an actress.
Despite this, my interest in Kiyomi likely stemmed from a certain ease she possessed, unlike an Office Lady or a housewife. To put it bluntly, actresses are not, in the end, "decent" women. They are, so to speak, the heretics of this society—the outcasts—much like those of us who love SM. Sure enough, once Kiyomi learned I wasn't a salaryman, she seemed to warm up to me immediately.
It wasn't even a week later that Kiyomi and I walked through the gates of a love hotel.
Kiyomi was not a virgin. She claimed to have been with two men in the past, but I paid that no mind.
It must have been after we had slept together five or six times that I began her "rearing"—training her for SM play. Based on her behavior up to that point, and contrary to my initial impression, I had determined that she possessed a significant masochistic streak.
In the beginning, as I mentioned earlier, I used a technique where I twisted her arms up behind her back while we were still joined. The position was likely rear-entry or spooning from behind. Because her hands were restricted, Kiyomi struggled incessantly at first. However, once I ingrained in her that this was the only way I could reach completion, she began to submit obediently. Furthermore, she eventually learned that having her arms twisted behind her signaled that I was close to finishing, and she began to time her own climax to match mine.

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** **Erotic Confessional Fiction (Jitsuwa / 実話)** or **Instructional Narrative**. The text blends a narrative story with a didactic, explanatory tone ("As mentioned before," "The method is..."), typical of SM magazines that served both as erotica and "manuals" for practitioners.
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person male narrator. The tone is detached, analytical, and dominant. He views the woman (Kiyomi) as a subject to be analyzed ("judged she had a masochistic nature") and trained ("rearing").
*   **Visual Relation:** The photograph depicts a woman in a rope bondage position (shibari) consistent with the text (hands likely bound behind, lying on a bed), though the text focuses on the *process* of reaching that state physically and psychologically.
*   **Target Audience:** Adult men, specifically enthusiasts of "Abnormal Sexual Love" (*Hentai Seiyoku* - a common neutral/positive term in this era's subculture), readers of magazines like *Kitan Club*, *SM Select*, or *Uramado*.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

*   **"Love Hotel" (ラブホテル):** The text explicitly uses the katakana "Love Hotel." This term began replacing "Tsurekomi-yado" (bring-along inns) in the late 1960s and became standard in the 1970s. This helps date the text to likely the **1970s or early 80s**.
*   **"OL" (Office Lady) & "Hitozuma" (Human Wife):** Standard archetypes in Japanese pornography and erotica. The narrator contrasts the "actress" (a loose, artistic outsider) with these "respectable" roles.
*   **"Salaryman" (サラリーマン):** The narrator defines himself by *not* being a salaryman, aligning himself with the "outcast" nature of the actress. This reflects the counter-cultural undercurrent of postwar SM literature, which often positioned perversion as a rebellion against the rigid, standardized life of the Japanese economic miracle.
*   **"Rearing" (Shiiku / 飼育):** A crucial term in Japanese SM literature. It implies the domestication of an animal. It gained literary weight from Oe Kenzaburo's *The Catch* (Shiiku), but in this context, it refers to the erotic training of a submissive partner.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes

*   **Shiiku (飼育):** *Rearing/Breeding.* Used for animals. When applied to humans in SM, it denotes a complete stripping of agency and the molding of the partner into a pet or slave.
*   **Ketsugou (結合):** *Union/Combination.* A clinical, almost mechanical euphemism for sexual penetration.
*   **Mazo-sei (マゾ性):** *Masochistic nature.* Derived from Sacher-Masoch. The text treats this as a latent psychological trait to be "diagnosed" and exploited.
*   **Hagure-mono (はぐれ者):** *Stray person/Outcast.* Someone who has strayed from the herd (mainstream society).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Social Alienation as Bonding:** The narrator explicitly connects his sexual deviance (SM) with the woman's profession (actress) as forms of social heresy. Their bond is predicated on being outside "normal" society (unlike OLs or Salarymen).
*   **The Clinical Gaze:** The sex is described not emotionally, but procedurally ("The method is...", "judged that...", "body position"). This pseudo-scientific detachment is a hallmark of *Kitan Club* style writing, which often presented perversion as a field of study.
*   **Conditioning (Pavlovian Response):** The narrator describes a conditioning process: Constraint $\rightarrow$ Narrator's Pleasure $\rightarrow$ Woman's Submission $\rightarrow$ Mutual Pleasure. He frames her pleasure as a learned response to his control.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** Explicit (Textual).
*   **Themes:** BDSM, Bondage, Submission, Training/Conditioning.
*   **Tone:** Clinical, Dominant, Misogynistic (objectification).
*   **Consent:** Dubious/Negotiated (Framed as "training" a resisting but ultimately willing partner).
