片矢 薫 ・ 七七夕 玲子え

**女学生の私刑！**
**肉体を弄ぶ女学生たち**

後ろに小高い山を控え、一年中まとも（ろ）に太陽を浴びることのない校舎、排水設備のない爲に僅か一日の雨で、二三日は水溜りの残る狭い運動場。これが青城女学院の姿である。
経営の困難から修繕も出来ない校舎は、硝子は破れ、羽目板は千切れ女の学校とは見えない荒廃ぶりであった。
河島あきはその女学院の四年生である。

あきは十八だが、高い上背（うわぜい）と胸のふくらみなどは、女学生とは見えなかった。殊に風呂から帰りの襟（えり）を落した着物姿では、その艶（なまめか）しさに成熟した女の匂いがあった。顔はあまり美しくはなかったが勿論早熟だった。母親は花柳界の女で、二三年前にある男に落籍（ひか）されて待合（まちあい）をやっていて、あきはそこから通学していた。

あきの性格は異常であった。彼女には他人の幸福が憎いのである。それが自分達と離れた世界の手のとどかないような感じの幸福であればある程それを許せない気持を持っていた。
プラトニックラブとか淡い初恋などといった文句は見ただけで虫ずが走つた。そんなものには縁がなかったからである。もう一つは非常に冷酷であった。この性質は子供の頃からであった。彼女の住む界隈（かいわい）では絶えず喧嘩があつた。金にからまる恨みから、或は面子（めんつ）の問題から、更に女出入の喧嘩は多かつたが、あきはそんな喧嘩を見るのを好んだ。

血の流れるような凄じいものであればある程わくわくとして昂奮で眺めていた。子供の頃友達と遊びの帰り途、廓（くるわ）の入り口で大きな喧嘩に出合い、外の子供達は恐れて逃げ帰ろうとする中にあきは平気でそれを眺めていた。その中の男の一人が腕をねぢ上げられ、妙な音を立てて骨が折れると、子供達は一せいに袂（たもと）で目を蔽つたが、あきはその音に恍惚としたような眼付で顔をゆがめて笑った。

そんなあきであったから、学校に入つてからは常に女王であった。女の世界にも暴力は通用するとは信じていたし、彼女の経験から又事実でもあつた。あきは常に憎み合い、呪い合うことのスリルを好んだ。若し男ならば背一杯の刺青で脇差一本をたよりに花を咲かせて見るのにと女に生れた不運をかこちさえした。
があきの住む世界では真剣に奴向ってくれる相手は無かつた。頬を一つ撲（う）てれば直ぐ泣いた。上級生でも髪の毛を持つてひきずり廻すと手をついて謝つた。そんな時にはあきは相手が弱けれ...

Kataya Kaoru / Tanabata Reiko (Illus.)

**Schoolgirl Lynching!**
**Schoolgirls Who Toy with Bodies**

With a small mountain behind it, a school building that never properly receives sun all year round; due to lack of drainage, a playground so narrow that puddles remain for two or three days after just one day of rain. This is the appearance of Seijo Girls' Academy. Because of management difficulties, the building cannot be repaired; glass is broken, siding is torn—it was a state of ruin unbefitting a girls' school. Kawashima Aki is a fourth-year student at that academy.

Aki is eighteen, but her tall stature and the swell of her chest did not make her look like a schoolgirl. Especially in a kimono with the collar lowered returning from the bath, in that sexiness there was the scent of a mature woman. Her face was not very beautiful, but of course she was precocious. Her mother was a woman of the "flower and willow world" (geisha world), who two or three years ago was ransomed by a certain man and was running an assignation house; Aki commuted to school from there.

Aki's personality was abnormal. To her, other people's happiness was hateful. The more it was a feeling of happiness in a world distant and unreachable from herself, the more she had an unforgiving feeling toward it. The phrases like "platonic love" or "faint first love"—just looking at them made her skin crawl. It was because she had no connection to such things. Another thing was she was extremely cold-hearted. This nature was from the time she was a child. In the neighborhood where she lived, there were constant fights. From resentment involving money, or problems of "face," and furthermore fights over women were many, but Aki liked watching such fights.

The more it was a gruesome thing like blood flowing, the more she watched with excitement and thrill. In childhood, on the way home from playing with friends, they encountered a big fight at the entrance of the "Kuruwa" (red-light district); while other children fled in fear, Aki watched it unperturbed. When one of the men's arms was twisted up and the bone broke with a strange sound, the children all covered their eyes with their sleeves, but Aki, with a look like ecstasy, distorted her face and laughed at that sound.

Because she was such an Aki, after entering school she was always the queen. She believed that even in the world of women, violence is effective, and from her experience it was also a fact. Aki always liked the thrill of hating each other and cursing each other. She even lamented the misfortune of being born a woman, thinking that if she were a man, she would "blossom" relying on a back full of tattoos and a single short-sword.
But in the world where Aki lived, there was no opponent who would face her seriously. If she struck a cheek once, they cried immediately. Even upperclassmen, when she grabbed their hair and dragged them around, they bowed their heads and apologized. At such times, the weaker the opponent was...

**The Schoolgirl Lynchings: Cruel Maidens Toying with Flesh**
By Kaoru Kataya / Illustrated by Reiko Tanabata

Seijo Girls’ Academy sat in the shadow of a small mountain, its halls forever denied the warmth of the sun. Poor drainage turned the cramped playground into a muddy swamp for days after a single rain. The school was a ruin; bankrupt and crumbling, with shattered windows and rotting siding, it looked more like a slum than an institution for young women. It was here that eighteen-year-old Aki Kawashima was a fourth-year student.

Despite her age, Aki’s tall, curvaceous frame betrayed no hint of the schoolgirl. When she walked home from the bathhouse in a kimono with the collar pulled low, she exuded the provocative aura of a fully ripened woman. She was not conventionally beautiful, but she was deeply precocious. Her mother, a former geisha, had been set up in an assignation house by a patron a few years back, and Aki commuted to school from this den of vice.

Aki possessed a twisted soul. She harbored a visceral hatred for the happiness of others. The more distant and unattainable that happiness seemed, the more she loathed it. Mere words like "platonic love" or "innocent romance" filled her with such disgust that her skin crawled; she had never known such things. Since childhood, she had been defined by a chilling cruelty. Growing up in a district fueled by blood feuds over money, pride, and women, she had developed a taste for watching violence.

The more blood that spilled, the more her heart raced with dark excitement. Once, as a child, she and her friends stumbled upon a brawl at the gates of the red-light district. While the other children fled in terror, Aki stood her ground, mesmerized. When a man’s arm was twisted until the bone snapped with a sickening crack, the other children hid their eyes behind their sleeves. Aki alone stood there, her face contorted into a smile of pure, ecstatic joy.

Naturally, Aki became the "queen" of her school. She believed that violence was the ultimate currency, even among women—a belief her own life had proven true. She thrived on the thrill of mutual hatred and spite. She often cursed the misfortune of being born female; had she been a man, she imagined she would have lived a glorious, violent life, adorned with Yakuza tattoos and a short-sword. But in her current world, no one dared stand up to her. A single slap across the face was enough to make her peers burst into tears. Even upperclassmen would fall to their knees in apology if she grabbed them by the hair and dragged them across the floor. In those moments, the weaker her victim was, the more...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** This is a classic example of "Ero-Guro" (Erotic-Grotesque) pulp fiction common in post-war Japan. The layout features a large, hand-drawn title in a bold, aggressive calligraphic style.
*   **Typography:** The title "女学生の私刑" (Schoolgirl Lynching) is designed to be eye-catching and shocking. The text is arranged in vertical columns (tategaki), with furigana used for difficult or specific readings (e.g., *rinchi* for *shikei*, *kuruwa* for *kuruwa*).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title dominates the top right, followed by the provocative illustration. The text begins with a description of the setting (the dilapidated school) before moving into the character study of the "femme fatale" protagonist.
*   **Illustration:** The artwork by Reiko Tanabata is typical of the "pin-up" style influenced by American pulps but adapted to Japanese tastes. The subject is lounging in a suggestive pose among grapes, symbolizing decadence and "ripeness," contrasting with the brutal text.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Pulp):** This likely dates from the late 1940s to the 1950s, the era of "Kasutori" magazines. These were cheap, sensationalist publications that flourished during the chaos of the post-war occupation, focusing on sex, crime, and social decay.
*   **Seijo Girls’ Academy:** The name "Seijo" (Holy Castle) is ironic, as the school is described as a decaying ruin.
*   **Karyūkai & Machiai:** Aki’s background is rooted in the "Flower and Willow World" (the geisha and sex industry). A *machiai* was a house where customers met geisha or lovers, often associated with illicit or "adult" dealings. Being the daughter of a woman in this trade marked Aki as "tainted" by society's standards of the time.
*   **Kuruwa (廓):** This refers to the walled-in red-light districts (like Yoshiwara). Aki growing up at the entrance to such a district explains her exposure to violence and "adult" reality from a young age.
*   **Gender Roles:** The text explores the subversion of the "S-class" or "shojo" (maiden) culture, which usually depicted schoolgirls as innocent and pure. Here, Aki is a "yaban" (savage) or "furyo" (delinquent) girl who rejects feminine softness and wishes for the violent life of a male Yakuza.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **私刑 (Shikei / Lynch):** Normally "private punishment," here given the furigana "Rinchi" (Lynching), emphasizing mob violence or extrajudicial cruelty.
*   **落籍 (Hikasareru /身請け):** To have one's debt paid by a patron to leave the geisha/prostitution world.
*   **待合 (Machiai):** An assignation house; a place for secret trysts.
*   **艶しさに (Namameshisa):** Sensuality, sexiness, or coquettishness.
*   **廓 (Kuruwa):** The red-light district.
*   **袂 (Tamoto):** The long, hanging sleeve of a kimono, often used to hide one's face or tears.
*   **脇差 (Wakizashi):** A short sword used by samurai and later associated with Yakuza gambling culture.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Sadism & Decadence:** The primary theme is the "abnormal" psychology of the protagonist. Her pleasure in the sound of breaking bones and her hatred of happiness are hallmarks of the "Guro" (grotesque) literary movement.
*   **Class & Environment:** There is a strong subtext of environmental determinism. Aki is cruel because she grew up in the "ruins" of a school and the violence of the red-light district. Her "precocious" body is a physical manifestation of her loss of innocence.
*   **The "Queen" Archetype:** Aki represents the "bad girl" who rules through fear. This was a popular trope in post-war media reflecting a breakdown in traditional moral authority.
*   **Anti-Romanticism:** The text explicitly mocks "platonic love," positioning the story as "adult" and "realistic" compared to sugary shojo fiction.
