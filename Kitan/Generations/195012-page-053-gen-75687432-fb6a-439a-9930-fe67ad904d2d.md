**世相諷刺**
**近頃の娘は老人がお好き**
**土岐 次郎**

る。それも恋文のやり取りをしている仲にまで進んでいるとすれば、眼の届かないところでは、どんな事が起きていたかもしれない。妻の貞操さえ疑わしくなつてきた。と同時に、あの真っ白い柔肌が、自分以外の男の手に触れられるのかと思うと、たまらない惜しさと、素晴らしい妻の魅力さえ感じるのだった。
　俊二はその夜、何食わぬ素振りで、ジツと葉子の動静を窺い、用事にかこつけて出て行く後から、密かに尾行していった。
　秋の澄みきった月光を浴びて、浮々として逢瀬に足音をはずませる、不貞の妻の後姿にムラムラと嫉妬と憤りに揺ぶられた。すると、約束の場所に来た時、葉子はクルリと振返って、バタバタと良人の胸許に走り寄って来た。
「あなた！……」小さく呼んで、いきなり物狂おしく俊二の軀に顔を埋めた。彼は解釈に困った。
「矢ッ張り来て下さったのね。嬉しいワ。あの手紙あんな嘘よ、出鱈目よ。幹夫に書いて貰ったの……許してね」
「何！　幹夫君に……？」
　その一言で、彼の疑惑はサラリと晴れた。訳を訊ねる必要もなかった。愛するがために必死となった、倦怠期打開のいちろしい心根に、思わず妻をいだき締めた。
「すまなかった、すっかり誤解していた。……そう云えば僕だって秘密探偵社の調査員を買収していたんだ。君を刺戟したいための皆んな作り話の報告さ」
「まあ」
　二人とも、黙ってしまった。
　二人とも、胸が熱くなった。
　良人も妻も、もう一度新婚当時の活々とした、愛情の鼓動を見たかったのだ。
「あら、綺麗なお月さまよ。ホラ…」
　そう云って二三歩早く歩きながら、月を眺める振りをして、葉子はそっと泪を拭いた。
「葉子！」

（中段・挿話的なダイアログ）
「アラ、お母さん」
「まあ、びっくりした。何より、この新聞御覧なさい。また親子心中があつたのよ」
「いやねー」
「やっぱり、今度のも生活難からだわ」
「みんな生活難ですよ。だから貧乏は大嫌い」
「お金持でなくちゃあ、でしょう」
「だから結婚する時には、財産家を選ばなければなりません」
「それは毎度お母さんから聞かされ、よく知ってるわ。さっきね、お母さん、あたしたちちょっと、お父さんに呼ばれたの」
「あ、そうそう、禿山さんの縁談じゃあない？」
「そうなの」
「で、お父さんは、どうおっしゃったの？」
「禿山さんがあたしと結婚したいんですって」
「それはお母さんも聞いています」
「禿山さん、随分御熱心なんですって。フフ」
「あれ、悦んでるわ、この子」
「だって、あたしを大好きなんですって、オホホホ」
「それでお父さんは？」
「秀山さんは大変な財産家だっておっしゃるの」
「そりゃあ大変な財産家だわ、あたしも知ってるわ」
「だから、お父さんは、あたしに結婚しろっていうんでしょう」
「駄目ですよ」
「あら、どうして？」
「いけません」
「だって、お母さんは、いつもそうおっしゃるじゃございませんか、お金持ちでなくちゃあ駄目だって」
「お父さんは、あんたをお嫁にやって、禿山さんからお金を借りようとなさるんですよ」
「あら、政略結婚ね、だけど、お父さんの事業のためになるなら、結構じゃありませんの」
「あら、あんた、あんなお年寄り」
「秀山さん、あんなお年寄り、びっくりする程のお齢なの？」
「六十二ですよ」
「お父さんよりもお年寄りなのね」
「よぼよぼのお爺さんじゃありませんか」
「そうかしら」
「のんきねえ、あんたは、で、お父さんにどう御返事したの。勿論お断りしたんでしょう？」
「いえ、あたし、それは結構です是非ともって……」
「あれまあ、呆れちゃうじゃありませんか」
「どうして？」
「結婚する気なのー」
「そうよ、財産が山程あって、六十二のよぼよぼの爺さんで、その上、あの方法、心臓がとても、お弱いんですであった」。

　彼は妻の泪を知ると、家まで我慢出来なかった。物蔭に呼んで犇と乳房を両腕を圏んだ。長い接吻が薄闇の中に、息を止めて交わされた。それは新婚以来はじめて見る。新たらな愛情の表現であった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Social Satire**
**Young Women These Days Like Old Men**
**Jirō Toki**

...If it had progressed even to the point of exchanging love letters, in a place where eyes cannot reach, what kind of things might have been happening? Even the wife's chastity became doubtful. At the same time, when thinking that that pure white soft skin might be touched by the hands of a man other than himself, he felt an unbearable sense of loss and even the wonderful charm of his wife.
Shunji that night, with an unconcerned manner, fixedly peeked at Yoko's movements, and using an errand as a pretext, from behind her going out, secretly went following.
Bathed in the clear autumn moonlight, at the back view of the unfaithful wife who made her footsteps bounce cheerfully toward a tryst, he was shaken by a swelling of jealousy and resentment. Then, when reaching the promised place, Yoko turned around with a whirl, and with a pitter-patter ran close to her husband's chest.
"You!..." she called small, and suddenly buried her face deliriously in Shunji's body. He was troubled by the interpretation.
"As I thought, you came for me. I'm happy. That letter, such a thing is a lie, it's nonsense. I had Mikio write it... please forgive me."
"What! By Mikio-kun...?"
With that one word, his suspicion cleared away smoothly. There was no need to ask the reason. At the pathetic heart that became desperate for the sake of love to break through the period of boredom, he unintentionally hugged his wife tight.
"I'm sorry, I misunderstood completely. ...Come to think of it, I too had bribed an investigator from a secret detective agency. It was all a report of made-up stories for the sake of wanting to stimulate you."
"Oh my."
The two of them became silent. Both of them, their chests became hot. Both the husband and wife wanted to see once more the lively heartbeat of affection from the time of their newlyweds.
"Oh, it's a beautiful moon. Look..."
So saying, while walking two or three steps faster, pretending to gaze at the moon, Yoko softly wiped her tears.
"Yoko!"

...When he knew of his wife's tears, he could not wait until home. Calling her into the shadows, he firmly encircled her breasts with both arms. A long kiss in the faint darkness was exchanged with held breath. That was, seen for the first time since being newlyweds, a new expression of affection.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Social Satire: The Modern Girl’s Fondness for Old Men**
**By Jirō Toki**

Shunji’s mind raced. If they were already at the stage of exchanging love letters, what on earth was happening behind his back? He began to doubt his wife’s very fidelity. Yet, the thought of another man’s hands roaming over her supple, porcelain skin filled him with a torturous mix of possessiveness and a renewed sense of her intoxicating beauty.

That night, Shunji feigned indifference. He watched Yoko’s every move with a hawk’s eye, and the moment she slipped out on the pretext of an errand, he followed her into the shadows. Under the crystalline light of the autumn moon, her back seemed to dance with the joy of a secret tryst. The sight of her—his unfaithful wife—sent waves of hot jealousy and bitter resentment surging through him. But when she reached their "meeting spot," Yoko spun around and threw herself into his arms.

"Darling! You came!" she whispered, burying her face against his chest with a desperate intensity. Shunji was stunned. "I knew you’d come. I'm so happy. That letter... it was all a lie, a complete fabrication. I had Mikio write it for me. Please, forgive me!"

"What? Mikio wrote it?"

In that single instant, the fog of suspicion vanished. He didn't need to hear another word. He realized the lengths she had gone to, out of a desperate, touching desire to rekindle the fire in their stagnant marriage. He pulled her into a fierce embrace.

"I’m the one who should apologize," he murmured. "I misunderstood everything. Truth be told, I had hired a private investigator and bribed him to write fake reports about my own exploits—just to make you jealous."

"Oh, Shunji..."

They stood together in silence, their hearts full. Both husband and wife had simply been searching for that pulse of passion they hadn't felt since their honeymoon. 

"Look, the moon is so beautiful tonight," Yoko said, stepping ahead and pretending to admire the sky while she discreetly wiped a tear from her eye. 

"Yoko!"

Unable to wait until they reached the privacy of their home, he pulled her into the shadows of the street and held her tight. In the dim light, they shared a long, breathless kiss—their first truly passionate embrace since they were newlyweds. It was the birth of a new kind of love.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a standard vertical-text (tate-gaki) format characteristic of Japanese periodicals. It is divided into three main columns, though the dialogue section in the middle is boxed or separated by decorative borders to distinguish it from the narrative prose.
*   **Typography:** The title is set in a bold, stylized font to grab attention. The body text uses a standard Mincho typeface. The use of furigana (reading aids) is minimal, suggesting an adult audience with at least a secondary education.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "Social Satire" (世相諷刺) acts as a series header, followed by the specific story title and author. The illustration is placed at the bottom left, providing a visual anchor that depicts the climax of the narrative.
*   **Illustration Style:** The artwork is a pen-and-ink drawing typical of the 1950s "pulp" or literary magazine style. It emphasizes emotion and drama, showing the couple in a romantic, slightly cinematic embrace.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses traditional Japanese punctuation, including brackets for dialogue (「 」) and leaders (……) for pauses.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s to mid-1950s (Early Post-war Shōwa). The mention of "life's hardships" (生活難) and "parent-child suicide" (親子心中) reflects the grim social reality of Japan following WWII, where poverty was rampant.
*   **The "Boredom Period" (倦怠期):** A common theme in post-war urban literature. As Japan modernized, the concept of "romantic love" within marriage became a popular topic for "middle-brow" (chūkan shōsetsu) fiction, often exploring how to keep passion alive.
*   **Private Detectives:** The mention of "secret detective agencies" (秘密探偵社) reflects the popularity of hard-boiled and mystery tropes in post-war media.
*   **The "New Girl" vs. Old Men:** The dialogue section satirizes a perceived social trend where young women might seek out wealthy older men ("Sugar Daddies") to escape the crushing poverty of the era. The name "Shuyama" (秃山) literally means "Bald Mountain," a comedic/satirical name for an unattractive old man.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **世相諷刺 (Seisō Fūshi):** Social satire. A common genre in magazines that used fiction to comment on contemporary manners and morals.
*   **いじらしい (Ijirashii):** Touching, pathetic (in a cute/arousing way), or admirable in a way that makes one want to protect them. Used here to describe the wife's desperate attempt to get attention.
*   **かこつけて (Kakotsukete):** Under the pretext of; using something as an excuse.
*   **逢瀬 (Ouse):** A tryst or secret meeting between lovers.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Performative Jealousy:** Both husband and wife are performing a "drama" of infidelity to provoke a reaction from the other. This suggests a critique of modern marriage as becoming stale or performative.
*   **Economic Anxiety vs. Romance:** The dialogue in the middle serves as a "reality check" to the romantic narrative. While the main couple finds love, the secondary conversation focuses purely on money and survival, suggesting that "romance" is a luxury that requires financial stability.
*   **The Power of the Gaze:** The story begins with the husband watching the wife, but ends with the wife "watching" the moon to hide her tears. It deals with the tension between what is seen (the appearance of infidelity) and what is felt (desperate love).
