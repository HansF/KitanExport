皆さんが面白い話しをしろつて仰言いますが、野暮な私にはんと皆さんに面白がつて頂くような話は持合せておりません。しかし先の語で、皆さんのお気に召すかどうか知りませんが、又こんな話を皆さんが本當になさるかどうか私は存じませんが、とにかくお慰みまでに喋らして頂きましよう

（１）
十年は一昔と申しますが、私が二十八の時のことですからもはやこれ三十年近くなります。その頃元氣だつた私は、百連の傍ら鐵砲をかついでよく山をかけまわつたものです。そして鳴やつくゞみ、さては兎、狸などを追つて随分面白い日を送つていました。
所がある日、仲のよい鐵砲仲間の二三人がやつてきて一つ黒熊山へ行かないかというのです。黒熊山とはその名のように熊はいませんがけれど猪がよく出るので、勿論猪をとりにゆく相談に来たのです血氣盛りの私が早速賛成したのは無論のことです。
黒熊山は皆さん御存じのようにこゝから三十里も北にある山です汽車もなかつた時分でしたから私たちは充分身拵えをして草鞋脚絆のいでたちで鐵砲片手に颯爽と出掛けて行つたものです。
さて目的地へつきましたが時期外れのためか一向猪らしいものに出喰しません。私たちはがつかりしましたが、手ぶらで歸るのは如何にも癪だと言も山奥へどん＼／入つて行きました。
さて森のはづれについて私たちは先づ休憩することにして見晴らしいい場所に腰を下しました咽喉が乾いたので水が欲しくなりましたが結果一番年若な私が水をくみに行くことになりました。
この邊はさすが人も余り来ない。と見えて雑草がのび放題です。その上、夜来の雨で道さえわからな。いのです。私はかすかなせゝらぎをたよりに草の根などにつかまりながらも一歩一歩谷間のほうへおりて行きました。

（２）
やがて眼下に飛沫を上げて流れる清冽な谷川がみえました。やれ嬉しやと私は道を急ぎました。處が道は必要以上に曲りくねつていて、いつまで行つても谷川のほとりへ辿りつけないのです。五十尺ほど下に水をみていながら私は下れなくなりました。そしてとうとう一切立つたような崖を一直線に下りることを考えました。
今でいえば随分無茶な話ですが若い私は葛の根などにつかまつてむり＼／と下りて行つたのでしょう所が十間ばかり降りた時でしようか、確かに大丈夫だと思つて足をかけた岩角がもろくもガクリと崩れたのです。アッと思つた時はもんおそい。足場を失つた私の体はこんどうつて石ころと一緒に谷底へ鞠のように轉落して行きました。
それつきり私は意識を失つてしまつたのです。それからどれ位の時間が立つたか知れません。私はふと眼をさましました。汚い家の中らしいのです。しかも私は藁園にねかされているのです。私はあわてゝ起き上ろうとしましたが忽ち悲鳴を上げて倒れました。足腰に針をさしたように痛むのです。すると私の聲をきいたらしく土間にいた一人の男が上つてきました。「やあ、気がついたか。よかつたよかつた。」
そういつて男は大きな口を開けて笑いました。男の話によると男が山からの歸り道、谷川のそばで倒れている私を發見して助けて我家までつれて来たんだそうです。男は獵を専門としてとつたものを麓の村へ賣つてその日を送つているということでした。
私が黒熊山へ獵に来たことをきくと男は別段驚きませんでしたが、まあ癒るまで休んで行きなさいとその顔に似ず優しく言つてくれました。私はすぐ出立するつもりでしたが体が言うことをきかず、身体が元氣になる迄この男の世話になることにしました。
男の住むこの家は極めて簡単な掘立小屋で四面を山にかこまれた窪地にありました。その上男は一匹の大きな牝猿を飼つていました。小さい時に生捕つたものだそうで、すがよくなれて放ち飼いにしてあつのに逃げもせず小屋の附近をいつも歩きまわつておりました。當座は變な顔をしていましたがすぐに私とも仲よくなつてしまいました。
やがて私の体もすつかり元通りになつたので私はいよいよ男とも別れることにしました。こゝで世話になつてからもう十日目です。
所がいよいよこの家を出ることになつて男と別れの挨拶やらお禮を言つていると、突然妙なうなり聲を上げてあの牝猿が私のまわりをうろつき始めました。
この牝猿は一寸大げさのようですが十才位の小供程あるのです。それがこうして嫌なうなり聲を立てて目をひからせているのですからさすがの私も余りいい氣持ではありません。
私は気になつて仕方がないのでこの妙な素振りの牝猿のことをたずねました。すると男はいうのには、いわゆる交尾期に入つたらしいのです。私も成程と思い、間もなく山を下りることになりましたけれど四五日もねていたせいか足腰がつよく。

皆さんが面白い話をしろとおっしゃいますが、野暮な私には、皆さんに面白がって頂くような話は持ち合わせておりません。しかし先の話で、皆さんのお気に召すかどうか知りませんが、またこんな話を皆さんが本当になさるかどうか私は存じませんが、とにかくお慰みまでに喋らせて頂きましょう。

（１）
十年は一昔と申しますが、私が二十八の時のことですからもはやこれ三十年近く（前）になります。その頃元気だった私は、一挺（いっちょう）の鉄砲を担いでよく山を駆け回ったものです。そして百舌（もず）や、つぐみ、さては兎、狸などを追って随分面白い日を送っていました。
ところがある日、仲の良い鉄砲仲間の二三人がやってきて「一つ黒熊山へ行かないか」というのです。黒熊山とはその名のように熊はいませんが、けれど猪がよく出るので、勿論、猪を獲りに行く相談に来たのです。血気盛んな私が早速賛成したのは、無論のことです。
黒熊山は皆さんご存じのように、ここから三十里も北にある山です。汽車もなかった時分でしたから、私たちは十分身拵えをして、草鞋（わらじ）に脚絆（きゃはん）の出で立ちで、鉄砲片手に颯爽と出掛けて行ったものです。
さて目的地へ着きましたが、時期外れのためか一向に猪らしいものに出くわしません。私たちはがっかりしましたが、手ぶらで帰るのはいかにも癪だと、山奥へどんどん入って行きました。
さて森の外れに着いて、私たちはまず休憩することにして見晴らしのいい場所に腰を下ろしました。喉が渇いたので水が欲しくなりましたが、結局一番年若な私が水を汲みに行くことになりました。
この辺はさすがに人もあまり来ない（と）見えて、雑草が伸び放題です。その上、夜来の雨で道さえ分からないのです。私は微かなせせらぎを頼りに、草の根などに掴まりながらも一歩一歩、谷間の方へ下りて行きました。

（２）
やがて眼下に飛沫を上げて流れる清冽な谷川が見えました。「やれ嬉しや」と私は道を急ぎました。ところが道は必要以上に曲がりくねっていて、いつまで行っても谷川のほとりへ辿り着けないのです。五十尺（約15メートル）ほど下に水を見ながら、私は下れなくなりました。そしてとうとう、切り立ったような崖を一直線に下りることを考えました。
今で言えば随分無茶な話ですが、若い私は葛（くず）の根などに掴まって、無理矢理に下りて行ったのでしょう。ところが十間（約18メートル）ばかり降りた時でしょうか、確かに大丈夫だと思って足をかけた岩角が脆くもガクリと崩れたのです。アッと思った時はもう遅い。足場を失った私の体は、転倒して石ころと一緒に谷底へ鞠（まり）のように転落して行きました。
それきり私は意識を失ってしまったのです。それからどれ位の時間が経ったか知りません。私はふと目を覚ましました。汚い家の中らしいのです。しかも私は藁の上に寝かされているのです。私は慌てて起き上がろうとしましたが、忽ち悲鳴を上げて倒れました。足腰に針を刺したように痛むのです。すると私の声を聞いたのか、土間にいた一人の男が上がってきました。「やあ、気がついたか。よかった、よかった。」
そう言って男は大きな口を開けて笑いました。男の話によると、男が山からの帰り道、谷川のそばで倒れている私を発見して助けて、我が家まで連れて来たんだそうです。男は猟を専門として、獲ったものを麓の村へ売ってその日を送っているとのことでした。
私が黒熊山へ猟に来たことを聞くと男は別段驚きませんでしたが、「まあ治るまで休んで行きなさい」とその顔に似ず優しく言ってくれました。私はすぐに出立するつもりでしたが、体が言うことを聞かず、身体が元気になるまでこの男の世話になることにしました。
男の住むこの家は極めて簡単な掘立小屋で、四面を山に囲まれた窪地にありました。その上、男は一匹の大きな牝猿（めすざる）を飼っていました。小さい時に生け捕ったものだそうで、非常によく懐いて、放し飼いにしているのに逃げもせず、小屋の付近をいつも歩き回っておりました。当座（初め）は変な顔をしていましたが、すぐに私とも仲良くなってしまいました。
やがて私の体もすっかり元通りになったので、私はいよいよ男とも別れることにしました。ここで世話になってから、もう十日目です。
ところがいよいよこの家を出ることになって男と別れの挨拶やお礼を言っていると、突然妙な唸り声を上げて、あの牝猿が私の周りをうろつき始めました。
この牝猿は、一寸大袈裟のようですが十歳くらいの子供ほど（の大きさ）あるのです。それがこうして嫌な唸り声を立てて目を光らせているのですから、さすがの私もあまりいい気持ちではありません。
私は気になって仕方がないので、この妙な素振りの牝猿のことを尋ねました。すると男が言うには、いわゆる交尾期に入ったらしいのです。私もなるほどと思い、間もなく山を下りることになりました。けれど四五日も寝ていたせいか足腰が...

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
Everyone says "tell an interesting story," but to a rustic person like me, stories that everyone would find interesting, I do not have in my possession. However, in the words spoken before, whether it suits your tastes I do not know, and whether you all will take such a story as truth I do not know, but anyway, for the sake of diversion, let me chatter.

(1)
Ten years is "an old tale" (one decade) they say, but since it was when I was twenty-eight, it already becomes nearly thirty years ago. In those days when I was energetic, alongside a hundred (others?), carrying a gun I often ran around the mountains. And chasing shrikes, thrushes, and then rabbits, tanuki, etc., I spent quite interesting days.
However, one day, two or three close hunting companions came and said, "Shall we go to Mt. Kurokuma?" Mt. Kurokuma, like its name, has no bears, but because boars often appear, of course, they came to consult about going to take boars. That I, full of vigor, immediately agreed was a matter of course.
Mt. Kurokuma is, as you all know, a mountain thirty ri (approx. 120km) north of here. Because it was a time when there were no trains, we made sufficient preparations and in the outfit of straw sandals and leggings, with guns in one hand, we gallantly set out.
Well, we arrived at the destination, but perhaps because it was out of season, we did not encounter anything boar-like at all. We were disappointed, but saying it was truly irritating to return empty-handed, we went deeper and deeper into the heart of the mountains.
Well, reaching the edge of the forest, we decided to first take a rest and sat down in a place with a good view. Because throats became parched, we wanted water, and in the end, I, the youngest, ended up going to fetch water.
This area, as expected, people hardly come to. It appeared so, and weeds are growing as they please. Moreover, due to the rain since last night, even the path is not known. I, relying on a faint murmuring of a stream, while clutching at grass roots and such, step by step went down toward the valley.

(2)
Eventually, below my eyes, I saw a clear mountain stream flowing and throwing up spray. "Oh, joy," I hurried my way. However, the path was more winding than necessary, and no matter how long I went, I could not reach the bank of the stream. While seeing the water about fifty shaku (15m) below, I became unable to descend. And at last, I thought of descending a sheer cliff in a straight line.
Speaking by today's standards, it is quite a reckless story, but young me, clutching at kudzu roots and such, likely went down forcibly. However, was it when I had descended about ten ken (18m)? The corner of a rock I stepped on, thinking it was certainly okay, collapsed brittly with a "gakuri." When I thought "Ah!" it was already late. My body, having lost its footing, tumbled down toward the valley floor like a ball along with pebbles.
After that, I lost consciousness. Since then, how much time passed I do not know. I suddenly woke up. It seemed to be inside a dirty house. Moreover, I am being laid on a straw bed. I hurried to try to stand up, but immediately let out a scream and fell. My legs and hips pained as if needles were stuck in them. Then, seemingly having heard my voice, one man who was in the dirt floor area came up. "Hey, you've come to? Good, good."
Saying so, the man laughed opening a large mouth. According to the man's story, on the man's way back from the mountain, he discovered me collapsed by the stream, saved me, and brought me to his house. The man specialized in hunting, and was spending his days selling what he took to the village at the foot of the mountain.
When he heard that I came to Mt. Kurokuma for hunting, the man was not particularly surprised, but said kindly, unlike his face, "Well, stay and rest until you heal." I intended to depart immediately, but my body would not listen, so I decided to be in this man's care until my body became energetic.
This house where the man lived was an extremely simple shack, located in a depression surrounded on four sides by mountains. Furthermore, the man kept one large female monkey. It was something he caught alive when it was small, and it was very well-tamed; though he kept it free-range, it did not flee and was always walking around the vicinity of the shack. At first, it made a strange face, but soon it became friends with me too.
Eventually, my body also completely returned to its former state, so I finally decided to part with the man. It is already the tenth day since being in his care here.
However, when it finally came to leaving this house and I was saying parting greetings and thanks to the man, suddenly raising a strange growling voice, that female monkey began to prowl around me.
This female monkey—it seems a bit of an exaggeration—but is about the size of a ten-year-old child. Because it is thus making a nasty growl and making its eyes shine, even I, as expected, am not in a very good mood.
I could not help but be concerned, so I asked about this strange behavior of the female monkey. Then, what the man said was, it seems she entered the so-called mating season. I also thought "I see," and shortly after, I was to go down the mountain. However, perhaps because of sleeping for four or five days, my legs and hips... [Text ends/continues]

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
Everyone asks me to spin a yarn, but I’m a simple man and don’t have much in the way of stories that would entertain a crowd like you. Still, based on what was said earlier, I’ll rattle on for your amusement—though whether it suits your fancy or whether you believe a word of it is anyone's guess.

(1)
They say ten years is an age, but this was when I was twenty-eight—nearly thirty years ago now. I was full of beans back then, and I used to spend my days roaming the mountains with a shotgun, chasing after shrikes, thrushes, and the occasional rabbit or tanuki. It was a grand old time.
One day, a couple of my hunting buddies came by and suggested a trip to Mt. Kurokuma. Despite the name, you won't find any bears there, but it's thick with wild boar. Being young and eager, I jumped at the chance to join them.
Mt. Kurokuma is about 120 kilometers north of here. This was before the trains reached that far, so we geared up with straw sandals and leggings and set off gallantly, shotguns in hand.
We reached our destination, but maybe because it was the wrong season, we didn't see hide nor hair of a boar. We were gutted, but the thought of going home empty-handed was too much to swallow, so we pushed deeper into the wilderness.
Reaching the edge of a forest, we decided to take a breather at a spot with a decent view. We were parched, and being the youngest, the chore of fetching water fell to me.
The area was clearly untouched by man; the weeds were waist-high and overgrown. To make matters worse, the previous night's rain had washed away any sign of a trail. Guided only by the faint babble of a brook, I picked my way down toward the valley floor, clinging to roots for balance.

(2)
Finally, I spotted the spray of a cold mountain stream below. Relieved, I hurried down, but the path wound around so pointlessly that I couldn't seem to reach the bank. There was the water, just fifteen meters below me, but no way down. In a fit of recklessness, I decided to take a straight shot down a sheer cliff face.
It sounds like madness now, but I was young; I grabbed onto some vines and started shimmying down. I must have made it about twenty meters when the rocky ledge I’d put my weight on gave way with a sickening crack. I didn't even have time to shout before I was airborne. I lost my footing and went tumbling down the gorge like a stray ball, bouncing off the rocks until I hit the bottom.
I blacked out instantly. I don't know how long I was out, but when I came to, I was inside a dingy shack, lying on a bed of straw. I tried to scramble up, but a sharp, needle-like pain shot through my hips and legs, and I collapsed with a cry. Hearing me, a man who had been working on the dirt floor came over. "Oh, you're awake? Good, good," he said with a wide, toothy grin.
He told me he'd found me crumpled by the stream on his way back from the mountain and carried me home. He was a professional hunter who made his living selling his kills to the village at the foot of the mountain.
He wasn't much surprised to hear I'd been hunting Mt. Kurokuma, and despite his rough looks, he kindly told me to stay until I'd mended. I wanted to leave right away, but my body wouldn't have it, so I ended up in his care.
His home was a primitive shack in a hollow surrounded by peaks. He kept a large female monkey there—he'd caught her as a baby and she was perfectly tame. He let her roam free, and she never strayed far from the hut. At first, she looked at me suspiciously, but she soon warmed up to me.
Ten days passed, and once I felt like my old self again, I prepared to say my goodbyes. But as I was thanking the man and getting ready to leave, that monkey suddenly started circling me, letting out this bizarre, low growl.
She was a big one—no exaggeration, she was about the size of a ten-year-old child. Hearing that nasty growl and seeing her eyes glinting at me... well, it didn't sit right with me at all.
Uneasy, I asked the man about her strange behavior. He just shrugged and said she’d likely come into heat. I suppose that made sense, but as I started the trek down the mountain, my legs felt heavy—perhaps from being bedridden for so long...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Format:** The text is presented in a classic mid-20th century Japanese magazine layout. It uses vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The title "奇譚クラブ夜話" is written in a stylized, hand-drawn font that evokes a sense of mystery or folklore. The body text uses a standard serif font common in letterpress printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the largest element, followed by the section markers (1) and (2). There is a circle (〇) at the start of the preamble, a common convention to denote an introduction or editorial note.
*   **Illustration:** A small, delicate line drawing at the bottom left depicts a mountainous landscape with a small hut and a person, mirroring the narrative's setting. The style is somewhat nostalgic, reminiscent of Taisho-era or early Showa-era illustrations.
*   **Structure:** The story is broken into a preamble (introduction) and numbered chapters. This "story within a story" framework (a narrator telling a story to an audience) is a classic literary device.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Kitan Club (奇譚クラブ):** First published in 1946, this was a legendary magazine that specialized in "strange tales," ranging from folklore and mystery to the erotic and grotesque (*ero-guro*). It was a staple of "pulp" culture in post-war Japan.
*   **Mountain Folk/Hunters:** The setting of a lonely hunter (*matagi*-like figure) living in a remote shack is a recurring trope in Japanese "mountain man" (*yama-otoko*) legends. These stories often involve supernatural or boundary-blurring encounters.
*   **The "Strange Monkey" Trope:** In Japanese folklore, monkeys are often seen as liminal beings. The specific mention of a large female monkey entering its "mating season" and behaving aggressively toward a human male introduces a subtle element of horror or sexual unease common in *Kitan Club* stories.
*   **Measurement Units:** The text uses traditional Japanese units: *Ri* (里, approx. 3.9km), *Shaku* (尺, approx. 30cm), and *Ken* (間, approx. 1.8m). This anchors the story in a pre-modern or early modern rural setting.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **野暮 (Yabo):** "Unrefined" or "rustic." Here, the narrator uses it as a form of self-deprecation.
*   **百連 (Hyakuren?):** In the original, it's written "百連の傍ら". It likely refers to a "hundred-shot" rifle or a specific group of hunters, though "一挺" (iccho - counter for guns) is more common. It could also be a misprint or archaic slang for a double-barrelled shotgun.
*   **颯爽 (Sassō):** Gallantly, dashingly. It reflects the romanticized view of hunting in the narrator's youth.
*   **草鞋脚絆 (Waraji-kyahan):** Straw sandals and leggings. This was the standard attire for mountain travel and manual labor before rubber boots and modern hiking gear became common.
*   **掘立小屋 (Hordage-goya):** A "dug-out" or "post-in-ground" hut. It implies a very primitive, temporary, or poor dwelling.
*   **交尾期 (Kōbiki):** Mating season (specifically for animals). Its use here adds a primal, slightly disturbing tone to the monkey's behavior.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Nature vs. Civilization:** The narrator moves from the "civilized" world (planning a trip, wearing gear) into a "wild" space where he loses control (the fall) and is saved by a man who lives entirely outside society.
*   **The Uncanny (The Monkey):** The monkey serves as the "uncanny" element. It is "almost human" (size of a child, tame), but its animal instincts (the growl, the heat) create a sense of threat and revulsion in the narrator.
*   **Physical Vulnerability:** Much of the story focuses on the narrator's broken body and his helplessness. In *Kitan Club* fiction, this vulnerability often sets the stage for a psychological or supernatural ordeal.
*   **Nostalgia:** The preamble frames the story as a memory from "thirty years ago," creating a distance that allows the "strangeness" of the events to feel more plausible to the reader.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story), Folklore/Strange Tale (Kaidan).
*   **Tags:** Mountains, Hunting, Survival, Animals (Monkey), Mystery, Pulp Fiction, Post-war Literature.
*   **Classification:** Entertainment/Adult (due to the magazine context and subtle sexual subtext).
