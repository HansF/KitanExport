## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Model having become man
Nagae Yoshihei (Author)

"Me, is it?"
So saying, [he] stood up.
"Eh?" "What about?"
"The gentleman was waiting, I believe."
"Who?"
"Eh, I myself do not know, you see."
Yoshimura with lightly-suspicious eyes that woman looking up at, was looking back. However looked at, night-time just-barely-made-it-in-time looking kimono pattern, however looked at, twenty-two, three years old look, but truly how old having become perhaps not know.
Furthermore, Yoshimura seemed about to shout something.
"Together with whom, exactly?"
"That is rude."
"You, as a woman speaking between priests me perhaps think. The gentleman is not such a limit, I believe." "Increasingly strange it was."
"Ikkyū-dono, what is it?"
"You do not know, you see." "Of 'Butsun' the ending syllable 'pun' or similar having included, some defiant looking not-seen-like woman it is."
"Yoshimura was increasingly strange."
"Well, ho, ho. The gentleman someone quickly hearing-out does, but I myself do not know, you see."
"Separately nothing concealing I will not do, you see, I."
"Just a moment."
"You, as a woman speaking between priests me perhaps think. The gentleman is not such a limit, I believe."
Yoshimura received a counterattack.
"Why, such an unclean person thinking of, gentleman's dignity to." "It changes, you see, one thing becoming big for me." "Yes."
"Tonight's this place... Me, as someone's acquaintance you do not know?"
"Therefore, separately, something out of curiosity, I will do." "Yes." "You (the woman) are?" "Mhm."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Man Who Became A Model**
**By Nagae Yoshihei**

“Me, you mean?”
He stood up.
“Huh? What are you talking about?”
“I believe the gentleman was waiting.”
“Waiting for who?”
“Well, I certainly wouldn't know that.”

Yoshimura stared back at the woman with skeptical eyes. Judging by the pattern of her kimono, which looked as though she had barely managed to dress in time, and her appearance—perhaps twenty-two or twenty-three—it was impossible to tell how old she truly was.

Yoshimura looked as though he was about to burst out yelling.
“Waiting with whom, exactly?”
“That’s rather rude.”
“Are you perhaps assuming I view you as a woman who merely talks between priests? I’m sure a gentleman like yourself wouldn’t go that far.”
“This is getting stranger and stranger.”

“Ikkyū-dono, what is it?”
“You don’t know her?”
“She’s a woman whose speech ends with a ‘pun’—or something similar—a type of woman who doesn't come across as especially defiant, but still gives that impression.”
“Yoshimura was increasingly perplexed.”
“Well, ho, ho. The gentleman certainly presses people quickly for information, but I really don’t know anything myself.”
“I’m not keeping anything secret from you, believe me.”
“Hold on a second—”
“Are you perhaps assuming I view you as a woman who merely talks between priests? I’m sure a gentleman like yourself wouldn’t go that far.”

Yoshimura was taken aback by the counterattack.
“To even suggest such an unclean individual—that insults a gentleman’s dignity!”
“That changes things. One thing leads to another, you see.”
“Yes.”
“You don’t recognize me as someone’s acquaintance here tonight?”
“So, then, I'm just curious, that’s why I asked.”
“Yes.”
“And you (the woman) are?”
“Mhm.”

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is presented in a traditional Japanese format typical of magazines or literary journals published in the mid-20th century (likely 1940s-1960s).

**Format and Structure:**
1.  **Vertical Writing (Tategaki):** The text flows from top to bottom, right to left.
2.  **Title and Byline:** The title, **モデルになつた男 (The Man Who Became a Model)**, is centered above the text block in large type. The author’s name, **長柄 芳平 (Nagae Yoshihei)**, is situated immediately below the title, slightly smaller.
3.  **Visual Element:** A small, black-and-white illustration (depicting a stylized heart shape with two figures reaching toward it, separated by a star symbol) is placed visually next to the title, indicating the beginning of the piece and adding a thematic element of romance or drama.
4.  **Column Layout:** The main text is structured in two columns, although the column break is implicit based on the space provided.
5.  **Typography:** The font is Minchō style, characteristic of early 20th-century Japanese printing. The lines are slightly uneven, suggesting letterpress printing or an older offset method.
6.  **Dialogue:** Dialogue is clearly marked using Japanese quotation marks (鉤括弧, 「」).
7.  **Archaic Kana:** Historical kana usage is present, notably **つ** (tsu) instead of the small sokuon **っ** (e.g., なつた, やつな, 思つてらつしやう). The particle **は** is sometimes used phonetically as *wa* and **へ** as *e*. The kana **ゐ** (i) is also present (e.g., 見返してゐた).

**Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the largest element, followed by the body text, which is primarily dialogue, giving the piece a quick, dramatic reading pace. The frequent line breaks and short lines amplify the confrontational tone of the dialogue exchange.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Publication Era (1940s–1960s):** The use of historical kana orthography (**歴史的仮名遣い**, *rekishiteki kanazukai*) strongly suggests this text was published before 1946, or, more likely, in the early post-war period (late 1940s to early 1950s) when older printing styles were still common, especially in literary circles, even though the standard orthography reform had been enacted. The story's focus on tense, immediate, and somewhat mysterious urban encounters aligns with the themes of insecurity and social change prevalent in post-war Japanese fiction (e.g., the breakdown of traditional social roles, the rise of modern anonymity).

**"Woman Who Speaks Between Priests" (僧に言ふ間の女):** This phrase (僧に言ふ間の女, *sō ni iu aida no onna*) is the most complex cultural reference. It implies a specific social role or—more likely, given the negative context—a slanderous reputation. This could refer to:
1.  **A Go-Between or Mediator:** A woman who professionally mediates discussions or transactions involving Buddhist priests (monks/temple affairs).
2.  **A Woman of Questionable Morals:** Historically, women associated too closely with male religious figures (especially in private settings) could be viewed suspiciously. The phrase might be an antiquated euphemism for a type of mistress, courtesan, or woman involved in illicit activities related to temples or religious patrons. The woman's heated reaction confirms it is an insult tied to her reputation.

**Ikkyū-dono (一休どの):** This is a direct reference to Ikkyū Sōjun (1394–1481), one of Japan's most famous and eccentric Zen Buddhist monks. Ikkyū was known for his sharp wit, unconventional behavior, and often scandalous life, blending serious Zen study with earthly pleasures. Calling someone "Ikkyū-dono" in this context is likely a sarcastic nickname, implying the person (Yoshimura, perhaps) is overly witty, eccentric, or perhaps a know-it-all, especially after the woman's cryptic speech.

**Tone of Interaction:** The dialogue is extremely polite yet aggressive, using formal address (貴人, 貴女, 貴男) while exchanging veiled insults and accusations. This reflects a period where traditional politeness intersected with the abrasive directness of modern psychological drama.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**Theme 1: Mistrust and Misinterpretation**
The entire scene is driven by profound miscommunication and suspicion. Yoshimura is convinced the woman is not who she seems, judging her by her attire and cryptic dialogue. The woman, in turn, believes Yoshimura is making assumptions about her character (the "woman who speaks between priests" accusation). Both parties are locked in a battle of hidden identities and expectations.

**Theme 2: Appearance vs. Reality (Identity Crisis)**
The text explicitly notes the woman's age is questionable ("twenty-two or three... or maybe older") and her kimono looks hastily assembled. This focus on superficial signs (clothing, mannerisms, speech ending in "pun") highlights the theme of masking true identity, a common element in post-war literature reflecting social anxiety and flux. The title itself, *The Man Who Became a Model*, suggests that identity is artificial or performative.

**Theme 3: Social Judgment and Dignity**
The woman's defensive repetition of the phrase regarding the priests emphasizes the immediate and damaging power of social reputation. Yoshimura's counter-insult about "unclean subjects" and "gentleman's dignity" underscores the class or status conflict at play. The confrontation is not just about facts, but about maintaining or destroying perceived social standing.

**Tone and Rhetoric:**
The tone is taut, intellectual, and slightly noirish, characterized by rapid-fire, stylized dialogue. The use of highly formal but contextually inappropriate language (like *Ikkyū-dono*) adds a layer of ironic theatricality to what is essentially an argument over who is waiting for whom. The subtext suggests a possible clandestine meeting, perhaps an affair or a business deal, that has gone immediately sour.
