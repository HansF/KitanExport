２０　文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き

殺された者こそ、いい迷惑である。
　彼に対する秀吉の処罰も惨虐をきわめ、秀次は高野山で切腹、彼に従って、不破万作等、美小姓たちも後を追った。
　秀吉の怒りは、それでもやまわず、秀次が勢力にまかせて各地から集めた美女や、その間に出来た公達三十余人も殺害し畜生塚を築いた。その女性達の中には、親類で愛妾となっていた者もあり、また、わざわざ奥州から呼び寄せられて、やっと京都へ着いた時には秀次が失脚した後で、仕えもせぬうちに十束一からげに河原に引き出され、足、首所を異にした十六才の少女もいた。
　これ等三人は、みな代表的な暴君といわれる人達であるがその虐殺ぶりは、それぞれ特徴があって、紂王はいかにも大陸的であり、武烈天皇は原始的であり、秀次は野性的である。
　しかし彼等が共通して行なったことが、一つある。それは妊婦の腹を截ち割った、ということである。
　ここ四、五年、本誌では女淫の切腹の話が盛んに掲載されている。
　確かに、花もはじらう美しい乙女が、白い腹部をあらわにして、氷の刃を突き立てて自害をして行くのは、悲壮の極みであるが、これが任意に行われる妊婦の腹裂きは、一層あわれである。しかも、切腹をした女性たちは、あれは何の某と、人々からうわさされたことであろうが、腹を裂かれた女達の名前は、一人として残っていないのも一層あわれである。彼女たちは「路傍の石」が足蹴にされるように、偶然に”タイラント”の目に止まって、何等の抵抗を示す余裕も与えられずに、そのなぐさみものにされてしまったのである。その点、三十三年八月号で、壬生三郎氏が、「切腹風土記」の中で尚書や資治通鑑、奥羽永慶軍記、甲越軍記等から例を引いて書いておられるのには敬服した。私はそんなむずかしい本は分らないから、歌舞伎や浄瑠璃や、小説からいくつかの例を引いてみようと思う。

河竹黙阿弥作「月梅薫朧夜（つきのうめかおるおぼろよ）」というのは、有名な花井お梅の芝居であるが、この中に、紂王の腹裂きの場がある。
　紂王の家臣、杜元銑は、紂王の悪政に対していろいろと諫言したため手討ちとなる。その妻、柳条は前婦の子、柳眉、自分の実子、玉瑞、翠子の三女と、懐妊中の胎児がいる。
　紂王の妻、妲妃は、病と称してうかぬ顔をしている。紂王がなぐさめると、自分の病気は、私の人型を作って呪っている者がいるためで、それは杜元銑の妻、柳条であるという。紂王が怒って、すぐに柳条と、その三女を召し捕らせる。柳条は手ひどい拷問をうけ、ついに無実の咎を白状する。
紂王　過言せし故、杜元銑を、手討ちにせしを遺恨に思い、呪咀調伏致すとは、思えばにっくき其の女、いかなる刑に行いくれん。
家来一　先ず第一が炮烙死刑、又は毒虫を入れ置きし穴へ・落して喰い殺させるか。
家来二　かれは懐妊いたし居れば、腹さき刑に行うのが適当と存じます。
紂王　これ妲妃、いかなる刑に行なおうな。
妲妃　わらわを呪いし憎き柳条、腹裂きがようございましょう。
家来一　又子供等は穴へ打ち込み、
家来二　蛇や蜥蜴に喰わしてくりよう。
柳条　ええ、すりや私が腹を裂き、子供は穴へ打ちこんで蛇や蜥蜴に喰わすとか。

20 Ventral Slitting of Women appearing in Literature

The ones who were killed are the ones truly inconvenienced.
Regarding him, Hideyoshi's punishment also reached the height of cruelty; Hidetsugu committed seppuku at Mt. Koya, and following him, Fuwa Mansaku and others, the beautiful pages, also followed him in death.
Hideyoshi's anger did not stop even then; the beautiful women Hidetsugu had gathered from various places using his power, and the thirty-some young lords born in the meantime, were also murdered, and a "Beast Mound" (Chikushō-zuka) was built. Among those women, some were relatives who had become concubines, and there was also a sixteen-year-old girl who had been specially summoned from Oshū, and by the time she finally reached Kyoto, it was after Hidetsugu had fallen from power, and before she could even serve, she was dragged out to the riverbank as part of a batch, and had her feet and neck separated in different places.
These three (King Zhou, Emperor Buretsu, Hidetsugu) are all people said to be representative tyrants, but in their way of massacring, each has characteristics; King Zhou is indeed "continental" (Chinese-style), Emperor Buretsu is primitive, and Hidetsugu is wild.
However, there is one thing they performed in common. That is, they slit open the bellies of pregnant women.
For these last four or five years, in this magazine, stories of women's erotic seppuku have been frequently published.
To be sure, a beautiful maiden who puts even flowers to shame, baring her white abdomen and plunging an icy blade to commit suicide, is the height of the tragic and sublime, but this pregnant woman belly-slitting performed against her will is even more pitiful. Furthermore, while the women who committed seppuku were likely rumored by people as "so-and-so," the names of the women whose bellies were slit have not remained, not even one, which is even more pitiful. They, like "stones by the roadside" being kicked, happened to catch the eye of a "tyrant," and without being given the leeway to show any resistance, they were made into objects of amusement. In that regard, I admired that in the August Showa 33 issue, Mr. Mibu Saburō, in "Seppuku Fudoki," wrote citing examples from the Book of Documents, Zizhi Tongjian, Ou Eikei Gunki, Kōetsu Gunki, etc. Since I do not understand such difficult books, I think I will try to cite some examples from Kabuki, Jōruri, and novels.

Kawatake Mokuami's work "Tsuki no Ume Kaoru Oboroyo" is a famous play about Hanai Oume, but in this, there is a scene of King Zhou's belly-slitting.
King Zhou's retainer, To Gensen, was executed by hand because he gave various admonishments against King Zhou's misgovernment. His wife, Ryūjō, has a step-daughter Ryūbi, her own biological daughters Gyokuzui and Suiko, and an unborn fetus in her womb.
King Zhou's wife, Daji, is making a gloomy face, claiming to be ill. When King Zhou comforts her, she says her illness is because there is someone making a human effigy of her and cursing her, and that person is To Gensen's wife, Ryūjō. King Zhou becomes angry and immediately has Ryūjō and her three daughters arrested. Ryūjō undergoes terrible torture and finally confesses to the false charge.
King Zhou: Because he spoke excessively, I executed To Gensen; thinking of him resenting that and performing curses and subjugation, that hateful woman, what kind of punishment shall I perform?
Retainer 1: First, the punishment of "Horaku" (burning pillar), or dropping her into a hole where poisonous insects are kept to be eaten to death?
Retainer 2: Since she is pregnant, I believe it is appropriate to perform the punishment of belly-slitting.
King Zhou: Hey, Daji, what kind of punishment shall we do?
Daji: For the hateful Ryūjō who cursed me, belly-slitting would be good.
Retainer 1: Also, the children shall be thrown into the hole,
Retainer 2: And we shall have snakes and lizards eat them.
Ryūjō: Eh, then my belly is to be slit, and the children thrown into a hole to be eaten by snakes and lizards?

**20: The Ventral Slitting of Women in Literature**

It is the victims, of course, who suffer the ultimate misfortune. 
Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s retribution against his nephew Hidetsugu was the height of cruelty. Hidetsugu was forced to commit ritual suicide at Mount Koya, and his beautiful young pages, including Fuwa Mansaku, followed him into death. Yet Hideyoshi’s wrath was not satiated. He proceeded to slaughter the thirty-odd children Hidetsugu had fathered, as well as the many beautiful women Hidetsugu had gathered from across the land, interring them all in a mass grave known as the "Beast Mound" (*Chikushō-zuka*). Among these women were relatives who had become his concubines, and even a sixteen-year-old girl summoned all the way from the northern provinces. By the time she reached Kyoto, Hidetsugu had already fallen; before she could even begin her service, she was dragged to the dry riverbed like a piece of refuse and decapitated.

The three figures often cited as archetypal tyrants—King Zhou of Shang, Emperor Buretsu, and Hidetsugu—each had their own style of slaughter. King Zhou’s was characteristically "continental" in its scale, Buretsu’s was primitive, and Hidetsugu’s was primal and wild. However, they all shared one horrific practice: the slitting open of pregnant women's bellies.

In recent years, this magazine has frequently featured accounts of women’s eroticized ritual suicide (*seppuku*). Certainly, there is a tragic beauty in the image of a maiden, lovely enough to make flowers blush, baring her pale midriff to plunge a cold blade into herself. Yet, the forced evisceration of a pregnant woman is far more piteous. While those who chose *seppuku* might have their names whispered in hushed tones by posterity, not a single name of these victims remains. Like "stones by the roadside" kicked aside, they merely happened to catch a tyrant's eye and were toyed with as a cruel diversion, granted no chance to resist. I was deeply impressed by Mr. Saburō Mibu’s scholarly article "Seppuku Fudoki" in our August 1958 issue, where he cited historical texts like the *Book of Documents* and the *Zizhi Tongjian*. Lacking the stomach for such heavy tomes, I shall instead draw examples from the more accessible worlds of Kabuki, puppet theater, and popular fiction.

One such example is found in Kawatake Mokuami’s play *Tsuki no Ume Kaoru Oboroyo* (The Fragrant Plum on a Hazy Night). Though primarily about the famous murderess Hanai Oume, it contains a scene depicting King Zhou’s cruelty. 
When the retainer To Gensen is executed for criticizing King Zhou’s tyranny, his wife Ryūjō is left with three daughters and an unborn child. King Zhou’s consort, Daji, feigns illness and claims she is being cursed via a straw effigy made by Ryūjō. Enraged, King Zhou arrests Ryūjō and her daughters. After brutal torture, she "confesses" to the false crime.

**King Zhou:** "To think that woman would hold a grudge for my execution of To Gensen and attempt to curse me! How should I punish such a hateful creature?"
**Retainer 1:** "Perhaps the 'Burning Pillar' or casting her into a pit of venomous insects?"
**Retainer 2:** "Since she is with child, I believe the punishment of belly-slitting is most fitting."
**King Zhou:** "Tell me, Daji, what punishment do you desire?"
**Daji:** "Belly-slitting would be perfect for the wretch who dared curse me."
**Retainer 1:** "And the children shall be cast into the pit."
**Retainer 2:** "To be devoured by snakes and lizards."
**Ryūjō:** "What?! You mean to slit my belly and throw my children to the serpents?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** Standard vertical Japanese text (tategaki) arranged in two main columns per page.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard Mincho (serif) typeface. The heading "文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き" is centered at the top of the page.
*   **Page Number:** The number "20" is placed in the upper right corner, indicating this is part of a longer series or a feature article in a magazine.
*   **Structure:**
    *   The first part is an editorial/essay introduction providing historical context (Hideyoshi/Hidetsugu).
    *   The second part transitions into a literary analysis, specifically discussing a Kabuki play.
    *   The bottom section uses a script-like format (dialogue cues with the character's name followed by their speech) to quote the play.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is prominent, followed by a lead-in that links historical "facts" with literary depictions. The use of quotes and bold/indented dialogue sections helps distinguish the primary text from the quoted play.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Toyotomi Hidetsugu & the Beast Mound:** In 1595, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered his nephew and heir Hidetsugu to commit suicide. Following this, Hideyoshi ordered the public execution of Hidetsugu's entire family (wives, concubines, and children)—nearly 40 people—at Sanjō-kawara in Kyoto. Their bodies were thrown into a mass grave labeled "Chikushō-zuka" (Beast Mound or Mound of the Brutes). This event is legendary for its extreme cruelty and marked a turning point in public perception of Hideyoshi.
*   **King Zhou of Shang & Daji:** Based on the Chinese classic *Investiture of the Gods* (Fengshen Yanyi), King Zhou is the archetypal "last bad emperor" whose cruelty was spurred on by his concubine Daji (who was actually a fox spirit). The "belly-slitting" of a pregnant woman to "see what a fetus looks like" is one of the classic atrocities attributed to him.
*   **The "Ero-Guro" Movement:** This text reflects the mid-20th-century Japanese fascination with "Erotic Grotesque Nonsense" (Ero-Guro-Nansensu). While the movement peaked in the 1920s-30s, it saw a resurgence in post-war "pulp" magazines (like *Kitan Club* or various "true story" magazines) that blended historical trivia with sensationalist, often violent or sexualized themes.
*   **Publication Era:** The text mentions "Showa 33" (1958), suggesting this article was written shortly thereafter (late 50s to early 60s). This was a period when Japan was grappling with its recent violent history while consuming sensationalized media as entertainment.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **腹裂き (Hara-saki):** Literally "belly-slitting." Distinct from *seppuku* (ritual suicide) in that it is an involuntary execution method or a torturous act of curiosity.
*   **畜生塚 (Chikushō-zuka):** "The Beast Mound." A historical site in Kyoto where the victims of the Hidetsugu purge were buried. The name implies they were treated like animals rather than humans.
*   **美小姓 (Bikoshō):** "Beautiful pages." Male youths who served lords, often in a sexual capacity (*shudō*).
*   **十束一からげ (Jissoku-ichikarage):** An idiom meaning "lumping things together" or "treating everything as a single batch," used here to describe the indiscriminate nature of the executions.
*   **炮烙 (Horaku/Pao-lao):** A legendary Chinese torture method involving a heated bronze pillar.
*   **呪咀調伏 (Juso-chōbuku):** Rituals intended to curse or subdue an enemy through supernatural means.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Tyranny and Power:** The text explores the absolute power of "tyrants" (*tairanto*) and the helplessness of their victims.
*   **Gendered Violence:** There is a clear focus on violence against women. The author makes a distinction between the "tragic beauty" of a woman choosing *seppuku* and the "pitifulness" of forced evisceration. There is a voyeuristic subtext typical of the genre, where female suffering is analyzed as a "feature" of history and literature.
*   **Erasure of Identity:** A recurring theme is that while the tyrants are remembered, the names of their female victims are lost to time, compared to "stones by the roadside."
*   **The "Aesthetic" of Cruelty:** The author categorizes types of massacre (Continental, Primitive, Wild), treating historical atrocities with a detached, almost academic interest that borders on the fetishistic.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay, Literary Criticism, Historical Non-fiction (Sensationalist).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Kabuki, Cruelty, Gendered Violence, Folklore, History, Showa Era, Eroticism/Grotesque.
*   **Classification:** Mature/Adult (due to graphic descriptions of violence).
