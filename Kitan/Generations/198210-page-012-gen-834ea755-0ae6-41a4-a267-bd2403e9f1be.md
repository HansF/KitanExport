## Literal English Translation

It must have been severe torment.
I understood well the shame that threatened to kill the young woman, Koshi.
Ignoring her agony, soon a large wooden torture chair was brought in, and Koshi’s struggling, flailing feet were opened left and right, and she was bound to the chair.
“Gen, bring water.” The water brought by the henchman was forced by Jūzō into Koshi’s mouth. When I opened my eyes without limit [as widely as possible], Koshi was swelling up [plump] directly in front of me, and her whole body was wet as if soaked in rain.

Koshi’s bound figure, writhing in agony and shame, her body unable to move, was visibly undulating.
(32)

She was wet as if soaked in rain. Koshi had started to feel the urge to urinate. This was unavoidable since she had been forced to drink an incredible amount of water and was stripped naked in a cold basement. At first, she tried to endure it by wiggling her hips and putting strength into her toes, but then:
“...Please, let me go to the restroom [latrine], ahh...”
Koshi forgot her sense of shame and pleaded toward her current enemy in a voice like a mosquito buzzing.

I quietly opened my eyes and looked at Koshi. Koshi, still seated in the torture chair, her breasts heaving, struggling to breathe and panting *seisei*, while her entire body’s muscles twitched *piku piku* reflexively. Perhaps because she had been forced to drink the water, the gentle curve of her abdomen was different from usual, swelling oddly *puttsukuri*, and her whole body was wet as if soaked in rain.

## Literary English Translation

It must have been grueling torment.
I understood clearly the depth of shame that threatened to kill the young woman, Koshi.
Disregarding her anguish, a large wooden interrogation chair was soon brought in. Koshi’s flailing, struggling legs were spread wide to the left and right and secured tightly to the chair.
“Gen, bring water.” Jūzō then forced the water, brought by the henchman, directly into Koshi’s mouth. When I opened my eyes wide, Koshi stood before me, plump and swollen, her entire body damp as if drenched in rain.

Koshi’s bound form, overcome by agony and shame, her body incapable of movement, was visibly rippling.
(32)

Her body was soaked as if in rain. Koshi began to feel the urgent need to urinate. This was inevitable, having been forced to drink such an immense quantity of water while stripped naked in a cold underground room. At first, she attempted to hold back, wiggling her hips and tensing her toes, but then she pleaded:
“...Please, allow me to go to the latrine, ahh...”
Koshi forgot her very sense of shame, begging her current tormentor in a voice faint as a mosquito.

I quietly opened my eyes to observe Koshi. Still seated in the torture chair, her breasts struggled to breathe, panting *seisei*, while the muscles across her body twitched reflexively. Perhaps due to the forced hydration, the usual smooth curve of her belly was replaced by an abnormal, sudden plumpness, and her whole body was damp as if soaked in rain.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Ero-guro/S&M short fiction (物語) or highly fictionalized pseudo-reportage (記録). The clinical, observational tone points towards S&M genre fiction prevalent in the magazine. |
| **Author Attribution** | Not explicitly provided in the excerpt, but the text is framed as a first-person narrative (私/watashi). |
| **Editorial Voice** | Absent. The voice is entirely the narrator's/perpetrator's perspective, focusing on the victim's physical and psychological breakdown. |
| **Narrator Voice** | Detached, clinical, and sadistic observer. He explicitly states he is ignoring her agony (*katsumaen wo yoso ni* / 苦悶をよそに) and meticulously details her physical reactions (muscle twitching, swelling, shame). |
| **Target Audience** | Male readership interested in power dynamics, bondage (shibari), female humiliation, and sexual/bodily torture scenarios (ero-guro). |
| **Positioning** | The page number (32) and the continuous narrative suggest this is deep within a running story, possibly a serialized work or a substantial feature piece. |
| **Key Characters** | **喬子 (Koshi):** The victim, referred to as *wakai musume* (young woman). **私 (Watashi):** The observer/perpetrator. **重造 (Jūzō)** and **源 (Gen):** Assistants or secondary perpetrators. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Theme | Annotation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ero-Guro Genre** | The entire passage exemplifies the *ero-guro nansensu* (erotic, grotesque, nonsense) movement prominent in the 1920s–1950s/60s pulp magazines. It fetishizes clinical torture and the total collapse of feminine dignity. |
| **Torture Chair (拷問椅子)** | A standard prop in S&M/torture narratives, emphasizing confinement, helplessness, and the inability to maintain proper posture—a key element in humiliating the victim. |
| **Forced Hydration & Urination** | Water torture/forced drinking combined with cold exposure (cold basement/nakedness) is a common element of psychological and physical torture in these stories, specifically targeting the control of bodily functions (the *haijo no kutsū*, pain of excretion), which maximizes shame (*shūchi*). |
| **Sexual Mores / Shame (*Shūchi*)** | In mid-20th-century Japanese society, female modesty and control over one's body were paramount. The total inability to control urination or maintain shame, leading to public begging, represents the ultimate violation of social and gender norms, which is precisely the source of the narrative's tension and erotic charge for the narrator. |
| **Language of Pain** | The victim's voice is reduced to a *ka no naku you na koe* (voice like a mosquito buzzing)—a metaphor emphasizing her utter powerlessness, frailty, and the trivialization of her suffering in the eyes of the perpetrators. |
| **Physical Descriptions** | Descriptions like the abdomen "swelling oddly" (*puttsukuri*) and the body "wet as if soaked in rain" (雨に濡れたように) are euphemisms or clinical observations intended to eroticize the physical effects of the torture (likely wetting herself, or sweat induced by pain/shame). |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Japanese) | Translation / Contextual Meaning | NLP Note / Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 責苦 (*sekku*) | Torment, severe suffering. | Formal term for persecution or torture. |
| 羞しさ (*hazukashisa*) / 羞恥 (*shūchi*) | Shame, embarrassment, humiliation. | Central emotional axis of the genre. Loss of *shūchi* signals total defeat. |
| 拷問椅子 (*kyōmon isu*) | Torture chair, interrogation chair. | Specific S&M prop, implies planned, institutional cruelty. |
| 無限り (*mukagiri*) | Without limit, limitlessly. (Used as an adverb for extent). | Old-fashioned or literary usage, meaning "as widely as possible" (when describing opening eyes). |
| ツクリ (*puttsukuri*) | Swollen, plump (onomatopoeia). | Describes the abdomen swelling due to forced drinking or urine retention. Eroticization of physiological distress. |
| 尿意 (*nyōi*) | Urge to urinate. | Clinical term, used directly to heighten the realism/intensity of the humiliation. |
| 御不浄 (*gofujō*) | Restroom, latrine. (Literally: unclean place). | Polite, slightly archaic euphemism for the toilet, highlighting the contrast between polite request and brutal circumstances. |
| セイセイ (*seisei*) | Panting, sighing sound (of painful breath). | Onomatopoeia indicating difficult, constrained respiration, likely due to tight bondage and distress. |
| ピクピク (*piku piku*) | Twitching, spasms. | Onomatopoeia describing involuntary muscular movement, emphasizing her physical helplessness and loss of control. |
| 腹部の曲線 (*fukubu no kyokusen*) | Curve of the abdomen/belly. | Highly specific, aesthetic description focusing on the female form being altered by torture. |

## Themes & Subtext

| Theme | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Eroticization of Suffering** | The narrator finds the victim’s agony (*kutsū*), shame (*shūchi*), and physical breakdown intensely gratifying. The goal is the *death* of her shame (死ぬ程の羞しさ). |
| **Control and Power** | The sequence moves from physical restraint (chair) to environmental control (cold basement, nakedness) to physiological control (forced drinking). The final sign of control is forcing her to beg to perform a taboo bodily function. |
| **Voyeurism and Observation** | The narrator's role is strictly observational ("I opened my eyes and looked at Koshi," "I understood well the shame"). He is analyzing her body (breasts, belly, muscle twitches) as clinical evidence of the success of the torture. |
| **The Inevitability of Collapse** | The victim attempts resistance (wiggling hips, tensing toes) but this is depicted as futile. Her ultimate collapse is signaled by forgetting shame and begging—the complete submission of her will. |
| **Bodily Alteration** | The description of the abdomen swelling and the body being wet creates a grotesque image of a body under stress, emphasizing the violation of the natural, "normal" female form. |
