私は農家の長男で、本家といふ重荷を背負ひつ
つ、性慾の捌け口に苦しんで居りました。

村の娘達は皆、他家に嫁ぎゆく身体。さうでなけ
れば、私〔わたくし〕の嫁になる者か、或は、嫁の

妹などでしたから、手出しは許されません。

ある年の秋、小作人の娘であつた「みつ」が、母
の病気で働けなくなり、私の家の奥で奉公をする
事になりました。みつは十と七つ。まだ痩せて

居りましたが、その身体つきは、もう女でした。

私は、主人の権威を盾に、夜な夜な彼女の部屋へ

通ひ、無理にその清き処女を奪つたのです。

みつは泣いて懇願しましたが、私を拒むことは

出来ませんでした。主従関係は絶対なのです。

## Literal English Translation

I was the eldest son of a farming family, and bearing the heavy burden called the main household (honke), I was suffering regarding an outlet for my sexual desire.

All the village daughters were bodies destined to marry off to other houses. If not, they were those who would become my own bride, or else, the younger sister of my bride, and so, intervening (touching) was not permitted.

In the autumn of a certain year, "Mitsu," who was the daughter of a tenant farmer, could no longer work due to her mother's illness, and she came to serve (hōkō) in the depths (oku) of my house. Mitsu was ten and seven years old. She was still thin, but her physique was already that of a woman.

I, using the authority of the master as a shield, went to her room night after night, and forcibly took her pure virginity.

Mitsu cried and pleaded, but she was unable to refuse me. The master-servant relationship is absolute.

## Literary English Translation

I was the eldest son of the farming family, burdened with the heavy responsibilities of the main household, and troubled by the lack of any proper outlet for my sexual cravings.

All the available girls in the village were bodies destined to marry into other families. Those who were not were either designated as my future bride or perhaps the sister of my wife—meaning they were strictly off-limits to me.

One autumn, Mitsu, the daughter of one of our tenant farmers, became unable to work due to her mother's illness. She came instead to serve as a maid in the inner quarters of my home. Mitsu was seventeen. Though still slender, her body had already matured into womanhood.

Using the authority of the master as my shield, I visited her room night after night and forcibly seized her pure maidenhead.

Mitsu cried and begged me to stop, but she could not refuse. The relationship between master and servant is absolute.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader confession (*Dokusha Kōhaku* / 読者告白) or perhaps a report on rural sexual taboos (*Kishū Hōkoku* / 奇習報告), common formats in *Kitan Club* that allowed for the publication of non-legalistic, sensational descriptions of sexual exploitation.
*   **Author Attribution:** Anonymous male reader, identifying only by his role: "Eldest Son of the Honke" (農家の長男).
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** The narrator adopts a formal, self-justifying tone, presenting his actions as the inevitable result of his heavy social burden and the rigid constraints of the village structure. The final, absolute statement ("主従関係は絶対なのです") functions as the narrator's ultimate legal and moral defense.
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in forbidden narratives concerning rural aristocracy, class inequality, sexual dominance, and the ritualistic violation of virginity. The language is heightened and formal despite the criminal content.
*   **Positioning within the magazine:** Likely a feature segment focusing on "real life" sexual deviance, providing contrast or backup material to the main fictional pieces.

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Honke (本家, Main Household):** In the pre- and early post-war agricultural structure, the *Honke* held immense social and economic power over local branch families and *kosakunin* (tenant farmers). The narrator emphasizes the "heavy burden" to justify his transgression, a common psychological defense mechanism linked to the pressure of maintaining lineage and tradition.
*   **Kosakunin (小作人, Tenant Farmer):** Individuals who rented land from the landlord (*jinushi*). Their financial and personal lives were entirely dependent on the landlord class, making their families highly vulnerable to exploitation. This text draws directly on this intense, feudal power dynamic, though this structure was officially reformed post-1945.
*   **Hōkō (奉公, Service):** A traditional arrangement where poor families sent children (especially girls, *meshi-taki*) to serve wealthier households. These servants often lived in the *Oku* (inner quarters), isolated and unprotected, making them prime targets for sexual abuse by the male head or heir.
*   **Shūjū Kankei (主従関係):** The Master-Servant Relationship. This phrase is used as the non-negotiable legal/social basis for the sexual assault. It reflects a time when lower-class individuals, especially servants, had virtually no legal recourse against the patriarchal head of a wealthy household.
*   **清き処女 (Kiyoki Shojo):** The emphasis on "pure virginity" highlights the commodity status of the girl. Taking it is not just a sexual act but a definitive act of conquest and ownership over the lower class.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **性慾の捌け口 (Seiyoku no Hakeguchi):** Outlet/Vent for sexual desire. A mechanistic, clinical description of sexual necessity, minimizing the human interaction involved.
*   **本家といふ重荷 (Honke to iu Omoni):** "The heavy burden called the Honke." Used to rationalize the narrator's moral lapses—the pressure of status justifies the release of desire.
*   **手出し (Tedashi):** Lit. "Lending a hand/intervening." Euphemism for making sexual advances or engaging in sexual relations.
*   **奥 (Oku):** Inner, private quarters of the house. Often associated with women's domains, but here signifies the isolation of the maid.
*   **十と七つ (Tō to Nanatsu):** Seventeen years old. A traditional, less modern way of stating age.
*   **処女を奪つた (Shojo o Ubatta):** "Forcibly took/stole her virginity." A straightforward but blunt verb choice for non-consensual deflowering.

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Dominant Themes:** Sexual violence, class oppression, patriarchy, rural stagnation, entitlement, and the fragility of female honor/purity.
*   **Implicit Fantasies/Anxieties:** The text fulfills the voyeuristic fantasy of absolute social and sexual power (the master being immune to refusal). It also explores the anxiety associated with the *Honke* role—the perceived duty to maintain social order while simultaneously feeling entitled to break personal taboos.
*   **Ero-Guro / Pulp Tropes:** This is a classic violation narrative centered on **Shojo Zeme** (virgin violation/torment), framed within a highly traditional Japanese setting (the farming household). The clinical description of the victim's tears followed immediately by the justification of absolute hierarchy enhances the sensational, grotesque aspect.
*   **What is suggested but not stated:** The text strongly implies that the master-servant relationship provides a permanent, hidden source of sexual gratification for the protagonist ("night after night"). The lack of consequence for the assault suggests that the social structure effectively condones the crime.

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual content (type & intensity):** High (Explicit description of serial non-consensual sexual penetration/rape).
*   **Violence:** Moderate (Implied physical force and extreme psychological coercion).
*   **Coercion:** Severe (Systemic exploitation based on dependency and absolute class hierarchy).
*   **Medical / bodily themes:** Virginity, physical maturity.
*   **Taboo or illegal implications:** Rape, abuse of authority, violation of vulnerable persons.
