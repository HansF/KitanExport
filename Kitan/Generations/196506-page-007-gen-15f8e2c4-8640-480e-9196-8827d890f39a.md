**カメラ・ハント志望**
**「こんな私いかが？」**
　　　　　堺市　**大谷勢津子**

恋しき辻村隆様――。
　勿論辻村様にお淑やかで、御理解のある奥様がいらっしゃる事を承知で、こう呼び掛けずにはおられない私でございます。お許し下さいませ。過去十八冊の奇クが、私を辻村様の虜にしたのでございます。
　私は二十二才、独身でございますが、処女であるとは申し上げません。フトした事で許し合った男性が過去におりますが今は関係ありません。故郷は長崎ですが集団就職で大阪へ出て、最初の会社は期待外れで一年でやめ、堺の工業関係の会社の事務をとっております。去年の暮、会社の寮を出て、お友達二人と下宿する様になりましたので、体の自由はききます。
奇クも現在下宿の方へ直接送って戴いておりますので、以前の様に羞かしい思いをして店頭で買わずに済みますので助かります。
　辻村隆様――。思い切って申し上げます。一度でよろしゅうございますから、私をモデルに使って頂けませんか。今迄の奇クのグラビアは全部きりとって、アルバムに貼ってあり、最近二度ばかり編集部にお願いして、分譲写真を送っていただきましたが、フォトを見るたびに私の胸は弾み、何かわわけもなく体中がカアーッ と熱くなってまいります。そして自分も一度でいいから、こんな風に縛られて、羞かしめられたい気持ちにかられてなりません。それには紳士でいられる辻村様にお願いするのが、私の夢を叶えてくれる最も手近な方法と考えついた次第でございます。私の希望は次に申上げるようなプレイでございます。
　一、私のストッキングかパンティを口の中に押しこんでその上から猿縒（形式的でなくほんとうに）をし、乳首を細縄に挟んで強く縛って、乳首だけが、ポックリと突き出たようにする。
　二、同じ様な猿縒で、私の両手足を背で一纏めにして縛り、徐々に体を吊り上げて、かろうじて、胸の隆起でささえている。
　三、乳首にクリップを挟んで責める（私の乳首は大きい方で、小指の第一関節ぐらいあります）細針で突くとか、毛抜きでつまんで引張る。
　四、乳首にクリップ（強いバネのもの）をはさんで、それに鎖をとりつけ、いろいろのおもしをブラ下げる。
　五、両の乳首を細紐で強く縛って抜けないようにして、左右の乳首を胸の中央で一緒に縛る。胸のふくらみは大きいから、私が自分でやった時つきました。
　大体、右に書きましたように、私は乳房、特に乳首に激しい責めを加えるのを好みます。その刹那が、私にとって一番生き甲斐があります。同宿のアツコを誘いこんでこの乳首プレイの対象にしています。若し辻村様にお願いを叶えていただけたら、アツコを口説き落して御紹介し、いつかアツコと二人でとって戴ける日を夢見ています。

私は22歳、独身でございますが、処女であるとは申し上げません。ふとしたことで許し合った男性が過去におりますが、今は関係ありません。故郷は長崎ですが、集団就職で大阪へ出て、最初の会社は期待外れで一年で辞め、堺の工業関係の会社の事務をとっております。去年の暮れ、会社の寮を出て、お友達二人と下宿するようになりましたので、体の自由はききます。

**Camera Hunt Aspirant**
**"How about a me like this?"**
Sakai City — **Setsuko Otani**

To my dear Takashi Tsujimura—.
Of course, I am aware that you, Mr. Tsujimura, have a graceful and understanding wife, yet I cannot help but call out to you like this. Please forgive me. The past 18 issues of *Kiku* [Kitan Club] have made me your captive.
I am 22 years old and single, but I will not say I am a virgin. There was a man in the past with whom I shared myself due to a chance occurrence, but there is no relationship now. My hometown is Nagasaki, but I came to Osaka via collective hiring (*shudan shūshoku*). The first company was disappointing so I quit after one year, and now I handle office work for an industrial company in Sakai. At the end of last year, I left the company dormitory and began boarding with two friends, so I have freedom over my body.
I also have *Kiku* sent directly to my lodgings now, so it helps that I no longer have to buy it at the storefront while feeling embarrassed as I did before.
Mr. Takashi Tsujimura—. I will speak boldly. Even just once is fine, would you please use me as a model? I have cut out all the gravure [photo] pages from *Kiku* so far and pasted them in an album. Recently, I asked the editorial department twice to send me "distributed photos" (*bunjō shashin*), and every time I look at the photos, my heart leaps, and for some reason, my whole body becomes flushed and hot. And I cannot help but be driven by the feeling of wanting to be tied up and humiliated like that myself, just once. I decided that asking you, Mr. Tsujimura, who can remain a gentleman, would be the most accessible way to make my dream come true. My desires are for the following types of "play":

1. Stuffing my stockings or panties into my mouth, and over that, performing a *sarugutsumi* [monkey-gag/bind] (not just formally, but for real), then catching the nipples in thin rope and tying them tightly so that only the nipples bulge out prominently.
2. With a similar *sarugutsumi*, tying my hands and feet together behind my back, gradually hoisting my body up, barely supporting [the weight] with the protrusion of my chest.
3. Torturing the nipples by pinching them with clips (my nipples are on the large side, about the size of the first joint of the pinky finger). Pricking them with thin needles or grasping and pulling them with tweezers.
4. Attaching clips (ones with strong springs) to the nipples, attaching chains to them, and hanging various weights.
5. Tying both nipples tightly with thin cord so they don’t slip out, and tying the left and right nipples together at the center of the chest. Since my breast volume is large, they reached [each other] when I tried it myself.

Generally, as I have written to the right, I prefer intense torture being applied to my breasts, especially the nipples. That moment is, for me, what makes life most worth living. I have enticed my roommate Atsuko and made her a subject of this nipple play. If you would grant my wish, Mr. Tsujimura, I will talk Atsuko into it and introduce her, dreaming of the day when you might take photos of the two of us together.

## 4️⃣ Literary English Translation

**Aspirant for the "Camera Hunt"**
**"Would a Woman Like Me Suit Your Lens?"**
**Setsuko Otani** (Sakai City)

To the Dearest Takashi Tsujimura—
I am well aware, of course, that you have a refined and dutiful wife at home. Yet, knowing this, I find I simply cannot restrain myself from reaching out to you. I beg your forgiveness. It is the eighteen back-issues of *Kitan Club* I’ve devoured that have made me your utter captive.

I am twenty-two and currently single. I won’t pretend to be a virgin; there was a man once, a brief indiscretion, but he is long gone. I’m originally from Nagasaki, part of the wave of young workers brought to Osaka for employment. My first job was a letdown, so I moved on after a year and now work as a clerk for a manufacturing firm in Sakai. Since moving out of the company dorm last winter to share an apartment with two girlfriends, I finally have the "freedom of my own body," so to speak.

The magazine is now delivered straight to my door. It’s a relief; I no longer have to endure the burning shame of buying it at a newsstand. 

Mr. Tsujimura, I must be bold: please, if only for a single session, would you take me as your model? I’ve painstakingly clipped every gravure spread from the magazine and kept them in a private album. I’ve even ordered specialty prints from the editors. Every time I look at them, my heart thrashes in my chest, and a sudden, inexplicable heat flushes through my entire being. I am overcome by a desperate urge to be bound, to be humiliated just as those women are. I realized that the surest way to realize this fantasy was to appeal to a true gentleman like yourself. 

These are the "plays" I dream of:
First, to have my own stockings or panties stuffed deep into my mouth, secured with a "monkey-bind"—and I mean a real one, not just for show. Then, to have my nipples caught in thin cords and cinched so tight they bulge out like ripe fruit. 
Second, while in that same gag, to have my limbs lashed together behind my back and my body hoisted into the air, until my entire weight is suspended, barely balanced by the protrusion of my chest. 
Third, the torment of the clips. My nipples are quite large—nearly the size of a pinky's first joint. I want them pricked with fine needles or stretched with tweezers. 
Fourth, to have heavy-spring clips attached to my nipples, with chains dangling various weights from them. 
Finally, to have both nipples bound with cord and then lashed together at the center of my chest. I’ve tried this myself, and because I’m well-endowed, I was able to make them meet.

As you can see, my desires center on the breast—specifically, the application of intense "discipline" to the nipples. In those moments of sensation, I feel truly alive. I’ve already begun involving my roommate, Atsuko, in these games. If you agree to see me, I’m certain I can persuade her to join us. I dream of the day you might photograph both of us together.

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** This is a "Reader's Submission" or "Model Application" letter, a staple of the *Camera Hunt* (カメラ・ハント) column.
*   **Context:** In the 1950s and 60s, *Kitan Club* acted as a bridge between amateur photographers and readers willing to model for fetishistic photography. 
*   **Persona:** The writer presents herself as a *shokuba-otome* (workplace maiden)—a clerical worker. This "average girl next door" persona with a hidden, extreme fetish was a primary trope of the genre.
*   **Tone:** The language is highly formal (*Keigo*), using humble forms to address the photographer/editor. This creates a sharp contrast between her polite social standing and the "shameful" (masochistic) desires she describes.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

*   **集団就職 (Shūdan Shūshoku):** "Collective hiring." A post-war phenomenon (peaking in the 1950s-60s) where graduates from rural areas (like Nagasaki) were brought to industrial hubs (like Osaka/Sakai) in groups to provide cheap labor. It marks her as part of the working class.
*   **奇ク (Kiku):** A common abbreviation for *Kitan Club* (奇譚クラブ), the most famous magazine of the "Kasutori" (pulp) and fetish era.
*   **Camera Hunt (カメラ・ハント):** This was a specific subculture where amateur photographers sought out "real" women (not professional models) for erotic or bondage sessions. It was often framed as a "scientific" or "artistic" pursuit of "true" female psychology.
*   **Privacy & Social Shame:** Her mention of the embarrassment of buying the magazine at a storefront and the relief of moving out of a company dorm highlights the intense social surveillance of young women's morality at the time.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **猿縒 (Sarugutsumi / Monkey Bind):** A specific style of gagging/binding, often involving a cord passed through the mouth and tied behind the head, sometimes including the limbs.
*   **分譲写真 (Bunjō Shashin):** "Distributed/Subdivided photos." Magazines would often sell extra prints or more explicit shots of their models directly to readers via mail order.
*   **「形式的でなくほんとうに」:** "Not formally/ceremonially, but truly." She is emphasizing that she wants functional, tight bondage, not just loose "aesthetic" ropes for the camera.
*   **ポックリ (Pokkuri):** Onomatopoeia for something popping out or being shapely/swollen.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Humble" Masochist:** The writer finds empowerment in submitting to a "gentleman" (紳士). By asserting her specific fetishes (especially nipple torture), she is actually directing the scene she wishes to be the victim of.
*   **The Roommate (Atsuko):** This is a common trope in these letters—the "corrupting" of a friend or the "homosocial" bonding through shared taboo activity. It serves as a "teaser" for the editor (two models for the price of one).
*   **Geography of Desire:** Moving from the rural, traditional Nagasaki to the industrial, anonymous Osaka/Sakai allows her to explore her sexuality away from family eyes.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** High (Explicit descriptions of nipple torture, bondage, and oral gags).
*   **Fetishes:** Bondage (Shibari), Masochism, Breast/Nipple torture (Pinching, Piercing-adjacent, Weight-bearing), Gagging.
*   **Dynamics:** Submission, Consensual (expressed intent).
*   **Violence:** Non-consensual simulation (Humiliation/Shame).
