## Literal English Translation

That is the human heart, and one should know it.
The deep heart disposition that should be concealed (kaku-subeki),
If this is exposed (abaku-subeki), it should be sung about and spread,
And the heart, easily shifting to things, should be admonished.
Things whose color is visible and decaying (tsurofu) exist in this world.
The human heart is like a flower turned into white, polished paper (neriginu),
If dyed, it takes color, and brought into the light (hi no me),
It becomes visible. There are various desires of the ear, mouth, and nose,
And it is not only due to sexual lust (inyoku) that one covets wealth (tomi).
Hiding one's shame (haji) is also all due to desire.
One should deeply exercise caution and fear concerning sufficient things (taru koto).
Even lack of desire (muyoku) is lack of desire only if it is not a deeply greedy heart.
The song that teaches knowing sufficiency:

Yielding, and letting go.
The water of the mountain well
That relates to me.

○ Constant loyalty and fidelity (teichū) that should be protected,
One should know the sacredness toward the truly fearful heart,
And bestow it. In antiquity,
Caution was valued, knowing the affairs of the abyss,
And constantly wishing for (being cautious) as if treading deep ice (fukaki kōri wo fumu ga gotoshi),
If one errs, they will certainly err, they said.
The wife serving a man should be sheltered by her husband,
And regarding things she has not encountered by chance, and also regarding
The necessary deportment (tachi-i) to protect one's body,
It must be as if approaching the abyss and treading thin ice, they said.
○ Naming you "Yo" is not
A name I affixed. It is related to the Mori clan,
And related to the Mura clan, if kept secret,
It should be permissible (yuru aru beshi).
This is the virtue of a woman; if she can truly return to one,
There are four practices (yotsu no okonai).
It is not merely the virtue of a wife, deportment should be quiet and still.

> Also, there are lewd (in naru) people.

## Literary English Translation

The nature of the human heart is such that one must recognize it.
The profound disposition of the heart, which must be hidden,
If this is exposed, it will be amplified and spread, like a song,
and the heart, which easily shifts its focus to outward things, must be strictly cautioned.
Things whose colors are visible and destined to decay exist throughout the world.
The human heart is like a flower fashioned from polished white silk—
If dyed, it takes on color, and when brought into the light of day,
It becomes manifest. There are various desires of the ear, mouth, and nose;
and they are not solely driven by the sexual lust (inyoku) that covets wealth (tomi).
The necessity of concealing one’s shame is likewise entirely a matter of desire.
One must deeply restrain oneself and be fearful concerning what is already sufficient.
Even abstinence (muyoku) is only true abstinence if it stems from a heart free of deep greed.
The song that teaches the virtue of knowing sufficiency:

To yield, and to let be.
The mountain well water
Which speaks to me.

○ The constant loyalty and fidelity (teichū) one should safeguard,
must recognize and bestow the sanctity due to the truly fearful heart.
In ancient times,
Caution was highly valued. It was understood as knowing the dangers of the abyss,
And continually approaching life as if treading on deep, thin ice.
It was said that if one succumbs to temptation, they will surely fail.
A wife serving her husband should be sheltered by him,
But even concerning matters she has not encountered by happenstance, and concerning
The necessary conduct and comportment (tachi-i) required to protect her own person,
Her demeanor must be like standing at the edge of the abyss and treading thin ice.
○ Naming you "Yo" is not
A name I chose. It is linked to the Mori clan,
and linked to the Mura clan; if it is kept secret,
it ought to be permissible.
This is womanly virtue. If she can truly devote herself to one man,
She fulfills the four essential practices.
It is not merely the virtue of a wife; her every movement must be quiet and composed.

> Furthermore, there are also lewd people.

## Structural & Editorial Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | **Moral Essay / Didactic Commentary.** This text utilizes dense, classical language and moral metaphors (abyss, thin ice, ancient wisdom) to establish a high standard of conduct, particularly for women. It functions as a philosophical preamble or an editorial response to a sensitive topic, typical of Japanese magazines using classical authority to frame modern transgressions. |
| **Author Attribution** | **Implicitly Editorial or Scholarly.** No explicit author name. The authoritative, prescriptive voice ("...know this," "...should be admonished," "...must be done") suggests an editorial writer or a contributing scholar setting the moral stage. |
| **Editorial Voice** | Highly formal, severe, and Confucian-influenced. The voice is concerned with the suppression of innate desire (慾) and the maintenance of external appearances (貞忠, 恥, 立居). |
| **Target Audience Signals**| Educated, literate readership interested in discussions of morality, desire, and social control. The classical language (歴史的仮名遣い, use of べし, allusion to ancient texts) signals intellectual seriousness, even when the subject matter (like *inyoku*—sexual lust) is sensational. |
| **Positioning** | Mid-magazine, likely following a story or a section dealing with sexual transgression or moral ambiguity, providing the "proper" scholarly context or conclusion. The page number (24) supports an internal position. |
| **Layout/Formatting** | Contains two marked paragraphs (○), suggesting distinct points or sources being cited/discussed. The small poem/verse at the end (譲るとしよし...) might be a specific classical citation or a concluding thought. The final, smaller line (*Also, there are lewd people*) acts as a harsh, summarizing counterpoint. |

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

| Concept | Explanation & Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Historical Orthography** | The use of *rekishiteki kanazukai* (historical kana usage, e.g., べし instead of べき, いしへ instead of いにしえ) lends an air of traditional authority and scholarly rigor. This was a common stylistic choice in serious or moralistic writing in the early Showa era, even in pulp magazines, to elevate the tone of potentially taboo content. |
| **“Treading Thin Ice” (淵にのぞみ氷をふむが如し)** | This is a direct reference to a famous metaphor (臨深履薄, *rinshin ribaku*) originating from the Chinese *Shijing* (Book of Odes). It emphasizes extreme caution in moral conduct, suggesting that one must treat every action as if standing on the edge of a precipice or walking on ice that might break. In this context, it is specifically applied to the stringent sexual and social behavior expected of women (妻の徳). |
| **Wife's Virtue (妻の徳)** | This refers to the traditional, highly restrictive Confucian and Japanese feudal expectations placed upon married women, emphasizing absolute loyalty (貞忠), obedience to the husband, silence (立居静にして), and the suppression of personal desire. This standard was highly emphasized in mid-20th century moral discourse, particularly as women gained slightly more freedom post-Meiji/Taisho. |
| **Desire (慾/淫慾)** | The text carefully differentiates between general desires of the senses (耳口鼻の欲) and sexual lust (*inyoku*). The essay argues that all attempts to conceal shame or acquire wealth stem from *yoku*. This framing attempts a Buddhist or philosophical justification for why these desires must be strictly controlled, thereby legitimizing the *discussion* of these desires. |
| **Mori/Mura Clan Names** | The reference to "Mori-shi" and "Mura-shi" related to the name "Yo" is highly obscure without context. It might be a deliberate, faux-scholarly genealogy intended to create a sense of historical complexity for a fictional character or anecdote, or a veiled reference to specific families known to the author/audience. |

## Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

| Term (Japanese) | Normalized Reading | Primary Meaning | Contextual/Ero-Guro Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 隠すべき心ばへ | Kakusubeki kokorobae | Heart disposition that must be concealed | Focuses on deep, innate (sexual) urges that must not be revealed to maintain social order. |
| 露〔アバ〕す | Abakasu | To expose, reveal, strip bare | Often used in ero-guro contexts to mean the revelation of hidden desires, shame, or secrets. |
| 色見えてつろふ | Iro miete tsurofu | Color is visible and decaying/fading | Refers to the transience of beauty, often used for women's beauty or moral integrity (i.e., virtue decay). |
| 淫慾 | Inyoku | Sexual lust, lewd desire | The central taboo subject, discussed here in a clinical/moralizing tone. |
| 貞忠 | Teichū | Loyalty, fidelity, chastity | The chief virtue expected of women/wives, encompassing sexual purity and emotional devotion. |
| 立居 | Tachi-i | Deportment, manner, bearing | Refers to one's conduct in everyday life; emphasizes quiet, restrained movement (静にして). |
| 恥 | Haji | Shame, disgrace | The social mechanism used to enforce moral standards; hiding *haji* is itself an expression of desire (the desire to preserve status). |

---

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

| Theme | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The Inevitability of Desire** | The essay asserts that desire (*yoku*) is the root of everything, not just wealth and lust, but even the act of hiding shame. By making desire universal, the text normalizes its existence while simultaneously demanding its complete suppression. |
| **Control vs. Exposure** | The dominant dynamic is the tension between the "deeply hidden heart" (ふかき心ばへ) and its inevitable exposure (露わす). The warning that exposure leads to amplification ("sung about and spread") suggests that the magazine itself participates in this cycle of revelation and sensationalism. |
| **The Fetishization of Purity** | The entire discussion of "Wife's Virtue" (妻の徳), "Treading Thin Ice," and the need for silent, composed conduct establishes an impossibly high standard of female purity. This purity, by being described as perpetually threatened and requiring extreme vigilance, becomes a fetishized object, typical of the era's focus on threatened female chastity. |
| **Moral Hypocrisy** | The editorial voice, while promoting severe moral restriction, is published within a genre (ero-guro) that thrives on the very desires and exposures it warns against. The text simultaneously functions as a moral prophylactic and a guide to the forbidden. |
