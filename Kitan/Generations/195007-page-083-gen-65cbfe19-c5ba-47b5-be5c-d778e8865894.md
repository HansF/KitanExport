## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

If you are a person with good memory, you probably know. That before the war loudly-talked-about doctorless villages, to lonely mountains-inside doctor-less villages, no matter how much the then-government loudly said [to go], because there were no takers, with a three-year mandatory service period, there was [a case of] recruiting medical vocational school scholarship students.
At that time, I who graduated middle school had no prospect of being sent to higher school, weeping-weeping applied to this exam, braving the intense competition of one in thirty-something people, entered as a supported student. By the time the four-year course was finished, already there was no need to depart for a clinic in a village deep in the mountains.
It was because the war was presenting a terrifying aspect of eat-or-be-eaten. As if waiting for graduation, I was immediately driven to the battlefield as a trainee military doctor. Those several years spent entirely in bloody battlefields, and then long internment life in the Soviet Union.
Because of having the special skill called "doctor," being retained until the very end, finally landing at Maizuru was an autumn when more than four years after the end of the war had already passed.
My own house in the Osaka suburbs that I finally reached was completely a burnt field, with only bush clover growing slightly among the rubble.
With a body exhausted by disappointment and fatigue, while walking the plaza in front of Osaka Station, my eyes stared intently at a three-line advertisement in the evening newspaper in my hand. "Invitation, Physician." Unintentionally I let out a cry of joy, "Ah!", and felt my heart suddenly beat violently.
A job! And moreover, as a doctor—
The place seeking labor was Ebisu Trading on Midosuji. Speaking of Ebisu Trading, in whiskey it is one of Osaka's leading large companies.
The next morning, with a somewhat embellished resume in my pocket, I visited the office of Ebisu Trading. The fact of not even owning a single suit made my heart feel base and I was attacked by limitless loneliness.
Restraining my racing heart and waiting in the reception room for a short while, a portly executive-type manager appeared while wearing a smile. While being surprised for a moment by my demobilized soldier's appearance, when he looked at the resume, cleverly:
"That is, that is, for a long time thank you for your hard work. It must have been quite difficult. Fortunately on our side suddenly one doctor became necessary, and while I thought of asking someone from Handai (Osaka University), thinking that if an unemployed person or an excellent person who was demobilized would come, I placed the newspaper advertisement..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

1.
Those with a sharp memory will likely recall the pre-war outcry over "doctorless villages." Since no one would volunteer for those lonely, remote mountain hamlets no matter how much the government pleaded, they began recruiting scholarship students for medical vocational schools on the condition of three years of mandatory service. 
Back then, having just graduated from middle school with no hope of further education, I tearfully applied for this program. I braved the fierce competition—with only one in thirty applicants accepted—and entered as a state-sponsored student. However, by the time I completed my four-year course, the need to depart for some remote mountain clinic had vanished.
The war had turned into a horrific "eat-or-be-eaten" struggle. Almost the moment I graduated, I was rushed to the front lines as a trainee medical officer. After years spent in the gore of the battlefield came a long period of internment in the Soviet Union. 
Because my medical skills were deemed essential, I was among the last to be repatriated. When I finally set foot in the port of Maizuru, it was already autumn, more than four full years since the war’s end.
I finally made my way back to my home in the Osaka suburbs, only to find a charred wasteland where bush clover sprouted sparingly amidst the rubble. 
Exhausted and hollowed out by despair, I was wandering through the plaza in front of Osaka Station when a three-line ad in the evening paper caught my eye: "Physician Wanted." I let out an involuntary cry of joy, my heart suddenly hammering against my ribs.
A job! And a medical one at that!
The employer was Ebisu Trading on Midosuji—a company famous in Osaka as a premier whiskey distributor.
The following morning, with a slightly embellished resume tucked into my pocket, I visited their office. The fact that I didn't even own a proper suit made me feel small and pathetic, and a profound sense of loneliness washed over me.
Trying to calm my racing heart, I waited in the reception room until a portly, executive-looking manager appeared with a smile. He seemed momentarily taken aback by my ragged demobilized soldier's appearance, but after glancing at my resume, he spoke with practiced tact:
"Well, well, thank you for your long years of service. It must have been incredibly difficult for you. As it happens, we suddenly found ourselves in need of a doctor. I had considered reaching out to Osaka University, but then I thought it might be better to run an ad in the paper, hoping to find someone currently unemployed—perhaps an excellent man recently demobilized..."

Exposing the Secret Underground Nightclub: A World of Decadent Excess
By Toshio Izu

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Layout and Structure
The text follows the traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading from top-to-bottom and right-to-left. 

*   **Header/Title:** The title is placed in the lower-right quadrant, using large, bold, stylized hand-drawn lettering. The phrase "Secret Nightclub" (秘密ナイトクラブ) is particularly emphasized with a rough, "pulp" style font.
*   **Columns:** The narrative text is arranged in several narrow vertical columns above the illustration. 
*   **Illustration:** A prominent line drawing occupies the bottom half of the page. It depicts a large, Western-style "executive" figure (the manager described in the text) holding a glass, with bottles of liquor (labeled "Ebisu") on the table. He wears glasses and a suit with a pocket square, contrasting sharply with the protagonist's described poverty. The style is reminiscent of 1940s-50s magazine illustrations—caricatured yet detailed.
*   **Page Number:** A small "-84-" is visible at the bottom right corner, indicating this is part of a larger publication.

### Typography
*   **Body Text:** Uses a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-20th-century printing. It includes *furigana* (reading aids) for some kanji, though they are sparse.
*   **Title:** Features heavy, high-contrast brush-stroke style characters for "酒池肉林" (Sake ponds and meat forests/Decadent excess) and "地下組織" (Underground organization), which were designed to grab the reader's attention on a crowded magazine page.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### Post-War Japan (c. 1949-1950)
The text mentions being repatriated to Maizuru four years after the war ended, placing the setting around 1949. This was the "Black Market" era, characterized by extreme poverty, food shortages, and a booming underground economy.

*   **Repatriation (Hikiage):** Millions of Japanese soldiers and civilians were stranded overseas after August 1945. Those in Soviet-controlled areas often faced years of forced labor (Siberian internment) before being allowed back. Maizuru was the primary port for these returnees.
*   **War Damage:** The protagonist returns to find Osaka a "burnt field" (*yakenohara*). Allied firebombing destroyed large swathes of Japanese cities.
*   **Medical Education:** In the 1930s-40s, "Medical Vocational Schools" (*Ika Senmon Gakko* or *I-sen*) were a faster track to becoming a doctor than Imperial Universities. The government subsidized students to address the shortage of doctors in rural areas (*mu-ichon*), a real social issue of the time.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This story likely comes from a "Kasutori" magazine—cheap, sensationalist publications that flourished during the Occupation. They often featured stories of crime, the "pan-pan" girls (prostitutes), and the decadence of the new wealthy class contrasted against the suffering of veterans.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **酒池肉林 (Shuchi Nikurin):** Literally "ponds of sake and forests of meat." An idiom originating from ancient Chinese history (King Zhou of Shang) referring to extreme luxury, debauchery, and carnal excess.
*   **無医村 (Mu-ichon):** A village with no resident doctor.
*   **給養託生 (Kyūyō Takusei):** A student whose education and living expenses are paid for by the state or an organization in exchange for future service.
*   **復員姿 (Fukuin-sugata):** The appearance of a demobilized soldier, typically wearing a worn-out military uniform because they had no civilian clothes to return to.
*   **三行広告 (Sangyō Kōkoku):** Literally "three-line advertisement." Small, cheap classified ads in newspapers.
*   **如才なく (Josai-naku):** Adroitly, tactfully, or smartly. Doing something without making a blunder or being rude.
*   **潤色 (Junshoku):** Literally "coloring" or "embellishing." Here it means exaggerating one's resume to look better.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Fallen Professional:** A common trope in post-war literature is the educated man (a doctor, lawyer, or teacher) reduced to rags and desperation. It reflects the total collapse of the pre-war social order.
*   **Decadence vs. Poverty:** The contrast between the protagonist's "burnt field" home and the "Ebisu Trading" whiskey tycoon highlights the widening gap between the war-impoverished masses and the "New Yen" millionaires who profited from the black market or luxury trades.
*   **The "Shadow" World:** The title promises an "exposure" of a "secret underground nightclub." This appeals to the voyeuristic curiosity of the post-war public, interested in the hidden lives of the corrupt elite.
*   **Suspicion and Hope:** The manager’s excessive politeness and the "too good to be true" nature of the job offer (hiring a ragged veteran over a university graduate) create a sense of foreboding and noir-like tension.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Fiction, Short Story (likely serialized).
*   **Genre:** Noir, Social Realism, Exposé.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Poverty, Veterans, Decadence, Medical, Mystery, Black Market.
