As expected, a feeling of embarrassment arose, so enduring wanting to look, while looking out the window, again a quiet departing footstep sound occurred.
Thinking "he will come again soon," paying attention only to that sign of coming, while again doing a tanuki-sleep (faking sleep), before I knew it I fell asleep, and then not much later the night dawned. Because it was a south-facing room, the shining morning sun came inserting in.
When the time for the lecture meeting drew near, with my heavy head as it was, I finished the lecture, and then, at the night's alumni gathering when I spoke of this, "You are quite a Sukesan (helper/lucky fellow), aren't you?" I was teased. According to what the alumni said, that region provides two types of pillows for honored guests, and it seems they leave it to their selection.
I, who am twice as sensitive to love affairs as a normal person, saw a monk's head and a bright red wooden pillow lined up, and just by jumping to the conclusion that a sleeping-together beauty was coming and being happy, I still think it is an inn that does sinful things.

Man Who Rejoices in the Happiness of Others
—Perverted Thief—
By Fumikawa Oriichi

If it comes to saying "just borrowing a little" a stranger's things without permission, this is a fine Mr. Thief, but recently "kiss thieves" and such perverted types occasionally appear. Saying "Hearing the sound and thinking of the form is the human norm," or something like that, this is vulgarly called "nui-××" (penetrating ××). When this gradually worsens and becomes a so-called peeping tom, it's already an undeniable sexual pervert.

There is a charming fellow whose illness of this hobby entered his "kōkō" (deepest vitals) and became a strange thief. Akagi Kitaro (38), who is a traveling medicine salesman in a certain town in Ibaraki Prefecture, is the one.
This man was arrested as a thief specializing in iron kettles, but the fact that he went around stealing only about 50 or 60 of these old iron kettles and didn't lay a hand on any other money or goods is where the interesting part of this thief lies.
According to his confession, during the day while selling medicine, if he found a house with glass doors or especially a house where a young couple lived, he would mark it to sneak into that house, and taking advantage of the night, come again to that house, stand under the eaves, put his ear to the back door, wander all around, and peep at the appearance of the man and woman inside the house, watching until the two of them were intimately ××××.
Eventually, by observing this state as detailedly as possible to satisfy himself, he finally came to break into the house, and furthermore, he made it a rule to steal an iron kettle and go home as a souvenir of having achieved that objective.
Even after returning home, every time he saw that iron kettle, the night life of the young couple in the house he stole it from was remembered, and it invited him again into a realm of dreams and illusions.
In this regard, while he is a thief, shouldn't he be called a formidable artist? He is an example of a rare thief, a man who rejoices in the happiness of others.

Pink Schoolgirl Conduct Record
Shoplifting in the Nude

1. The Violated Virgin

In the May sky, which looked like it had been swept by a light blue brush, white clouds are flowing gently.
Miyo was overturned, bathing in the dazzling sunlight, on the slope of the Kanzaki River embankment where sprouts of green grass had budded all over.
The warmth of the earth and the smell of lush grass tickled Miyo's back and armpits intensely. Miyo stretched her limbs with all her might and immersed herself in a feeling of happiness like a high tide.
The train she finally boarded after watching two or three full ones pass—it was not boarded by her own will, but by chance the entrance of the train came in front of where she was standing, and the crowd behind her forced her in. Even if she wanted to get off, she couldn't. Even if she didn't want to get off, she would be pushed out. It was boarding and alighting from a train where she could do nothing with her own will. Immediately she was crushed like a cracker, her bag flew, and her buttons were torn off. Having encountered such an experience, Miyo was beginning to thoroughly dislike commuting these days.
The ×× Girls' Academy where Miyo commutes was superior in its scenic educational environment and boasted a liberal tradition, but that was only at the time when she passed the high-competition selection exam and entered; now, such things were no longer an attraction or a pride. Classes were like discussion groups or entertainment parties, and at the thin views on love and confessions of married life by the teachers, she was (getting tired of it...)

**[Top Section: The Inn Incident]**
Naturally, a sense of shame welled up in me. I resisted the urge to look and stared out the window instead; eventually, I heard the sound of footsteps quietly retreating. 
Thinking the visitor might return, I stayed alert, but while feigning sleep, I drifted off. Before long, dawn broke. Since the room faced south, it was flooded with the brilliant morning sun. 
As the time for my lecture approached, I pushed through with a heavy head and finished the talk. Later that night, at a gathering of alumni, I told the story. They teased me, saying, "You certainly got lucky, didn't you?" According to my former classmates, the local custom at that inn was to provide two types of pillows for distinguished guests and let them choose.
Being twice as sensitive to romantic affairs as the average person, I had seen a "monk’s head" (plain) pillow and a vibrant red wooden pillow side-by-side and immediately jumped to the conclusion that a beautiful companion was coming to share my bed. I still think it was a cruel trick for a regular inn to play.

**[Middle Article: The Voyeur Thief]**
**The Man Who Relished Others' Bliss: The Perverted Thief**
*By Fumikawa Oriichi*

While anyone who takes someone else's property without asking is a common thief, lately we see the emergence of "perverted" types, such as the so-called "kiss thieves." As the saying goes, "to hear the sound and imagine the form is human nature," and in the streets, this is known as "penetrating ××." When this obsession festers, one becomes a "peeping tom"—an undeniable sexual deviant.

There was a peculiar fellow whose obsession became so deep-seated it bordered on the pathological. This was Akagi Kitaro (38), a traveling medicine salesman from a town in Ibaraki Prefecture.
He was eventually arrested as a specialist in stealing iron kettles. What makes his case "interesting" is that he stole some 50 or 60 old kettles but never touched money or other valuables.
According to his confession, while making his rounds during the day, he would scout for houses with glass doors—specifically those occupied by young couples. He would mark them for a nighttime visit. Under the cover of darkness, he would return, lurking under the eaves or pressing his ear to the back door. He would circle the house, peeping inside until he witnessed the couple in the middle of ××××.
Eventually, to further satisfy his voyeuristic urges, he began breaking into the houses to observe the scenes in greater detail. He made it a habit to steal an iron kettle as a "souvenir" of his success.
Back at home, every time he looked at those kettles, the memories of the couples' private nighttime lives would come flooding back, luring him once again into a world of erotic fantasy.
In this sense, though a criminal, one might almost call him a formidable "artist" of sorts. He remains a rare example of a thief who truly rejoiced in the happiness of others.

**TRUE STORY NOVEL: Memoirs of a "Pink" Schoolgirl**
**Shoplifting in the Nude**

*Chapter 1: The Violated Virgin*

In the May sky, which looked as though it had been swept by a light-blue brush, white clouds drifted lazily.
Miyo lay on her back on the slope of the Kanzaki River embankment, where fresh green shoots were sprouting everywhere, bathing in the dazzling sunlight. The warmth of the earth and the scent of lush grass tickled her back and armpits with a sultry heat. Stretching her limbs as far as they would go, she allowed herself to sink into a wave of bliss as deep as a high tide.
Thinking of her commute, she recalled finally forcing her way onto a train after watching several others pass, packed to the brim. It hadn't even been her choice; she simply happened to be standing by the door when the surging crowd behind her shoved her inside. Once in, she couldn't get off even if she wanted to; nor could she stay on if the crowd pushed her out. Commuting was a process entirely removed from her own will. She would be flattened like a cracker, her bag would go flying, and her buttons would be torn off. These days, the very thought of the journey to school made her heart sink with loathing.
The ×× Girls' Academy Miyo attended boasted a beautiful campus and a proud "liberal" tradition. However, that prestige had only mattered back when she was fighting to pass the competitive entrance exams. Now, it held no charm or pride for her. Classes had devolved into mere gossip circles or social hours, where teachers offered shallow views on love or shared tedious details of their own marriages, leaving her feeling...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** This is a classic example of a mid-century Japanese magazine layout. It uses vertical text (**tategaki**) arranged in multiple columns. The use of different font sizes creates a clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Sensationalism:** The headlines use bold, thick fonts (**Kanteiryū** style influences) to grab attention. Phrases like "Perverted Thief" and "Pink Schoolgirl" are designed to entice readers of pulp fiction.
*   **Censorship:** The use of "××" or "××××" (referred to as *fuseji*) is ubiquitous. This was a common tactic to bypass obscenity laws while still communicating sexually explicit content to the reader's imagination.
*   **Illustrations:** Small, sketchy line drawings of women in various states of undress (swimsuits/lingerie) serve as "eye candy" to break up the dense text blocks.
*   **Column Structure:** The page is divided into three distinct content areas: a continuation of a lead story/essay, a featured report on a "weird" crime, and the start of a "true story" erotic novel.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Magazines:** Named after a cheap, foul-smelling shochu made from sake lees, "Kasutori" magazines were short-lived, low-quality publications that flooded the market in post-WWII Japan. They focused on "Three S" themes: Sex, Screen, and Sport, catering to a populace seeking escapism from the hardships of the occupation era.
*   **Pink Schoolgirls (Momo-iro Jogakusei):** The term "pink" in Japanese often denotes eroticism. Stories about "delinquent" or sexually active schoolgirls were a staple of the era, reflecting a societal anxiety/obsession with the changing morals of the younger generation under Western (American) influence.
*   **Post-War Commuting:** The description of being crushed in trains "like a cracker" reflects the extreme overcrowding of Japanese public transit in the rebuilding years, a trope that continues in Japanese media today.
*   **Medicine Salesmen (Kusuri-uri):** The "perverted thief" is identified as a traveling medicine salesman. Historically, these salesmen traveled from village to village, and because they entered private homes, they were often the subject of urban legends or suspicious gossip.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **変態 (Hentai):** In this era, it meant "abnormality" or "perversion" in a more clinical/sensationalist sense, before it became a global loanword for anime pornography.
*   **狸寝入り (Tanuki-neiri):** Literally "raccoon dog sleep." It refers to feigning sleep to observe something or avoid a situation.
*   **膏もうに入って (Kōkō ni haitte):** A phrase from the Chinese classics meaning a disease has reached the "vitals" (the space between the heart and diaphragm), making it incurable. Here, it means his obsession has become a permanent part of his character.
*   **桃色 (Momoiro):** "Peach color" or "Pink." Historically associated with eroticism or scandalous behavior (e.g., "Pink movies").
*   **行状記 (Gyōjōki):** A "record of conduct" or "memoir." Often used in titles for stories detailing the scandalous or notable lives of certain groups.
*   **草いきれ (Kusa-ikire):** The hot, humid smell of lush grass on a summer day.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and Consumption:** Both the thief article and the schoolgirl story revolve around peeping and the consumption of the "private lives" of others. The thief steals "souvenirs" to relive his voyeuristic high, mirroring the reader's act of reading this sensationalist magazine.
*   **Loss of Innocence:** The title "The Violated Virgin" contrasted with the idyllic descriptions of May and the girl's initial academic pride suggests a narrative of corruption—a common theme in "True Story" pulp fiction where innocence is lost to the harsh realities of the city or "modern" life.
*   **Anti-Intellectualism:** The critique of the "liberal" school and its "shallow" teachers suggests a cynical view of postwar educational reforms, portraying them as lacking substance and being preoccupied with trivial romantic talk.
