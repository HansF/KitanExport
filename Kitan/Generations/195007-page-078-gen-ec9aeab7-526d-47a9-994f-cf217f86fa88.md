美しい肌をした混血児の少女
喰う
何ぜ

肺病の癖に新開地のパン助ばかり買うている麻雀好きな男何れも大分変ったメンバーでした。
混血児の彼女は十六です。チューリップのように真っ赤な唇、悩ましそうに張り切った乳房、黒耀石の瞳、女王峰のように膨らんだ尻、腹から脛へかけてのなだらかな線。
人の忌み嫌うセムシということを心臓から置き忘れた私は、コーヒ茶碗を百もブチ割るような素晴らしい恋をしかけました。
生命の一ツや二ツ、エイ捨てゝしまいませうよ。名前ですか、海邊から来た女、オットこれはバリエテでしたネ、波子と言います。

四、失戀
元気のない犬が長い舌をぺロリと出す夏の日の黄昏でした。私は例のゴミの溜った三角形の窓から芭蕉を見ていました。
波子はその時、お客に喰わせるトマトサラダを作っていました。愛欲の炎が地獄の火のように灸々と燃え、唇はドス黒く歪み、目はカメレオンのように変な色がさして来ました。私がいつも愛欲 躍り狂う時の悪い癖です。
私はミシ～と音のする危い階段を傳い波子の傍へ蝙蝠のようにコッソリと忍び寄りました。丁度運よく脂肪過多症の彼女の父は留守でした。
「波さん、波子さん」
私は出合頭に彼女の妖艶な目で睨みすえられました。
「何んですつて、此の醜いセムシさん、何んの用で来たの、お馬鹿さん悪魔の奥さんでも貰いなさいよ」
「……私は貴女を心のドン底から愛しているんです 不具者の戀は」凄まじい

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[I am a Dancer]**
"Yes, even I, though looking like this, have a proper husband, and as for children, there are even two. Did you get disappointed? ... You say the dancer trade must be painful? Don't say such jokes; if I can do the dance I like all day, hear pleasant music, talk nonsense with men and laugh 'hera-hera,' it becomes 'onmani' (money/livelihood), excuse me. You have quite bad blood circulation (you are slow-witted). ... My age? I'll say it clearly; don't be surprised. For this year, thirty-seven—that’s a lie, but two before forty (38) is the authentic truth, worthless. If you think it's a lie, shall I snatch off my wig and show you a bald head?
It's creepy so stop? OK! Since it’s come to this, I'll confess everything. Even these pure white beautiful teeth, when sleeping at night, I pop them out and put them in a cup of water by the pillow. Even so, you say there’s no unpleasantness? Are you wearing a glass eye? On this cheek, a sophisticated plaster (prosthetic/filler) in which I invested the large sum of 30,000 gold (yen) is pasted. If you think it's a lie, try touching it. It might make a 'kochin-kochin' hard sound. One eye is a glass eye, too. Truly sorry about that. But you see, on top of that I love playing with fire, so I suppose I'm a woman you can talk to. ...
Dance with me next time too. If you think you're dancing with your mother, won't you feel at ease? ... La, la, la..."
...Such ridiculous lies she told, and with this, there was an eighteen-year-old dancer catching customers in this hall. So this is what they call "propaganda" (publicity). Since I am an ordinary woman, I can't use such tactics. I just honestly partner and dance. Somehow, though, even if not like what was just told, knowing the art of catching people is an advantage.
For someone like me, even if I knew it, I couldn't do it. ... I'm lonely, it's boring! ... Oh, it's already over. Dance with me until the next turn...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**I’m a Dancer**
"Oh, sure, even a girl like me has a respectable husband and a couple of kids. What, disappointed? You think the dancing life is a hard grind? Don't make me laugh! I get to dance all day to great music, talk trash with the guys, and as long as I keep a silly grin on my face, the money just rolls in. Sorry about that! You're a bit slow on the uptake, aren't you? My age? I'll give it to you straight—don't faint now. I'm thirty-seven... just kidding. I'm thirty-eight, and that’s the honest, worthless truth. If you think I’m lying, you want me to yank off this wig and show you my bald head?
Too creepy? Fine, fine! If we're going there, I’ll tell you everything. These pearly white teeth? Every night before bed, I pop 'em right out and drop 'em in a glass of water. And you still think I’m charming? What, do you have a glass eye or something? This cheek of mine cost me thirty thousand yen in fancy plastic surgery—give it a poke if you don't believe me; it'll probably go 'clink.' One of my eyes is glass, too. Terribly sorry! But hey, I’ve still got a taste for 'playing with fire,' so I guess I’m still worth your time.
Dance with me again, okay? Just pretend you're dancing with your mother—doesn't that make you feel safe? La, la, la..."
Can you believe it? There was an eighteen-year-old dancer in this hall telling those ridiculous lies just to hook customers. I guess that’s what they call "marketing." I’m just an ordinary girl, so I can't pull off stunts like that. I just dance and keep it honest. Still, I suppose it’s useful to know how to reel 'em in, even if it's not through lies like those.
But a girl like me couldn't do it, even if I knew how. ... God, I’m lonely. This is so dull! ... Oh, is the song over already? Come on, dance with me until the next set starts.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into two distinct sections. The top story, "Atashi ya Dansaa," takes up the upper two-thirds. The bottom story is a separate piece of fiction or a column.
*   **Typography:** The titles use large, bold, hand-drawn or stylized fonts. The main body text is set in traditional vertical columns (*tategaki*).
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing accompanies the top story, showing a young woman (the 18-year-old dancer mentioned in the subtext) being observed by a man with glasses. The man's expression is one of curiosity or bewilderment, reflecting the customer's reaction to her "tactics."
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the first story is large and centered. The second story uses very large, heavy kanji ("喰う" and "何ぜ") to create a sense of visual impact or shock, typical of pulp magazines of the era.
*   **Punctuation:** Uses older styles of brackets and quotation marks `(( 々 「...`. The use of "..." (ellipses) and "~~~" (wave dashes) adds a colloquial, breathy quality to the dancer's monologue.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Dance Halls:** In the late 1940s and 50s, dance halls were popular social hubs in Japan. "Taxi dancers" or "hall girls" were women paid to dance with male customers. It was often a gateway to or a thin veil for sex work.
*   **The "Kasutori" Era:** This term refers to the cheap, low-quality magazines published during the occupation. They were named after "Kasutori" shochu, a harsh liquor said to cause a hangover after three cups, just as these magazines were expected to fold after three issues. They focused on "ero-guro-nansensu" (eroticism, grotesqueness, and nonsense).
*   **Monologue Style:** The dancer’s speech is written in a rough, "low-city" (*shitamachi*) feminine dialect. It is cynical and performative, reflecting the hard-boiled reality of women working in the entertainment districts (*shinkanchi*).
*   **Discrimination and "Ero-Guro":** The bottom story mentions a "mixed-race girl" (*konketsuji*) and a "hunchback" (*semushi*). In post-war Japan, mixed-race children (often the result of relationships between Japanese women and US soldiers) were marginalized. The use of "semushi" (a term now considered a slur) as a protagonist highlights the era's fascination with physical deformity as a literary trope for social outcasts.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **レツキとした (Rekki to shita):** Modern: れっきとした. Means "respectable," "proper," or "undeniable."
*   **オンマニ (Onmani):** This is slang for "money" or "profit." It likely derives from "money" or is a corruption of "om mani padme hum" (suggesting a blessing/luck), but in the context of sex work/entertainment of the era, it specifically meant "making a living."
*   **カヅラ (Kazura):** Modern: かつら (Katsura). A wig.
*   **正眞正銘 (Shoushin-shoumei):** Genuine; the real deal.
*   **パン助 (Pansuke):** A derogatory slang term for a "Pan-pan girl" (a prostitute catering to occupation soldiers).
*   **セムシ (Semushi):** A hunchback/kyphosis. It was a common trope in dark "mystery" or "grotesque" fiction of the time.
*   **バリエテ (Variete):** From the French "variété," referring to a variety show or vaudeville.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Deception as Survival:** The young dancer lies about being an old woman with false teeth and a glass eye. This "tactical" self-deprecation is a defense mechanism and a way to entertain customers by being "interesting" or "outrageous." The narrator envies this ability to "hook" people.
*   **Cynicism and Loneliness:** Despite the lively atmosphere of the dance hall, the underlying tone is one of profound loneliness ("I'm lonely, it's boring!"). The gaiety is a thin mask for post-war exhaustion.
*   **The Grotesque Body:** The bottom story focuses on physical descriptions—the "lush" body of the 16-year-old girl and the "deformed" body of the narrator. This reflects a post-war obsession with the carnal and the "ugly" truths of human existence.
*   **Class and Status:** The mention of "30,000 yen" for surgery was a massive sum at the time, indicating the extremes these women would theoretically go to (or lie about) to maintain their appearance or "brand."
