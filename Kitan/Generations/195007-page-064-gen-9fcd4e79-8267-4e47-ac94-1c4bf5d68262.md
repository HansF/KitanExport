## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Ro-san, but still strange, isn't it. 'Boy' (Bouya) is better, looking from Big Sister's [my] view, you are a boy, ho-ho..."
Toyoko, thinking she said so, plump both arms around Yoshitarō's neck wrapped, tightly embraced, and rubbed cheeks.
Choking-like woman's body odor, soft skin.
Yoshitarō, not understanding why excitement, and anxiety and fear felt, rattle-rattle body trembled.
"Oh, Boy, boy with hair parted, you are trembling, aren't you. Is it cold? Or is it happy?"
While staring fixedly into Yoshitarō's face, she said.
Yoshitarō, lips tremblingly shaking, things to say even could not do.
"Boy is truly naive (ubu), isn't he. Big Sister, people like Boy, loves very much."
And stronger than before tightly, with full strength embraced.
"How is it, have you become warm?"
To Yoshitarō, the words Toyoko said even were not heard. And, younger sister's matter or anyone's matter, from his mind had vanished away.
Eventually, Toyoko the arms she was holding slowly released.
Yoshitarō, with a start returning to himself, widely eyes opened and embarrassedly, softly toward Toyoko looked.
Toyoko, with a grin laughed.
From opened Toyoko's chest, perkily face showing breasts, without mercy Yoshitarō's eyes shot.
Not yet woman contacted Yoshitarō's skin, white and clean and was beautiful.
Toyoko's eyes, mysteriously burning, as if eating into him fixedly Yoshitarō looked down upon.
Through Toyoko's throat, with a 'gokun' sound, raw saliva passed through.
Lascivious-looking faint smile, faintly to the woman's lips rose.
Eerie silence continued.
However, that was the silence before the storm.
Flower vase flower one, with a 'potori' fell and on the floor rolled, petals scattered.

(Section) 3

"Oh, Boy has no backbone, doesn't he. It is no good, isn't it. Pull yourself together."
Toyoko, when she bit a cigarette, with skillful hand-movement a lighter lit.
Purple smoke 'pou' rose.
"Boy, from now I will treat you to a feast, won't I."
Toyoko, hand extending on the table receiver grabbed.
"It's okay. I, already go home."
Yoshitarō, suddenly 'muku-muku' [sturdily/slowly] rose up.
"Isn't it fine. If you stay slowly. Staying overnight is fine too. Hey, something delicious food let's eat."
"Because sister is waiting, I'm going home."
"So, really you go home? Then it can't be helped. Then, tomorrow night again please come. Big Sister, here will be waiting."
Yoshitarō, without even answering stood up, and unsteadily toward the door walked.
"Wait a moment."
Toyoko, from inside handbag five or six sheets of 100-yen bills grabbing out, forcibly into Yoshitarō's hand made him clutch.
"Tomorrow surely please come. Feasts arranging I'll be waiting."
Yoshitarō, like escaping, to the outside went.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Ro-san, it’s still so strange, isn't it? From where I stand, 'Little Boy' suits you much better. You really are just a boy, aren't you? Ho-ho..."
The moment the words left Toyoko’s lips, she wrapped her plump arms around Yoshitarō’s neck, pulling him into a crushing embrace and rubbing her cheek against his. The stifling scent of her body and the softness of her skin overwhelmed him. Yoshitarō, gripped by a confusing mixture of arousal, anxiety, and sheer terror, began to tremble uncontrollably.

"Oh, look at you, my little boy with the parted hair—you’re shaking. Are you cold? Or is it pleasure?" she teased, staring intently into his eyes. Yoshitarō’s lips quivered, but he found himself unable to utter a single word.

"You really are so innocent. I just love boys like you," she whispered, squeezing him even tighter than before. "There now, are you getting warmer?"

Yoshitarō didn’t even hear her words. His younger sister, and everyone else he knew, had completely vanished from his mind. Eventually, Toyoko slowly released her hold. Startled back to reality, Yoshitarō opened his eyes wide and cast a bashful glance toward her.

Toyoko gave a knowing grin. Her kimono had fallen open, and her breasts, peeking out unashamedly, struck Yoshitarō's gaze with merciless intensity. Yoshitarō, who had never known a woman, had skin that was white, clean, and beautiful. Toyoko’s eyes burned with a mysterious fire as she stared him down hungrily. She swallowed hard, an audible gulp echoing in the silence. A faint, lewd smile played across her lips.

An eerie silence followed—the proverbial calm before the storm. A single flower dropped from its vase, tumbling onto the floor and scattering its petals.

III

"Oh, you really have no spine, do you? That won't do at all. Pull yourself together."
Toyoko put a cigarette to her lips and flicked a lighter with practiced ease. A plume of purple smoke drifted upward.
"Listen, I’m going to treat you to a wonderful feast now." Toyoko reached out and grabbed the telephone receiver on the table.
"No, it's okay. I'm going home now," Yoshitarō said, suddenly pushing himself up.
"Oh, don't be like that. Why don't you relax? You could even stay the night. Come on, let's have something delicious to eat."
"My sister is waiting for me. I have to go."
"I see. You're really leaving? Well, I suppose it can't be helped. In that case, come back tomorrow night. I'll be waiting for you right here."

Without a word of reply, Yoshitarō stood up and staggered toward the door.
"Wait a second!"
Toyoko pulled five or six hundred-yen bills from her handbag and forced them into Yoshitarō’s hand.
"You must come tomorrow. I’ll have a whole spread of food waiting for you."
Yoshitarō fled from the room as if he were escaping for his life.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page features a classic vertical layout divided into two main columns of text, with a large, evocative illustration occupying the top center and right. 
*   **Typography:** The text uses a standard Mincho typeface typical of mid-century printing. It employs "big tsu" (つ) instead of the modern small "tsu" (っ) in many places (e.g., 言つた), which was common in mechanical typesetting of that era before small kana became the universal standard in the late 1940s.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration serves as the primary "hook." It depicts a woman in a floral kimono from behind/side, embracing a younger man. The woman's posture suggests dominance, while the man's closed eyes suggest a state of overwhelmed submission.
*   **Structure:** The text includes a section break marked with "三" (Three), indicating the progression of the narrative.
*   **Graphic Elements:** The illustration is done in a line-art style with some stippling for texture, common in "low-brow" literary magazines of the period.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Kasutori Era (1945–1955):** This text perfectly exemplifies the *Kasutori* culture—a period in post-war Japan defined by cheap, mass-produced pulp magazines. They were often "ero-guro-nansensu" (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) and served as escapism for a population recovering from the trauma of war.
*   **Onee-san/Bouya Dynamic:** The "older woman/younger man" trope here plays on the "Maternal-Erotic" figure. Toyoko refers to herself as "Onee-san" (Big Sister), a common way for older women in the nightlife or "customs" industry to address themselves to younger clients, blending a sense of care with seduction.
*   **Post-war Economy:** Toyoko gives him "five or six hundred-yen bills." In the late 1940s, 100 yen was a significant amount of money (a starting salary for a teacher might be around 2,000–3,000 yen). Giving him this much money suggests she is either wealthy or a successful "pan-pan" girl (streetwalker) or geisha/hostess, and it highlights the power imbalance.
*   **The "Ubu" Man:** The protagonist, Yoshitarō, is described as "ubu" (naive/innocent). This archetype of the "fragile, beautiful young man" being corrupted or led by a worldly woman was a popular theme in post-war literature (e.g., works by Tanizaki or Dazai).

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **坊や (Bouya):** Usually "boy" or "baby." Used here as a diminutive, emasculating nickname to establish Toyoko's dominance.
*   **ウブ (Ubu):** Naive, green, virgin, or innocent. It carries a connotation of being uninitiated in the ways of the world (and sex).
*   **頸 (Kubi/Uji):** An older kanji for neck, often used in literature to describe the nape of the neck, which is considered highly erotic in Japanese culture.
*   **意気地がない (Ikiji ga nai):** Spineless, cowardly, or lacking "guts."
*   **御馳走 (Gochisou):** A feast or a treat. In this context, it carries a double meaning of both actual food and sexual "treats."
*   **百円札 (Hyaku-en satsu):** 100-yen notes. These were the high-denomination currency of the immediate post-war period.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Seduction and Predation:** The text uses predatory metaphors ("eyes shot," "burning mysteriously," "without mercy"). Toyoko is the hunter; Yoshitarō is the prey.
*   **The Physicality of Desire:** The text focuses heavily on sensory details: the "stifling" smell of a woman, the sound of swallowing spit (*gokun*), the "purple smoke" of the cigarette. These are hallmarks of *fūzoku shousetsu* (customs fiction).
*   **Guilt vs. Pleasure:** Yoshitarō’s sister being forgotten is a classic trope showing how carnal desire overrides social and familial duty.
*   **The "New Woman" vs. The "Old Morality":** Toyoko represents the liberated (and perhaps dangerous) post-war woman who smokes, uses a telephone (a luxury), and has her own money, while Yoshitarō represents the traditional, moralizing past that is "escaping" but also "unsteadily" drawn back.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Fiction (*Kasutori*).
*   **Genre:** Ero-guro, Romance (Dark/Obsessive), *Fūzoku* (Customs).
*   **Themes:** Seduction, Gender Roles, Post-war Japan, Innocence vs. Experience, Financial Power.
*   **Classification:** Mature (suggestive themes and descriptions).
