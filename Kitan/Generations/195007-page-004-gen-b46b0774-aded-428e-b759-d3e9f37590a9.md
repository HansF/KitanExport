## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Beyond this wall,
it is said a wonderful world exists.
Really, I wonder?
"Gate of Heaven" →

The town of the separation of the three trades.
Waiting houses and coffee shops
are side-by-side in harmony.

Oh my!
No way!
Such a
huge sign!!

This road,
if Reiko walks,
salt will be sprinkled [on her].

I wonder if I
should also become a hostess?

---

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"They say there's a wonderful world on the other side of this wall. Is that really true, I wonder?"
(Pointing to an entrance): "The Gate of Heaven."

"A district where the 'three trades' are clearly defined. Here, 'waiting houses' and cafes stand side-by-side in perfect harmony."

"Oh my! No way! Look at that massive sign!!"

"If a girl like Reiko were to walk down this street, they'd probably throw salt after her to purify the place!"

"I wonder... should I try becoming a hostess, too?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Composition:** The page uses a dynamic collage style typical of post-war Japanese magazines. It blends "candid" photography of urban life with hand-drawn illustrations and expressive typography. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The reader's eye is led from the top left entrance ("The Gate of Heaven") down into the heart of the district, then to the right where a modern young woman provides a reaction.
*   **Typography:** Captions are handwritten, giving a personal, diary-like or conversational feel. The signs within the photos (like "Waitresses Wanted") provide a stark, realistic contrast to the playful commentary.
*   **Imagery:** The photos capture a specific architectural style of the era—narrow alleys, wooden structures mixed with modernizing facades, and prominent signage for entertainment businesses.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** This is the "Akasen" (Red-line) era before the 1958 Prostitution Prevention Law. These districts were semi-legalized areas for sex work, often disguised as "waiting houses" (*machiai*) or "cafes" (*kissa/café*).
*   **三業 (Sangyo - Three Trades):** Historically refers to the three businesses allowed in licensed quarters: geisha houses (*okiya*), restaurants (*ryōtei*), and waiting houses (*machiai*). The text notes they are "separate," implying a specific administrative or zoning status.
*   **衛生サック (Eisei Sakku):** Meaning "Hygiene Sack," this was the common mid-century term for a condom. The girl's shock at the "big sign" refers to an advertisement for condoms, which would have been scandalous for a "proper" young lady to see so prominently displayed.
*   **Sprinkling Salt (塩をまかれる):** A traditional Japanese ritual to purify a space or ward off bad luck/impurity after an unwanted person leaves. The text suggests that the "pure" character Reiko is so out of place in this "dirty" district that the locals would feel the need to purify the street after her—or conversely, she is so upper-class that her presence is an affront.
*   **接客婦 (Sekkyakufu):** Literally "hostess" or "service woman." In this context, it was the standard job title for women working in these districts.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ゐます (Imasu):** An archaic spelling (pre-1946 orthography reform) of います. Its presence suggests the transition period of Japanese writing or a slightly older stylistic choice.
*   **知ら (Shira):** A contraction of *kashira*, used by women to express a question or doubt ("I wonder").
*   **待合 (Machiai):** A "waiting house" where patrons would meet companions; in this era, it was often a euphemism for a place of assignation.
*   **天国の門 (Tengoku no Mon):** "Gate of Heaven." This is used ironically or cynically to describe the entrance to a district of earthly pleasures.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "New Woman" vs. The Underworld:** Reiko represents the "modern girl" (*moga*) or a respectable young woman of the post-war era. Her presence in the district serves as a bridge for the reader, providing a sense of voyeuristic exploration through "innocent" eyes.
*   **Economic Reality:** The final line ("Should I become a hostess too?") reflects the economic hardships of post-war Japan, where "respectable" girls often considered or were forced into the entertainment industry for survival, though here it is phrased with a touch of naive playfulness.
*   **Urban Contrast:** The text highlights the "harmony" between different types of entertainment businesses, contrasting the chaotic post-war reality with an organized "world" behind the wall.
