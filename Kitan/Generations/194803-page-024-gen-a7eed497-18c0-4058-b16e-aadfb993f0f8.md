男が女に手篭めにされたと言う話
忍頂寺 穰
南陽二・画

「女工哀史」と言う言葉は今の若い人は知らないかも知れないが、日本の紡績業が全盛をうたわれていた時代には、やかましく言われたものであつた。
　その頃は今と正反対に農村が疲弊のドン底に喘いでいた時代だつたので貧農の娘たちは、年頃になると出稼ぎのため都會の織布工場へ出て来るのであつた。
　その當時はこの織娘を募集するために周旋人が、地方へのりこんで、前借金とか支度金とかの名目で僅か二、三十圓の金を餌に娘たちをかり集めに行ったものであつた。
　彼女達の日給と言うのも今から思えばお話にならない三十銭とか四十銭とゆう哀れなものであった。
　その頃、私は或る官廳の下ッ端役人をして、方々を出張して歩いていたので、梅雨も明けてそろそろ暑くなろうとゆう頃、東海道線に沿つた相當大きな驛の前の旅館に、一週間ばかり滞在の豫定で泊つた。
　夕食を済ますと、私は例の通り軽い服装でブラ／＼と散歩に出た。
街の中を、水の豊富で清澄な川が流れていて、そこに架つている橋なんかも中々趣のある街であつた。
　一時間ばかり歩き廻つて咽喉がかわいたので、とある場末の飲食店へ入つて、最近賣り始めたばかりの氷を注文した。
　するとそこへ若い職人風の男が三四人入つてきて、ラムネとか氷水を注文して、大きな聲で話し出した。
　その話が餘り面白いので聞くともなしに聞いていたが、大体に纏ぎ合わすと次のようである。
　この町から北へ寄つた郊外に、この沿線でも有数の大きな紡績工場がある。そこに働いている織姫は二千人を越えているが、その全部が地方農村から出稼ぎに来ているので、揃つて寄宿舎に収容されている。
　時々粗食と激働に堪えかねて逃亡しようとする娘があるが、そこはちやんと、要所／＼に見張人が配置されてあつて手ぬかりなく不心得者は連れ帰らされる。
　花の盛りの年頃の娘達が二千人以上も住んでいる丘陵の上に建つている寄宿舎は隠然たる一大女護國であるなんと、なれば、此の工場に働いている男工員の数は僅々百人に満たないからである。
　仕事が終つて部屋へ帰る、八疊一間に五人も六人もの娘が住まつているのだから、大変な騒ぎである。
　窓邊にもたれて、遠い故郷の戀人の事を想いうかべて涙を流しているといった可憐な乙女、すべてを諦めて、仕事、仕事と、一銭でも餘分に親元へ送金してやりたいとゆう孝行娘も澤山あるが、中には青春の情熱のはけ口を求めて、悶々の情やる方なく、センチメンタルな流行歌を唱いながら騒ぎまわる娘もある。
　山手から流れてきて、此の工場の用水として一度の勤めを果した川は建物の横を通つて町の方へ流れてゆく。この川に架つた橋の上が、彼女達織娘が、浮世の風にふれることの出来る唯一の場所なのである。
　夏の夕暮、橋の兩側の手摺には、工場の乙女達が鈴成りになつて、涼んでいる。流行歌や口笛が聞えるしキャッ／＼と言う若い女特有の甲高い嬌聲がそこらから洩れてくる。
　街の若い男が、この橋を通りかかろうものなら大變である。
　遥か彼方を歩いている時から、
「来た、来た」
と見張りの者が、注進に及ぶ、それとばかり、各々持場について待期する。そんなことを露知らない男が、いい調子で歩いてくると、
「ヨー色男ッ、澄ましてるネ」
「何んとかお言いよ、聾かい」
とか何んとか、猥褻な言葉で嘲笑しかける。これが女達に愉快なことであるらしい、が男の方で、此れに對して、
「何に言ってやがるんだい」
女ばかりと侮つて言い返えしたら、それをきっかけに、ワッと兩側からバッタの様に、襲いかかつてくる娘子軍の攻撃を甘受しなければならない。
　大勢に無勢、案外敵せず、残念ながら遂に大の男が、娘たちによつて手とり足とり忽ちのうちに、程近い工場の廣場一隅の叢の中へ運びこまれる。
　多数の力は恐ろしいものだ、足をバラ／＼させようが、もがこうがそんなことはどうにもならない。夏草の生い茂つた岸の上へ放り出されて入れかわり立ちかわり休むひまなく彼女達の纖手によつてさいなまれるなにしろ一日中、繊細な仕事に従つている手先だから、たまつたもの

### A Story of a Man Ravished by Women
By Ninchoji Minoru / Illustrated by Minami Yoji

Young people today may not recognize the term *Joko Aishi* (The Pitiful History of Female Factory Workers), but back when Japan’s spinning industry was at its peak, it was a phrase on everyone’s lips. In those days, quite unlike today, rural villages were gasping in the depths of poverty. When the daughters of these poor farmers reached a certain age, they were sent off to weaving factories in the cities to earn a living. Brokers would descend upon the countryside, using "advance loans" or "relocation fees" of a mere twenty or thirty yen as bait to round up the girls. Looking back, their daily wages were a pittance—a miserable thirty or forty sen.

During that era, I was a low-ranking government official traveling frequently on business. Just as the rainy season ended and the heat began to set in, I stayed for a week at an inn in front of a major station along the Tokaido Line. After dinner, I went for a stroll in light clothes. The town was charming, with a clear, abundant river flowing through its center and several picturesque bridges.

After an hour of walking, I grew thirsty and ducked into a small eatery on the outskirts of town to order some shaved ice, which had just come into season. Three or four young men who looked like laborers came in, ordered Ramune and ice water, and began talking loudly. Their conversation was so intriguing that I couldn't help but overhear. Piecing it together, this is what I gathered:

Just north of the town stood one of the largest spinning factories along the rail line. Over two thousand "weaving princesses" worked there. All were migrants from rural villages, housed together in dormitories. Though some occasionally tried to flee the meager rations and grueling labor, guards were posted at every key point to ensure any "wayward" souls were caught and brought back.

This dormitory, perched on a hill and housing over two thousand girls in the bloom of their youth, was a veritable "Isle of Women." This was especially true since there were fewer than a hundred male workers in the entire factory. When the workday ended and they returned to their rooms—where five or six girls were crammed into a single eight-mat space—it was a scene of great commotion. There were lovely maidens leaning against windows, weeping for lovers back in distant villages; filial daughters who had resigned themselves to a life of "work, work, work" just to send an extra sen home to their parents; and others who, seeking an outlet for their youthful passions, would sing sentimental pop songs and make a ruckus to vent their frustrations.

The river that flowed down from the hills served its purpose as industrial water for the factory before continuing past the buildings toward the town. The bridge over this river was the only place where these girls could catch a breath of the outside world. On summer evenings, they would cluster thickly along the railings to cool off. You could hear popular songs, whistling, and the high-pitched, coquettish squeals unique to young women echoing through the air.

If a young man from town happened to pass over this bridge, he was in for an ordeal. From the moment he was spotted in the distance, a lookout would cry out, "He’s coming! He’s coming!" and the girls would move into their positions. The man, completely unaware, would stroll along casually until they began jeering at him with suggestive remarks: "Hey there, handsome! Why the serious face?" or "Say something! What, are you deaf?"

It seemed the girls found this immensely entertaining. However, if the man made the mistake of looking down on them because they were "just women" and snapped back, "What did you say?!", it would trigger an all-out assault. Like a swarm of locusts, the "maiden army" would descend upon him from both sides. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, even a grown man stood no chance. In an instant, they would seize him by the arms and legs and carry him off into the thickets at the edge of the factory plaza.

The power of a crowd is a terrifying thing. No matter how much he flailed or struggled, it was useless. Tossed onto the grassy bank, he would be tormented without reprieve by their "slender hands" as they took turns. After all, these were hands used to delicate, precision work all day long; for a man to be at their mercy was quite more than he could bear.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Hierarchy**: The text follows a traditional vertical layout (read right to left, top to bottom). The title is exceptionally large and stylized, using bold, hand-drawn calligraphy that dominates the right side of the page to grab the reader's attention.
*   **Typography**: The main body text uses a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-20th-century Japanese publishing. There is a clear distinction between the narrative text and the dialogue, which is occasionally indented or set off with brackets.
*   **Columns**: The page is divided into vertical columns separated by thin lines. This layout is typical of "B5" or "A5" sized monthly magazines (*zasshi*) from the 1950s.
*   **Graphic Elements**: At the bottom of the page, there is a simple horizontal line with the page number "24". The title block includes the names of the author and the illustrator, indicating this was a feature story or a "documentary fiction" piece.
*   **Visual Strategy**: The title is sensationalist ("A Story of a Man Ravished by Women"), intended to provoke curiosity. The contrast between the serious opening (referencing the historical suffering of mill workers) and the scandalous anecdote that follows is a classic "bait-and-switch" editorial tactic used in "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines or general interest weeklies.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Joko Aishi (女工哀史)**: This refers to the 1925 book by Hosoi Wakizo, which exposed the brutal working conditions, low pay, and sexual exploitation of female workers in Japan's textile industry during the Meiji and Taisho eras. By the time this article was written (likely the 1950s), the term had become a well-known shorthand for industrial tragedy.
*   **Post-War "Isle of Women"**: In the post-WWII era, large textile factories continued to employ thousands of young women from impoverished rural areas (Tohoku, etc.). These women lived in strictly controlled dormitories. The text uses the term *Nyogogashima* (女護島), a legendary island inhabited only by women, to describe the factory setting.
*   **Tokaido Line (東海道線)**: The main railway artery connecting Tokyo and Osaka. The setting (Mishima, Numazu, or Fuji in Shizuoka Prefecture) was a hub for the textile industry due to the abundance of fresh water from Mt. Fuji.
*   **Gender Dynamics**: The story portrays a rare reversal of the era's power dynamics. While these women were historically victims of systemic exploitation, the anecdote describes a moment of "mob justice" or "carnivalesque" rebellion where they use their numbers to overwhelm a lone male outsider.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **手篭め (Tekome)**: Usually means to violate or rape a woman. Using it for a man is a deliberate, sensationalist inversion.
*   **周旋人 (Shūsen-nin)**: A broker or middleman. In this context, it refers to recruiters who went to villages to "buy" the labor of young daughters.
*   **お話にならない (O-hanashi ni naranai)**: Literally "doesn't even become a conversation," meaning "absurd," "out of the question," or "not worth mentioning."
*   **出稼ぎ (Dekasegi)**: Leaving one's village to work in the city, usually seasonally or for a few years, to support a family.
*   **嬌声 (Kyōsei)**: High-pitched, often flirtatious or shrill female voices.
*   **娘子軍 (Jōshigun)**: Literally "Army of Young Women." A term used for a group of spirited or aggressive girls.
*   **繊手 (Senshu)**: "Slender hands." A poetic way to describe a woman's hands, which ironically become instruments of "torment" in the story.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Power of the Collective**: The central theme is how individuals who are powerless in the social hierarchy (young, poor factory girls) gain a terrifying sort of power when they act as a "maiden army." 
*   **Sexual Frustration and Release**: The text explicitly mentions "youthful passion's outlet" (*seishun no jōnetsu no hakeguchi*). The attack on the man is framed not as a crime, but as an explosion of pent-up energy from girls living under "intense labor" and "strict surveillance."
*   **Nostalgia and Transition**: The author frames the story as a memory from his days as a young official. There is a sense of looking back at a "wilder" or "rawer" Japan that was disappearing during the high-growth period of the 1950s/60s.
*   **Sensationalism**: While the beginning sounds like social commentary, the ending leans into pulp fiction tropes—the "fear" of being overwhelmed by a group of women—which would have appealed to the male readership of mid-century magazines.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type**: Essay / Narrative Non-fiction (possibly "True Story" genre)
*   **Era**: Late 1940s to 1950s (Post-war retrospective)
*   **Themes**: Industrialization, Gender Roles, Rural Poverty, Social History, Sensationalism, Labor Conditions
*   **Classification**: Adult/General Interest Magazine, Pulp Literature
