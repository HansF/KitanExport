「！ そんな格好ぢやみつともない、」
　脱ぎ捨てた着物を掴んで、ポイとかねに抛つてやり、折から
「ど、どうしたんですのよ、騒々しい」
　叫びながら駈けつけて来た女将さんの肩をポンと叩いて階段にまで突き返し、
「女将さん、なんでもないんだ、慌てちやいけない。さあ下へ降りたり降りたり、あとはあつしが、うまく取りつくらうからな」
　さういつて、とう／＼女将を階下へ押しやつてしまい、尚吉の傍へ駈け寄ると、
「尚さんッ！ しつかりしねえツ！」
　荒つぽく首つ玉を抱えて抱き起し背中をぴしやつとどやしつけた。
「おッ！？？」
　正気にかえつた尚吉は、とぼけた狸のような面でキョロ／＼辺りを見廻したが、急に顔を掩うと、わあ〜と子供のように泣き出した。
「なんだ、みつともねえ、さあ、おめえが、いちや話が出来ねえ、降りなー」
　尚吉の腕をとつて引きずるように部屋の外へ押し出し、ピタリと障子を締め切り、
「さあ、杉浦さん、おかみさん、ちよつとそこへお座りなせえ、すんだことは仕方がねえ、なあ、杉浦さんとやらおめえさんもひとの娘を黙つて寝とり亭主を部屋の外まで抛り投げ、運よく呼吸を吹きかえしたからよかつたものの、もし、あつしがいなくて活を入れなかつたら、おめえは死刑か無期徒刑だぜ、いや〜、おめえさんだつていい年をして、そんなことは山程あろうが、盗人も三分理屈、こりや誰が考えたつておめえさんが悪い、そこでだ、おめえさんも悪いと知つたらすつぱりと諦め、慰藉料といやあ聞こえがいいが、ほんの鼻くそほどでいいから五万円ほど金庫の中から唸つている札束の端くれを引つこ抜いて尚さんにホドコシしてやりやあ済んだつて、なあに、あつしが得心させるから、どうですい？ たつたそれだけでパンパンと片がつくんですぜ」
　杉浦源吉は、ケロリとした顔で、唾を飛ばしてまくしたてる菊三のひよつとこ面を面白そうに眺めながら、スパリ〜と煙草を吸つていたが、
「話はよく分かりました。もういうことはありませんか？ ――ぢや、おかねさんゆきましょう」
　立つ上つて二人が出て行こうとするので、慌てた菊三が、パツと杉浦の着物の袖を掴んで
「待つたあッ！ 杉浦さんッ！ それやあ、あつしは、狐につままれたようなもんだ。さあ、五万円、出すか出さんかはつきりいつて貰わなきや、この袖死んでも離さねえツ」
　菊三は、歌舞伎役者のように片膝ついてぎよろりと眼を剥いた。

「ホホホ」
　女のように笑つて杉浦は
「ぢや、五万円渡すからそこを離してくれ」
　ひよいと袖を拂つて廊下へ出た。
「ま、まつたあッ！ 杉浦さんッ！ い、いつ渡すんだあッ！」
　追いすがつて、また杉浦の袖をとらえようとするので、パンとその手を叩いて杉浦は
「おとといおいで」
「な、なにツ！」
　菊三は一生一代の跳躍を試みて、ひゆつと杉浦めがけて飛びついた。
「あッ！」
　飛びのいたかねは、白いかたびら姿の杉浦が、ついにそいなつたのに、どしん！ と大きな音がして長たらしい菊三のからだが手足を思いきり伸ばして蛙でもぶつけたように俯伏している。
「おかねさん、早くッ」
　いつの間に吹つ飛んだのか杉浦源吉の白いかたびら姿が薄暗い廊下の彼方で、手をひつこめた袖口をひよい〜振りながらまねいている。
　おかねは、夢でみた白狐をふと思い出して
「きやあッ！」
　叫ぶと同時に、堅く手を握りしめたまま卒倒してしまつた。
「聞男（ききお）するな淫賣（いんばい）するな」
　おかねは、昏睡状態の暗闇で、大きなダイヤの指輪の中に無数の白狐が、太い尾をぴよん／＼振りながら踊つている夢をみていた。 ――終――

「！ そんな格好じゃみっともない、」
脱ぎ捨てた着物をつかんで、ポイとおかねに放ってやり、折から
「ど、どうしたんですのよ、騒々しい」
叫びながら駆けつけてきた女将さんの肩をポンと叩いて階段にまで突き返し、
「女将さん、なんでもないんだ、慌てちゃいけない。さあ下へ降りなさい、あとはあっしが、うまく取り繕うからな」
そう言って、とうとう女将を階下へ押しやってしまい、尚吉の傍へ駆け寄ると、
「尚さん！しっかりしねえ！」
荒っぽく首ったけを抱えて抱き起こし、背中をピシャッとどやしつけた。
「おっ！？」
正気に返った尚吉は、とぼけた狸のような面でキョロキョロ辺りを見回したが、急に顔を覆うと、わーっと子供のように泣き出した。
「なんだ、みっともねえ、さあ、お前がいては話ができない、降りな」
尚吉の腕を取って引きずるように部屋の外へ押し出し、ピタリと障子を締め切り、
「さあ、杉浦さん、おかみさん、ちょっとそこへお座りなさい。済んだことは仕方がねえ。なあ、杉浦さんとやら、お前さんも人の娘を黙って寝取り、亭主を部屋の外まで放り投げ、運よく息を吹き返したからよかったものの、もし、あっしがいなくて活を入れなかったら、お前は死刑か無期徒刑だぜ。いや、お前さんだっていい年をして、そんなことは山ほどあろうが、盗人も三分理屈、これは誰が考えたってお前さんが悪い。そこでだ、お前さんも悪いと知ったらすっぱりと諦め、慰謝料と言えば聞こえがいいが、ほんの鼻くそほどでいいから五万円ほど金庫の中から唸っている札束の端くれを引き抜いて尚さんに施してやりゃあ済んだって、なあに、あっしが納得させるから、どうですい？ たったそれだけでパンパンと片がつくんですぜ」
杉浦源吉は、けろりとした顔で、唾を飛ばしてまくしたてる菊三のひょっとこ面を面白そうに眺めながら、スパスパと煙草を吸っていたが、
「話はよく分かりました。もう言うことはありませんか？ ――じゃあ、おかねさん行きましょう」
立ち上がって二人が出て行こうとするので、慌てた菊三が、パッと杉浦の着物の袖を掴んで
「待ったあ！ 杉浦さん！ それじゃあ、あっしは、狐につままれたようなもんだ。さあ、五万円、出すか出さないかはっきり言ってもらわなきゃ、この袖、死んでも離さねえ！」
菊三は、歌舞伎役者のように片膝ついてぎょろりと目を剥いた。

「ホホホ」
女のように笑って杉浦は
「じゃあ、五万円渡すからそこを離してくれ」
ひょいと袖を払って廊下へ出た。
「ま、待ったあ！ 杉浦さん！ い、いつ渡すんだあ！」
追いすがって、また杉浦の袖を捉えようとするので、パンとその手を叩いて杉浦は
「おとといおいで」
「な、何っ！」
菊三は一生一代の跳躍を試みて、ひゅっと杉浦めがけて飛びついた。
「あっ！」
飛びのいたおかねは、白い帷子（かたびら）姿の杉浦が、ついにそうなったのに、どしん！ と大きな音がして長たらしい菊三の体が手足を思いきり伸ばして蛙でもぶつけたようにうつ伏している。
「おかねさん、早く！」
いつの間に吹っ飛んだのか、杉浦源吉の白い帷子姿が薄暗い廊下の彼方で、手を引っ込めた袖口をひょいひょい振りながら招いている。
おかねは、夢で見た白狐をふと思い出して
「きゃあ！」
叫ぶと同時に、硬く手を握りしめたまま卒倒してしまった。
「間男（まおとこ）するな淫売（いんばい）するな」
おかねは、昏睡状態の暗闇で、大きなダイヤの指輪の中に無数の白狐が、太い尾をぴょんぴょん振りながら踊っている夢を見ていた。 ――終――

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"! That appearance is unseemly,"
Grabbing the discarded kimono, [he] tossed it to Okane with a "poi," and at that moment,
"Wh-what happened, [it is] noisy,"
Tapping the shoulder of the mistress (Okamisan) who came running while shouting, [he] pushed her back to the stairs,
"Mistress, it is nothing, do not be flustered. Now, go down, go down; after this, I will skillfully fix things up."
Saying so, [he] finally pushed the mistress downstairs and, running to Shōkichi's side,
"Shō-san! Pull yourself together!"
Roughly grabbing [his] neck and pulling [him] up, [he] smacked [his] back with a "pishatsu."
"Oh!?"
Shōkichi, who returned to his senses, looked around with a face like a fooled tanuki, but suddenly covering his face, he began to cry "waaa" like a child.
"What, [this is] unseemly; now, if you are here, talk cannot be done; go down—"
Taking Shōkichi's arm and dragging him, [he] pushed him out of the room, closed the shoji screen tightly,
"Now, Sugiura-san, Okamisan (Okane), please sit there for a moment. Things done cannot be helped. Hey, Sugiura-san or whatever, you too, secretly sleeping with someone's daughter and throwing the husband out of the room, it was good because he luckily regained his breath, but if I hadn't been here to give him 'katsu' (revival), you would be [facing] death penalty or life imprisonment. No, even you are at a good age, there must be mountains of such things, but even a thief has 'three-parts logic' (excuses). This, whoever thinks about it, you are bad. Therefore, if you know you are bad, give up cleanly—calling it 'solatium' (alimony) sounds good, but just a snot-sized amount is fine, pull out about 50,000 yen worth of the ends of the bundles of bills groaning inside your safe and bestow it to Shō-san, and it will be settled. Hey, I will make him convinced, so how is it? With just that, things will be settled 'pan-pan' (quickly)."
Sugiura Genkichi, while looking with interest at the 'hyottoko' (clown) face of Kikuzō who was talking profusely while spitting saliva with an unperturbed face, was smoking a cigarette with a "supari,"
"I understood the talk well. Is there nothing more to say? —Then, Okane-san, let us go."
As the two stood up to leave, the panicked Kikuzō suddenly grabbed the sleeve of Sugiura's kimono,
"Wait! Sugiura-san! Then, I am like someone possessed by a fox. Now, 50,000 yen, you must clearly tell me whether you will give it or not; even if I die, I won't let go of this sleeve!"
Kikuzō, like a Kabuki actor, knelt on one knee and glared with wide eyes.

"Ho ho ho"
Laughing like a woman, Sugiura [said],
"Then, I will give 50,000 yen, so let go of there."
Lightly flicking the sleeve, [he] went out to the corridor.
"W-wait! Sugiura-san! Wh-when will you give it!"
Rushing after him, trying to catch Sugiura's sleeve again, Sugiura slapped that hand with a "pan" and [said],
"Come back the day before yesterday" (Not happening).
"Wh-what!"
Kikuzō attempted the jump of a lifetime and leaped toward Sugiura with a "hyu."
"Ah!"
Okane, who jumped back—Sugiura in his white katabira had finally [done] that—a "doshin!" loud sound occurred, and Kikuzō's long body, stretching hands and feet with all its might, is lying face down as if a frog was smashed.
"Okane-san, quickly!"
When did he fly there? Sugiura Genkichi's white katabira figure is at the far end of the dim corridor, beckoning while lightly shaking his sleeve-cuff where his hand was pulled in.
Okane, suddenly remembering the white fox she saw in a dream,
"Kyaa!"
At the same time as the scream, while clutching her hands tight, she fainted.
"Do not commit adultery, do not commit prostitution."
Okane, in the darkness of a comatose state, was seeing a dream where inside a large diamond ring, countless white foxes were dancing while wagging their thick tails "pyon-pyon." —End—

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Blast! You look a mess in that state!" 
He grabbed her discarded kimono and tossed it toward Okane. Just then, the mistress of the house came running up, shouting, "My goodness, what’s all this racket?" 
He gave her a shove on the shoulder, sent her back down the stairs, and barked, "It’s nothing, Ma’am, don’t get your feathers ruffled! Just head back down. I’ll take care of everything up here."
Having forced her back downstairs, he rushed to Shōkichi’s side.
"Shō! Snap out of it!"
He grabbed the man by the scruff of his neck, hauled him up, and gave him a sharp, stinging smack across the back.
"Wha—!?"
Shōkichi came to his senses, looking around with the dazed expression of a bamboozled tanuki. Suddenly, he buried his face in his hands and began to wail like a child.
"Oh, for heaven’s sake, have some dignity! Look, I can’t talk business with you here. Get downstairs!"
He grabbed Shōkichi by the arm, dragged him out of the room, and slid the shoji doors shut with a definitive *thud*.

"Now then, Mr. Sugiura, and you, Okane, have a seat. What’s done is done. Now, Sugiura—or whatever your name is—you’ve gone and bedded another man’s daughter and tossed the husband out like trash. It’s a miracle he started breathing again; if I hadn't been here to shock him back to life, you’d be looking at the gallows or a life sentence. Look, you’re a man of the world; I’m sure you’ve got plenty of skeletons in your closet. But as they say, even a thief has his reasons—and in this case, anyone can see you’re the villain. So, if you know you’re in the wrong, just pay up and be done with it. 'Alimony' sounds a bit fancy, but let’s just say you pull a measly fifty thousand yen—hardly more than pocket change—out of those fat stacks groaning in your safe and toss a bit Shō’s way. I’ll make sure he’s satisfied. Well? It’s a small price to pay to settle this whole mess in a jiffy."

Sugiura Genkichi watched with an amused, nonchalant expression as Kikuzō ranted, spit flying from his twisted, clown-like face. Sugiura took a long, slow drag of his cigarette.
"I believe I understand. Are you quite finished? ...Very well. Okane, let’s go."
As the two rose to leave, a panicked Kikuzō lunged forward and snatched Sugiura’s sleeve.
"Wait! Mr. Sugiura! You can’t just leave me hanging like this! Now, are you going to pay the fifty thousand or not? Give me a straight answer, or I’ll never let go of this sleeve, even if it kills me!" 
Kikuzō dropped to one knee like a Kabuki villain, his eyes bulging with theatrical intensity.

"Ho ho ho!"
Sugiura gave a high, feminine laugh. "Fine. I’ll pay the fifty thousand. Now let go."
He flicked his sleeve free and stepped out into the hallway.
"W-wait! Sugiura! When are you going to pay!?" 
Kikuzō scrambled after him, reaching for the sleeve again. Sugiura slapped his hand away with a sharp *crack*.
"Come back the day after yesterday," Sugiura mocked.
"Why, you—!"
Kikuzō gathered all his strength for the jump of a lifetime and lunged at Sugiura.
"Ah!"
Okane leapt back. Sugiura, dressed in his white summer robes, moved—and then came a heavy *thud*. Kikuzō’s lanky frame was sprawled on the floor, limbs splayed out like a flattened frog.
"Okane, hurry!"
Sugiura had moved with impossible speed; his white-clad figure was already at the far end of the dim corridor, beckoning her with a flick of his empty sleeve.
The image triggered a memory of a white fox from Okane's dreams. 
"Eek!" 
She let out a piercing shriek and, her fists clenched tight, collapsed in a dead faint.
*Do not commit adultery; do not commit prostitution.*
In the darkness of her unconsciousness, Okane dreamt of a massive diamond ring, inside of which countless white foxes danced, their thick tails bobbing up and down. 

— THE END —

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is presented in a two-column vertical format, typical of Japanese magazines. The page number (73) is centered at the bottom.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of Kanji and Hiragana with small *furigana* (reading aids) for difficult characters. There is a notable use of exclamation marks and emphasis marks (like "ッ" for glottal stops).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The story title isn't present (this is the final page), but the "終" (End) marker indicates the conclusion. The illustration breaks the text block, creating a dynamic visual that captures the climactic tension.
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing (likely ink wash style) shows Sugiura (the "villain/dandy") standing calmly while Okane (the mistress/heroine) cringes or pleads on the ground. The artist's signature appears to be "けいじ 画" (Keiji-ga).
*   **Punctuation:** Includes traditional Japanese quotation marks (「」) and double dashes (――) for pauses or shifts in dialogue.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era:** Likely the late 1940s to early 1950s (Post-WWII/Occupation period). The mention of "50,000 yen" as a significant sum for "alimony" or "solatium" fits this era's inflation and economic scale.
*   **Social Conventions:** The story revolves around "adultery" (間男 - *maotoko*) and "prostitution" (淫売 - *inbai*). In the post-war era, "pan-pan girls" (streetwalkers) were a common social phenomenon, and the text uses "pan-pan" as a pun for "settling things quickly."
*   **The "White Fox" (Inari):** The fox is a common supernatural trope in Japan, often associated with trickery or possession (*kitsune-tsuki*). Sugiura's white robes and feminine laugh evoke the image of a fox spirit (*yōkai*), suggesting he is not a normal man but a trickster.
*   **The 50,000 Yen:** To put it in perspective, in the early 1950s, the starting salary for a teacher might have been around 5,000–8,000 yen a month. 50,000 yen was a substantial payoff.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **あっし (Asshi):** A rough, masculine first-person pronoun often used by craftsmen, gamblers, or "low-class" city dwellers in old Tokyo (Edo) slang.
*   **女将さん (Okamisan):** The mistress of an inn or a restaurant; here, it refers to the landlady of the house.
*   **慰藉料 (Isharyō):** Consolation money or solatium (often paid in cases of adultery or divorce).
*   **ひょっとこ面 (Hyottoko-men):** A "distorted face" like the traditional Hyottoko mask, used to describe Kikuzō's ugly or comical angry expression.
*   **おとといおいで (Ototoi oide):** Literally "Come back the day before yesterday." A sarcastic idiom meaning "Not a chance" or "Beat it."
*   **帷子 (Katabira):** A light, unlined hemp or linen kimono worn in summer. Sugiura's white *katabira* gives him a ghostly, fox-like appearance.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Deception and Trickery:** The protagonist Kikuzō tries to "extort" money from the wealthy Sugiura by playing on his guilt, but Sugiura (the fox-like figure) outsmarts and physically overpowers him.
*   **Post-War Morality:** The ending "Moral" (*Do not commit adultery; do not commit prostitution*) feels like a tongue-in-cheek nod to censorship or the "kasutori" genre's habit of mixing erotic/scandalous content with a superficial moralizing tone.
*   **Class Conflict:** The "rough" Kikuzō versus the "refined" but cruel Sugiura. Kikuzō uses Kabuki-like gestures, showing he is a man of theatricality and bluster, whereas Sugiura's power is quiet and supernatural.
*   **Gender and Power:** Okane is caught between these men, ultimately collapsing from the stress, dreaming of wealth (the diamond ring) and the supernatural (the foxes).

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story (Pulp/Kasutori)
*   **Genre:** Drama, Crime, Noir, Supernatural (light)
*   **Thematic Tags:** Adultery, Extortion, Post-war Japan, Folklore (Foxes), Melodrama, Greed.
