　その年の冬、両国の宿小屋を借りて興行した。章魚娘は、仕込みに対して金のかからなかった割にかなり当たった。本物の「章魚娘」は、踊るでもなく、歌うでもなく、ただ、華やかな衣装をつけて、時々、身体の一部を見せるだけであったが、それでも見物は、他愛もなく満足しているようであった。
　が、それも僅か二ヶ月の間で、いつの間にか姿を消したかと思うと、築地堀の新道で、四十二になる幾分限の福助に、囲われていた。女という獲物の生血を吸い尽くす蜘蛛男はそれからそれへと餌を漁って、決して、一人の女を永く自分の傍へ置くようなことをしなかった。が、この「章魚娘」のお千代だけは、例外であった。めったに外へも出さず愛撫していた。
　新道の溝板に、師走の霜の厚いある朝のことであった。福助の家を訪ねたのは、略奪（りゃくだつ）以来失業している甲州松と、「章魚娘」を彼に売り込んだ、両国の香具師（やし）熊ン蜂の吉五郎であった。
「御免よ──おい、福さんは家（うち）かね？」
　つい、今しがた起きたばかりの福助は、その声の主が熊ン蜂であることを知って、ちょっと眉をひそめたが、子供の羽織ほどのドテラを引っかけて玄関へ出た。
「ふん、吉さんかね、ばかに早いじゃないか──」
「朝っぱらから、邪魔をして済まねえが、こちらの家に御厄介になっているお千代のことで、ちいっと、とききたい事があるんで出掛けて来たんだ。おい、松、手前（てめえ）もこっちへ入って、あとを閉めな」吉五郎は外に立っている甲州松を振り返った。
　吉五郎は一寸法師の福助に比べると、関取り（力士）のように見える大きな身体をして、どっかり胡座（あぐら）をかいた。その胸毛だけでも、福助を圧迫するに十分であった。
「ねえ、福さん、手っ取り早く言うがね、実は、お前さんの小屋の掛け物に世話をしたお千代という女は、俺の小屋で使っている者の女房なんだ。いいかね、俺はあの女の亭主から頼まれて見世物に出す世話はしたが、おめえの慰みものにされたんじゃ、その男に対して、俺が顔向けが出来ねえんだ。間男は天下の御法度（ごはっと）だったよね。おい、福さん、この収まりを、どうしてくれるんだい？」
　熊ン蜂の言葉には、鋭い針を持っていた。
「まあ、兄貴（あにい）、そんなに大きな声を出さなくても、話はわかるじゃないか。この親方だって、まんざら野暮なこたあ言わないだろうから。ねえ、親方、そうでございましょう？」となだめるように言ったのは、甲州松であった。
　人妻だ、不倫だと言われた福助は、ひどく狼狽（うろた）えたが、一応女に聞き出すつもりで声をかけた。「はい、なんだよ、ずいぶん騒々（せわし）ないねえ」
　しどけない寝間着姿で、お千代は美しい顔を現した。
「さっきから、実は私も気をもんでいたんだよ。ねえ、お前さん！ もうこうなったら仕方がないじゃないか。今さら、別れるのなんのということもできないし。だから、できる限りのものを都合して、吉親方にお渡ししなよ。それより他に、決着のつけようはないじゃないか。ねえ、松さん……」
　落ち着き払って、女は、福助と松に向かって言った。
　それで結局、福助は持っているだけのものを、残らず熊ン蜂と甲州松に提供して、ようやく帰ってもらった。
　その翌朝、目を覚ますと、傍に寝ているはずのお千代の姿が消えていた。賭場（御開帳）と略奪で儲けた「蜘蛛男」の福助は、最後の章魚娘で、すっかり一文無しになってしまったのであった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

That year's winter, borrowing a lodging hut in Ryogoku, [they] held a performance. Regarding the "Octopus Girl," for the fact that money was not spent on the preparations, it hit [was successful] considerably. The real "Octopus Girl" did not dance, did not sing, only, wearing a gaudy costume, sometimes just showing a part of [her] body, but even so the spectators seemed innocently satisfied.

But that was for only a period of two months; when one thought she had vanished, in the new road of the Tsukiji moat, she was kept by a forty-two-year-old wealthy man of small stature, Fukusuke. The "Spider Man" who sucks dry the lifeblood of prey called women, fished for bait one after another, and never did such a thing as keeping one woman by his side for long. But, only this "Octopus Girl" Otchiyo was an exception. He rarely let her outside and caressed her.

It was a certain morning with thick frost of the twelfth month on the ditch boards of the new road. The ones who visited Fukusuke's house were Koshu Matsu, who had been unemployed since a plunder, and the Ryogoku street performer Kumambachi (Hornet) Kichigoro, who had sold the "Octopus Girl" to him. "Excuse me—Hey, is Fuku-san at home?"

Fukusuke, who had just now woken up, knowing the owner of that voice was Kumambachi, knitted his brows slightly but threw on a padded robe about the size of a child's coat and went to the entrance.

"Hmm, is it Kichi-san? Isn't it incredibly early?"

"Sorry to disturb you from first thing in the morning, but regarding Otchiyo who is being taken care of at this house, there is something I want to ask a bit, so I came out. Hey, Matsu, you come in here too and close [the door] behind you." Kichigoro looked back at Koshu Matsu standing outside.

Kichigoro, compared to the dwarf Fukusuke, had a large body that looked like a sumo wrestler and sat down heavily in a cross-legged position. Even his chest hair alone was enough to pressure Fukusuke.

"Hey, Fuku-san, I'll say it quickly: actually, the woman named Otchiyo, who I helped set up as a showpiece in your hut, is the wife of someone working in my hut. Listen, I helped put her in the show at the request of that woman's husband, but if she is made into your plaything, I can't show my face to that man. Adultery is the law of the land, isn't it? Hey, Fuku-san, how are you going to settle this?"

Kumambachi's words held a sharp needle.

"Now, now, Big Brother, even if you don't raise such a loud voice, the story can be understood, can't it? This boss here won't say such unrefined things. Hey Boss, isn't that right?" The one who said this to mediate was Koshu Matsu.

Fukusuke, having been told "married woman" and "adultery," was terribly flustered, but intended to ask the woman and called out. "Yes, what is it? It's quite restless, isn't it?"
In a disheveled nightgown, Otchiyo showed her beautiful face.

"From a while ago, actually I was also worried, hey, dear! Now that it's come to this, it can't be helped, can it? At this point, things like breaking up cannot be done... so, arrange whatever you can and give it to Boss Kichi. Other than that, there is no way to settle it, is there? Hey, Matsu-san..." Calmly, the woman said toward Fukusuke and Matsu.

In the end, Fukusuke provided everything he had without remainder to Kumambachi and Koshu Matsu, and finally had them go home.
The next morning, when he woke up, the figure of Otchiyo, who should have been sleeping beside him, had vanished. Fukusuke, the "Spider Man" who had profited from gambling and plunder, became completely penniless because of the last Octopus Girl.
--End--

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

In the winter of that year, a sideshow troupe rented a shack in the Ryogoku district to put on a performance. Their headline act, the "Octopus Girl," proved to be a surprisingly lucrative hit, especially considering how little had been spent on the production. The girl herself neither sang nor danced; she simply wore a garish costume and occasionally revealed glimpses of her flesh. Yet the crowds, in their simple-mindedness, seemed perfectly satisfied.

The show lasted a mere two months. No sooner had the girl vanished from the stage than she was found installed as the mistress of a forty-two-year-old dwarf named Fukusuke, a man of some means living in the newly developed district of Tsukiji. Fukusuke was a "Spider Man" of sorts, a predator who would suck the lifeblood from his female "prey" before moving on to the next. He never kept a woman for long—except for Otchiyo, the Octopus Girl. He was obsessed with her, keeping her hidden away and showering her with affection.

One frigid December morning, frost lay thick upon the wooden boards of the Tsukiji lanes. Two men arrived at Fukusuke's doorstep: Koshu Matsu, a petty thief who had been out of work since his last heist, and Kumambachi Kichigoro, a Ryogoku street-hustler who had been the one to "sell" the Octopus Girl to Fukusuke in the first place.

"Pardon the intrusion! Hey, is Fuku-san in?"

Fukusuke, who had only just crawled out of bed, recognized Kichigoro’s voice immediately. He scowled but threw on a *dotera*—a padded robe so small it looked like it belonged to a child—and went to the door.

"Kichi-san? You’re here awfully early, aren't you?"

"Sorry to bother you at the crack of dawn, but I've got a bit of a question regarding this Otchiyo you’ve got staying here. Hey, Matsu, get in here and shut the door behind you." Kichigoro barked at his companion.

Compared to the diminutive Fukusuke, Kichigoro was a giant of a man with the build of a sumo wrestler. He sat himself down heavily, his thick chest hair alone enough to intimidate the little man.

"Look, Fuku-san, I’ll get straight to the point," Kichigoro began. "The girl I set you up with—Otchiyo—well, it turns out she’s the wife of one of my workers. I only agreed to put her in the show because her husband asked me to help them out. But if I let her become your little plaything, I won't be able to look her husband in the eye. And as you know, adultery is a crime against the Shogun's law. So, Fuku-san, how do you plan to make this right?"

Kichigoro’s words were like the sting of his namesake, the hornet.

"Now, now, Boss, there’s no need to shout," Matsu chimed in smoothly. "I’m sure the Master here is a reasonable man. Isn't that right, Master?"

Fukusuke, accused of being an adulterer, was thrown into a panic. He called out to the woman to get her side of the story. 

"Yes, what's all the fuss about?" Otchiyo appeared, looking beautiful even in her disheveled nightclothes.

"I've been worried about this for a while, dear!" she cried. "Now that the truth is out, there's no turning back. We can't very well part ways now, can we? The only thing to do is to get whatever money you can together and give it to Boss Kichi to settle things. It’s the only way, isn't it, Matsu-san?"

With a cool, practiced air, the woman looked from Fukusuke to Matsu.

Terrified, Fukusuke handed over every cent he had to Kichigoro and Matsu just to make them leave. But when he woke the next morning, Otchiyo was gone. The "Spider Man" who had made his fortune through crooked gambling and theft had been fleeced of his very last penny by the Octopus Girl.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese periodical style, with vertical text running from right to left. It uses two main columns, though the illustrations break the columnar flow, creating a dynamic visual narrative.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho style typical of the mid-20th century. Furigana (reading aids) are used extensively, particularly for names (章魚娘/たこむすめ, 熊ン蜂/くまんばち) and difficult or period-specific kanji (衣裳/いしょう, 捕物/とりもの context).
*   **Illustrations:** There are two distinct illustrations. 
    1.  The top illustration shows the confrontation at the entrance. The large man (Kichigoro) towers over the smaller man (Fukusuke). The style is reminiscent of *ukiyo-e* but modernized for 20th-century print media.
    2.  The bottom illustration shows the woman (Otchiyo) in her nightgown appearing before the men. A lantern with "甲州屋" (Koshuya) is visible, grounding the scene in a specific (likely fictional) establishment.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title or introductory line is set in slightly larger or emphasized spacing at the top right. The use of "──終──" (The End) at the bottom left indicates this is a self-contained short story or a final installment of a series.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (1940s-1960s):** While the story is set in the Edo period (1603-1868), the orthography (using *kyu-kanazukai* like "あつた" instead of "あった") suggests it was published either before or shortly after the 1946 script reforms. Magazines like *Kodan Club* or *King* were popular during this time, specializing in "Ero-Guro-Nonsense" or "Pulp Jidaigeki" (period dramas) that combined historical settings with crime, suspense, and mild eroticism.
*   **Ryogoku and Sideshows (*Misemono-goya*):** Ryogoku was the heart of entertainment in Edo. *Misemono* (sideshows) featured "freaks," trickery, and exotic displays. The "Octopus Girl" was a famous trope where a woman's head was superimposed on an octopus body using mirrors—a classic example of the "low" entertainment of the era.
*   **Adultery (*Maotoku*):** In the Edo period, adultery was a serious crime. A husband had the legal right to kill his wife and her lover if caught in the act (*megataki-uchi*). This historical fact is used here as the basis for the extortion scam (the "badger game").
*   **Fukusuke:** The name "Fukusuke" refers to a traditional big-headed doll considered a bringer of good luck. In this story, the character is a dwarf (Issun-boshi), and his name is likely ironic or a descriptive nickname.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **章魚娘 (Takomusume):** Literally "Octopus Girl." A sideshow attraction.
*   **香具師 (Yashi/Tekiya):** Itinerant performers, stall-keepers, or street peddlers, often associated with the underworld or organized crime groups in the Edo period.
*   **熊ン蜂 (Kumambachi):** Literally "Hornet." A nickname suggesting the character is dangerous and "stings."
*   **一寸法師 (Issun-boshi):** Traditionally a "Little One-Inch" hero from folklore; here used as a descriptive term for a dwarf.
*   **どてら (Dotera):** A heavy, padded winter kimono/robe.
*   **間男 (Maotoku):** A term for an adulterous male lover.
*   **御法度 (Go-hatto):** Strict laws or prohibitions issued by the Shogunate.
*   **御開帳 (Gokaicho):** Literally the unveiling of a hidden Buddhist statue, but in the underworld slang of the time, it often referred to the opening of a gambling den.
*   **蜘蛛男 (Kumo-otoko):** "Spider Man." Used here as a metaphor for a predatory man who traps and exploits women.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Biter Bit" (Irony):** Fukusuke is introduced as a "Spider Man" who exploits women. The irony is that he is ultimately trapped and drained of his wealth by a woman he thought he controlled.
*   **The Badger Game (*Tsutsugase*):** This is a classic depiction of a honey trap or extortion scam. The "husband" (Kichigoro) and the "victim/wife" (Otchiyo) are in league to fleece the mark (Fukusuke).
*   **Masculinity and Power:** The physical contrast between the large, hairy Kichigoro and the tiny Fukusuke emphasizes the power imbalance used during the extortion.
*   **Ero-Guro (Erotic-Grotesque):** The focus on the "Octopus Girl," the "Spider Man" metaphor, the "chest hair," and the woman in "disheveled nightclothes" are all hallmarks of the *Ero-Guro* literary subgenre popular in mid-century Japan.
