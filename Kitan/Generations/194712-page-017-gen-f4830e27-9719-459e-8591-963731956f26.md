露出狂
私は小学校の時分、ある朝、登校の途中に、道ばたで小便をゐたしてゐる女を見つけて、それ以来、常に好奇心をいだいてをります。

その女は、よその町から嫁に来てをりましたが、身持ちの悪い評判が立ってをり、その朝も、誰もゐないとおもひこんで、着物の裾をまくって用を足してゐたのでせう。

私は男ながらも、そのとき女の「そこ」がどんな形をしてゐるのか、何故かくすのか、妙な不安と興奮を感じました。

私は現在、妻も子もゐる身ですが、時々、夜の公園で、密かにコートの下は裸にして立ってをります。誰にも見られぬやうに、しかし、誰かが見てゐるのではないかと云ふ期待に、胸がどきどきいたします。これこそが、私の秘めたる倒錯 (パーヴァース) であります。

私は小学校の時分、ある朝、登校の途中に、道端で小便をしている女を見つけて、それ以来、常に好奇心を抱いております。

その女は、よその町から嫁に来ておりましたが、身持ちの悪い評判が立っており、その朝も、誰もいないと思い込んで、着物の裾をまくって用を足していたのでしょう。

私は男ながらも、そのとき女の「そこ」がどんな形をしているのか、なぜ隠すのか、妙な不安と興奮を感じました。

私は現在、妻も子もいる身ですが、時々、夜の公園で、密かにコートの下は裸にして立っております。誰にも見られないように、しかし、誰かが見ているのではないかという期待に、胸がどきどきいたします。これこそが、私の秘めたる倒錯（パーヴァース）であります。

### 3️⃣ Literal Translation (Semantic Fidelity)

```markdown
## Literal English Translation
Exhibitionist
When I was in elementary school, one morning, on my way to school, I discovered a woman urinating by the roadside, and since then, I have always held curiosity.

That woman had come as a bride from another town, but she had a reputation for having poor morals, and that morning, having convinced herself that no one was around, she must have been pulling up the hem of her kimono to relieve herself.

Even though I am a man, at that time, I felt a strange anxiety and excitement regarding what shape the woman's "that place" (soko) was, and why she was hiding it.

Currently, I am a person who has a wife and child, but sometimes, in the park at night, secretly, I stand with my coat being the only thing covering my nakedness underneath. I try not to be seen by anyone, yet my heart pounds with the expectation of wondering if someone might be watching. This indeed is my hidden perversion (pāvāsu).

## Literary English Translation
The Exhibitionist
While I was still in elementary school, I came across a woman urinating by the roadside one morning on my way to school. From that moment on, I have been consumed by an incessant curiosity.

This woman had married into the neighborhood from afar, but she was widely rumored to be loose-moraled. That particular morning, she must have been convinced she was entirely alone, lifting the hem of her kimono to attend to her needs.

Despite being male, I experienced a bizarre mix of anxiety and excitement, captivated by what shape the woman's "place" took, and mystified as to why it had to be concealed.

Even now, I am a family man with a wife and child, yet sometimes in the park at night, I secretly stand completely naked beneath my coat. I strive to ensure that no one sees me, yet my heart races with the fervent expectation that someone might be watching. This, truly, is my secret perversion.
(M. K., age 35)

### 5️⃣ Structural & Editorial Metadata

```markdown
## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader confession / Letter to the Editor (a common feature in *Kitan Club* known as 奇譚告白 or similar). The sensational title (露出狂 / Exhibitionist) identifies the sexual deviance immediately.
*   **Author Attribution:** M・K生 (M. K. sei - implying Contributor or Resident M. K.), Thirty-five years old (三十五歳). This demographic (middle-aged, married man) heightens the tension between social respectability and hidden pathology.
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** The text is strictly the narrator's confessional voice. The editorial hand is evident only in the provocative title and the decision to publish the piece under the pretense of "truth."
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in sexual psychology (倒錯), private moral failures, and the hidden lives of neighbors. The tone is meant to be shocking yet introspective.
*   **Positioning within the magazine:** Likely part of a long sequence of reader confessions detailing abnormal or transgressive sexual acts, positioned to maximize prurient interest.

### 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

```markdown
## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Era Context:** This text reflects the mid-Showa period (1950s-1960s), where urbanization was increasing but traditional social controls and neighborhood gossip (評判 / reputation) were still powerful, especially concerning women's sexuality.
*   **身持ちの悪い評判 (Mimotochi no Warui Hyōban):** "Bad reputation for conduct/morals." This specific phrase almost always refers to female sexual promiscuity or questionable fidelity. The woman's status as a *yome* (bride) makes her conduct highly scrutinized by the community.
*   **Public Urination:** While seen as shocking through modern lenses, public urination was not uncommon in less developed areas of postwar Japan, particularly for men, but exposure by a woman (especially one lifting a kimono) was highly indecent, linking bodily function directly to sexual exposure.
*   **倒錯 (Tōsaku) / パーヴァース (Pāvāsu):** This dual labeling of "perversion" shows the magazine's attempt to provide a pseudo-intellectual or psychiatric framework for its sensational content, drawing on contemporary interest in Western sexology (Krafft-Ebing, Freud).
*   **Exhibitionism (露出狂):** The confession follows the classic structure of defining the pathology via a childhood initiating event—a common trope in erotic literature and early psychoanalysis seeking to explain adult fixations.

### 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

```markdown
## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **時分 (Jibun):** Used here as "the time of," indicating a past period.
*   **ゐたしてゐる (Itashite-iru):** Historical kana for している. Used in the formal expression 小便をする (to urinate).
*   **道ばた (Michibata):** Roadside/sidewalk. (Normalized to 道端).
*   **身持ち (Mimotochi):** Character, conduct, morals. Often used judgmentally regarding sexual behavior.
*   **用を足す (Yō o tasu):** Euphemism for defecating or urinating ("to take care of business").
*   **「そこ」 (Soko):** Highly common euphemism in this genre for female genitalia ("that place"). The quotation marks highlight its forbidden nature.
*   **倒錯 (Tōsaku):** Psychological perversion/deviation.
*   **パーヴァース (Pāvāsu):** Foreign loanword for "Perverse," used interchangeably with Tōsaku to suggest a sophisticated classification.

### 8️⃣ Thematic & Subtext Analysis

```markdown
## Themes & Subtext
*   **The Nexus of Shame and Desire:** The primary subtext is the thrill derived from violating social boundaries (exposing oneself publicly) while maintaining the façade of respectability (wife, child). The excitement (興奮) is intrinsically linked to the potential discovery (不安 / anxiety).
*   **Origin Story:** The childhood observation serves as a psychological anchor. The woman's act—being publicly exposed and sexually loose—becomes the foundation for the narrator's compulsion to expose *himself*.
*   **The Anxious Gaze:** The narrative emphasizes the tension between concealing the self (コートの下は裸) and desiring the gaze of "someone" (誰かが見てゐるのではないかと云ふ期待). This reflects the core voyeuristic/exhibitionistic dynamic central to *Kitan Club*'s appeal.
*   **Fetishization of Exposure:** The text implicitly suggests that the act of revealing the body, rather than coitus, is the source of ultimate satisfaction.
