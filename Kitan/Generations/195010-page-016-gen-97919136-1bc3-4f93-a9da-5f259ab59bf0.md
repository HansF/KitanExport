いんちき見世物

六尺の大いたち

これは、現在では、どんな田舎へ行つても絶対に見られないしものだが、明治末年までは、まだ残つていた。盛り場や、縁日などで鉦や太鼓をどんちやん打ち鳴らして
「そーら見たまへ、六尺あまりの大イタチ、稀代の怪獣だ、これは日光と筑波の山の間で捕れた前代未聞の大イタチそれゝゝ今が難を喰うところだ！」
しきりに怒鳴つている香具師先生。
客がその声につられて、ひよいと見ると、成程、小屋には大きな絵看板が上つている。恐ろしい形相をした大イタチが、今や将に百姓家の裏手にあらわれて、鶏を一羽喰い殺そうとしている。
それに木戸口に座つた男が揚幕の網の端を掴んでちょいゝゝとたぐる度に中が見えて、いづれその土間には怪物が絵の通りの凄味を発揮していそうに思われる。
木戸銭は二銭か三銭、あまり高くないので、つい好奇心につられてぞろゝゝと入場する。
が折角入つた見物人はあまりの事に呆然とする。と言うのは、一向イタチらしい動物も居らず、白鼠などが退屈そうに小車を廻しているではないか、
「こいつはおかしい……」
とよくゝゝ見廻わせば、すぐ足下に置いてあるのは、六尺ばかりの一枚の板である。その真ん中にべつとりと血が塗つてある――。
という馬鹿々々しいもの。
「あつ！」
と、客は思わず自分自身の間抜け加減に感心する。
「何んでえ、ベラ棒奴、六尺あまりの大板血（大いたち）……成程」
「こいつは一杯喰つちやつた！」
それでも笑いながらと、さつさと退場する。

ろくろ首

極彩色の看板を見ると、奇麗にお化粧した美女が悩ましく肘掛に凭れて居眠つている。
又その傍で、侍女らしい女がニュルル～～とまるて大蛇のような長い白首をのばして、一間も先にある行燈の油を赤い舌を出してペロゝゝと舐めている。
～と太鼓の音につれて、南無妙法蓮華経の声のやかましい縁日。
「さあー、入つて御覧。この絵の通り稀代のろくろ首だ。孫子の代まで話の種になる娘……それそれ今返事をするぞ。おーい花ちゃんや、花ちゃんやい」
小屋がけの木戸口で嗄れ声をしぼつているのは、おなじみの香具師である。すると、声に応じて中から可愛いゝ女の子の返事がある。
「あーい、あいゝゝ」
こうなると、勿論、孫も子も父も母も子供もあつたものではない。
ぞろゝゝと十銭五銭の木戸銭を払つて入場するのが安価な群衆心理である。
さてゝゝこの不思議、よくゝゝ見れば、成程場内一段と高いところにろくろ首娘が控えている。
どこをどう見ても普通の人間、少しの怪しいところもない優しい娘がにこゝゝ笑いながら、ぺんぺんゝゝべんべんゝゝ……と三味線を弾いている
「そらゝゝ、初まりゝゝ」
不意に揚げる世話人の大声に、度肝を抜かれる間もおそし、ぬるゝゝと飴細工のように、天井の方へのびてゆく不気味さ。これには全く驚かされる。確かに生きて動

六尺の大イタチ

これは、現在では、どんな田舎へ行っても絶対に見られないものだが、明治末年までは、まだ残っていた。盛り場や、縁日などで鉦（かね）や太鼓をドンドン打ち鳴らして
「そーら見たまえ、六尺（約1.8メートル）あまりの大イタチ、稀代の怪獣だ。これは日光と筑波の山の間で捕れた前代未聞の大イタチ、それそれ、今が餌を食うところだ！」
しきりに怒鳴っている香具師（やし）先生。
客がその声につられて、ひょいと見ると、なるほど、小屋には大きな絵看板が上がっている。恐ろしい形相をした大イタチが、今やまさに百姓家の裏手に現れて、鶏を一羽食い殺そうとしている。

Fake Sideshows

The Six-Shaku Great Weasel

This is, currently, even if [one] goes to any countryside, something absolutely not seen, but until the late Meiji years, it still remained. At busy quarters or festival days, etc., clanging gongs and beating drums thumping:
"Look here, look, a more than six-shaku great weasel, a rare monster! This was caught between the mountains of Nikko and Tsukuba, an unprecedented great weasel! There, there, it is now about to eat its prey!"
The showman master is constantly shouting.
Customers, lured by that voice, when [they] glance, indeed, on the shack a large painted signboard is raised. A great weasel with a terrifying countenance is now just appearing at the back of a farmer's house, about to kill and eat one chicken.
Furthermore, the man sitting at the entrance, every time [he] grabs the end of the curtain rope and pulls it a little, the inside becomes visible; eventually on that dirt floor the monster is expected to be displaying its dreadfulness just like the picture.
The entrance fee is two sen or three sen; because it is not very expensive, lured by curiosity, [people] enter in a stream.
But the spectators who went to the trouble of entering are stunned by the situation. That is to say, there is no animal that looks like a weasel at all, and white mice are boringly turning a small wheel, are they not?
"This is strange..."
When [one] looks around carefully, placed right at the feet is a single board of about six shaku. In its center, blood is thickly smeared—.
Such a ridiculous thing.
"Ah!"
The customer, without thinking, is impressed by his own degree of stupidity.
"What is this, you rascal, a six-shaku-plus 'Big Board [and] Blood' (O-ita-chi)... I see."
"I've been taken for a ride!"
Even so, while laughing, [they] quickly exit.

Rokurokubi (Long-necked Woman)

When [one] looks at the richly colored signboard, a beautifully made-up beauty is languidly leaning on an armrest, dozing.
Also beside her, a woman who looks like a maidservant, stretching a long white neck just like a giant snake for about one ken (six feet) ahead, is licking the oil of a lamp with a red tongue, lick-lick.
—Along with the sound of drums, a festival day noisy with the voice of "Namu Myoho Renge Kyo."
"Come, enter and see. Just like this picture, the rare Rokurokubi. A girl who will be a topic of conversation until the generation of grandchildren... there, there, she will answer now. Hey, Hana-chan, Hana-chan!"
The one squeezing out a hoarse voice at the shack entrance is the familiar showman. Then, in response to the voice, there is a cute girl's reply from inside.
"Yes, yes!"
When it comes to this, of course, grandchildren, children, fathers, mothers, kids, it doesn't matter who they are.
Paying the entrance fee of ten sen or five sen and entering is the cheap crowd psychology.
Now then, this wonder, if [one] looks carefully, indeed at a place one step higher in the venue, the Rokurokubi girl is waiting.
No matter where or how [one] looks, a normal human, a kind girl without a single suspicious point is smiling, pen-pen, ben-ben... playing the shamisen.
"There, starting, starting!"
In the sudden loud voice of the caretaker, before there is time to be startled, slimily like candy craft, the eeriness of [the neck] stretching toward the ceiling. By this, [one] is completely surprised. It is certainly alive and moving...

**The Pink Section**
*Gag Illustrations & Stories*

**The Great Carnival Scams**

**The Six-Foot "Great Weasel"**
These days, you won’t find this kind of thing no matter how far into the sticks you go, but up until the end of the Meiji era, these shows were still hanging on. At bustling markets and temple festivals, the air would ring with the thumping of drums and gongs as the barker shouted:
"Step right up! See the six-foot Great Weasel! A monster like you've never seen! Caught between the peaks of Nikko and Tsukuba, an unprecedented beast! Look, look! It’s about to devour its prey right now!"

Drawn in by the shouting, customers would glance up to see a massive, vivid signboard. It depicted a terrifying weasel looming behind a farmhouse, about to tear into a helpless chicken. The man at the door would occasionally tug on the curtain rope, giving passersby a fleeting glimpse of the dark interior, just enough to make them think the beast from the sign was waiting inside in all its gruesome glory. The admission was only two or three *sen*—cheap enough that curiosity usually won out, and people would file in one after another.

Once inside, however, the spectators were left speechless. There wasn’t a single thing resembling a weasel. Instead, a few white mice were lazily running on a wheel.
"Wait a minute, this isn't right..."
Looking around more closely, the customer would spot a single wooden board, exactly six feet long, lying right at their feet. Smattered across the center of it was a thick mess of blood.

It was a total sham. 
"Aha!" the customer would cry, suddenly struck by their own gullibility. 
The barker hadn’t lied—he’d just used a pun. In Japanese, "Great Weasel" (*O-itachi*) sounds exactly like "Big Board" (*O-ita*) and "Blood" (*Chi*). 
"Well, I’ll be damned! A six-foot Big-Board-Blood! They got me!" 
Even so, the mark would usually leave with a laugh, quickly making their way out.

**The Rokurokubi (The Long-Necked Woman)**
On the brightly colored signboard, a beautiful woman in heavy makeup leans languidly against an armrest, appearing to doze. Beside her, a maidservant stretches a long, white, snake-like neck out six feet to lick the oil from a lamp with a flick of her red tongue.

Amidst the thrum of drums and the chanting of prayers at the noisy festival, the barker’s gravelly voice rings out:
"Step right up and see for yourselves! The legendary Rokurokubi, just like the picture! A girl you'll be telling your grandkids about! Listen, she's about to answer... Hey, Hana-chan! Hana-chan!"
From deep inside the shack, a girl’s sweet voice chirps back, "Yes, I'm here!"
At that, everyone—grandparents, parents, and children alike—loses their common sense. Driven by that cheap thrill of the crowd, they fork over their five or ten *sen* and squeeze inside.

And what a wonder it is! There, on a raised platform, sits the Rokurokubi girl. By all appearances, she looks like a perfectly normal, lovely young lady, smiling sweetly as she plucks away at a shamisen: *pen-pen, ben-ben...*
"Alright, here we go!" the attendant suddenly bellows.
Before you can even catch your breath, her neck begins to slide upward toward the ceiling, moving with the eerie, fluid grace of pulled taffy. It’s a chilling sight that leaves the audience utterly aghast. She is, without a doubt, alive and moving...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography:** The page uses a multi-column format typical of Japanese magazines of the mid-20th century. The title "桃色セクション" (Pink Section) is enclosed in a decorative, hand-drawn red border featuring traditional cloud and floral motifs.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is at the top, followed by a smaller sub-header. The article titles are larger than the body text. The use of red ink for headers and illustrations (like the nude woman at the bottom right) is characteristic of "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines, which used limited color palettes (usually just black and red) to save on printing costs.
*   **Illustrations:** The drawing of the nude woman in a reclining pose is suggestive, fitting the "Pink Section" (erotic/entertainment) theme. The border at the top right contains "gag" sketches (suns, crosses, simple faces).
*   **Text Flow:** Traditional vertical writing (tategaki), reading from right to left.
*   **Punctuation:** Includes traditional iteration marks like "ゝ" and "々", as well as long dashes "――" for emphasis or pauses.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Magazines:** This page likely comes from a *Kasutori* magazine, a genre of cheap, pulp magazines that flourished in Japan during the immediate post-WWII years (1945–1950s). They were known for a mix of "the three S's": Sport, Screen (movies), and Sex (or "Grotesque, Nonsense, Erotic").
*   **Misemono-goya (Sideshows):** These were temporary tents set up during festivals (*ennichi*). They featured "freaks," rare animals, or illusions. As the text notes, many were "fake" (*inchiki*), relying on clever wordplay or mechanical tricks to scam customers out of a few *sen*.
*   **The "O-itachi" Pun:** This is a classic piece of Japanese folklore/humor. The barker screams "O-itachi" (Great Weasel), but the punchline is "O-ita" (Large board) + "Chi" (Blood). This specific scam is a famous trope in stories about Edo and Meiji period festivals.
*   **Rokurokubi:** A well-known *yokai* (monster) from Japanese mythology. In sideshows, this was often performed using mirrors or a hidden person's body, or sometimes "living candy" (taffy) tricks.
*   **Currency/Measurement:** The mention of *sen* (1/100 of a yen) and *shaku/ken* (traditional units of length) dates the narrative to the late Meiji (early 1900s) through the early Showa era.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **香具師 (Yashi/Tekiya):** A street stall operator or carnival barker. Historically, they sold goods or ran shows at festivals.
*   **木戸銭 (Kido-sen):** Entrance fee for a theater or sideshow.
*   **六尺 (Rokushaku):** Approximately 1.8 meters (6 feet).
*   **ベラ棒奴 (Berabō-me):** An archaic, somewhat rough Tokyo-dialect insult, similar to "You rascal!" or "What a load of nonsense!"
*   **一杯喰う (Ippai kuu):** An idiom meaning "to be tricked" or "to be taken in."
*   **南無妙法蓮華経 (Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō):** The primary chant of Nichiren Buddhism. Its mention indicates the religious atmosphere of the festival grounds where these shows were held.
*   **飴細工 (Ame-zaiku):** Traditional Japanese candy craft where hot taffy is pulled and shaped. Used here as a metaphor for the "stretching" of the neck.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Nostalgia for the "Old Japan":** The text starts by noting that these things are rarely seen anymore, positioning the story as a nostalgic look back at the late Meiji era.
*   **Gullibility and Human Nature:** The text explores "crowd psychology" (*gunshū shinri*) and how people are willing to be fooled for a small price. There is a sense of mutual agreement in the "scam"—the customers know they might be tricked, and they laugh it off when they are.
*   **The "Grotesque-Nonsense" (Ero-Guro-Nansensu):** This was a major cultural movement in pre- and post-war Japan. The combination of the beautiful girl, the monster theme, and the suggestive nude illustration is a classic example of this aesthetic.
