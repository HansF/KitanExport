んだ。へへ。そあの、おまえさんの、その、なんだ、へへ」
この強盗、愛嬌たっぷりです。
「一体なにが欲しいの。じらさないでよ。」
「へへやっぱり、あつしに。言わす氣かい。」
「ますます変ねえ。命以外なら、なんでも差し上げてよ。早くしてよ。」
「へへ。実はなあ、その、お前さんがはいているズロースが欲しいのだ。」
「ホホホ……」
その御婦人、思わず吹き出してしまった。
相手が痴漢（？）と分ると、
さすがは、年増女落ち着いたものです。まことに、あっぱれと言いたい。
この点、年増女と云うものは、殿方よりもはるかに度胸が坐っている。
「ホホ……。変なもの又御所望なのねホホ……。」
「そのホホ……が気に喰わねえ、もつと小さく笑え。」
これぢゃ、今までと形勢が違う。
「あんた色気違いなのね。」
「バカ、俺らはなあ、神様に願かけて千枚集めることにしてるんだ。千枚集めたら、どんな願いでも、神様はかなえて下さるんだ。」
「とんだ神様もあったものね。初耳だわ。」
「やかましい。」
「そんなに怒る事なんかないわ。で、今までに一体何枚位集まつたの。さぞ色とりどり、澤山集まったでしょ。」
「今夜が開業したてだ。」
「そう、道理であんた、いやに恥しそうにもじもじしてると思つたわ。新米なのね」
「ぐづぐづ言わずに早くしろ世話のやける女だ。あんまり、この俺を甘く見やがると承知しねえぞ。」
「ハイ、ハイ、でも嫌あねえ、何んだか。――あつ、そうそう困まつたわ。」
「何が困まつたんだ。困まることなんざあねえぢゃないか。」
「それが大ありなのよ。あのねえ、今の汚れているから、ねえ、あたしの家へいらっしゃいよ。新らしい洗濯したての。いくらでも上げるから、ね！それでいいでしょ、」
「おつと、その垢つきのでいゝんだ。それでなくちゃいけねえんだ。新らしいのでは、神様が喜ばれねえんだ。そんな所まで出張して来ねえ、デパートか、洋品店に行けばいくらでも貰えるわいさあ、早くしろ、俺あこう見えても、気が短いんだ」
その御婦人は、はたと当惑そうな顔をして、強盗の顔をまじまじと見つめました。
「やいやい、そう人の顔をじろじろ見るない。人が来ない中に早くするんだ。」
強盗が、いらいらとあせり出しているのが手にとるように分かります。
「おめえ、まさか、嫌だつて言うんぢゃあるめえな。おめえがもし其気なら腕づくでも取つて見せるがいゝか。」
「あたしはまだ、嫌だとは言つてないわ。」
「そんなら。」
「ねえ、強盗さん」
その御婦人、何思つたかあまえるように、そう言って強盗にしなだれかかつて行きました。
強盗、ぶるぶるつとからだを震わし、思わず後へよろめいて、
「おい、一体何するんだ。それに、強盗さんに、強盗さんつてあまり心安く言うな。」
その御婦人そんなことに一向頓着なく、やがて思い切つたように、
「ねえ、強盗さん、こうなつたら仕方がないからもう何もかも言つてしまうわ。あのねえ、でも恥しいわ――あのねえ、あたし今、本当のことを言うと何もはいていないのよ。嘘だと思つたら、見せて上げてもいゝのよ。だつてあたし今、山へ松茸狩りに行つてその帰りなんですもの。」
これには、さすがの強盗君も眼を白黒させて、
「ギョ、ギョッ！！」

その婦人は、はたと当惑そうな顔をして、強盗の顔をまじまじと見つめました。
「やいやい、そう人の顔をじろじろ見るな。人が来ないうちに早くするんだ。」
強盗が、いらいらと焦り出しているのが手に取るようにわかります。

強盗、ぶるぶるっと体を震わし、思わず後ろへよろめいて、
「おい、一体何するんだ。それに、強盗さんに、強盗さんってあまり心安く言うな。」
その婦人そんなことに一向頓着なく、やがて思い切ったように、
「ねえ、強盗さん、こうなったら仕方がないからもう何もかも言ってしまうわ。あのねえ、でも恥ずかしいわ――あのねえ、あたし今、本当のことを言うと何も穿いていないのよ。嘘だと思ったら、見せてあげてもいいのよ。だってあたし今、山へ松茸狩りに行ってその帰りなんですもの。」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"It is. Hehe. That, um, yours, that, what is it, hehe."
This burglar, charm is plenty.
"Exactly what [do you] want? Don't tease me."
"Hehe, after all, to me [you] make [me] say it?"
"Increasingly strange. If [it is] other than life, anything [I will] give. Do [it] quickly."
"Hehe. Truth is, um, that which you are wearing, drawers, [I] want."
"Ho-ho-ho..."
That lady, unintentionally burst out laughing.
Partner is a pervert (?), once understood,
As expected of an older woman, [she is] composed. Truly, "bravo" [I] want to say.
On this point, things called older women, than gentlemen, by far, [their] guts are sitting (steady).
"Ho-ho... Strange thing again [you] desire, ho-ho..."
"That 'ho-ho' does not eat my feeling (displeases me), laugh more small."
This way, until now and the situation is different.
"You are a sex-crazed person, aren't you."
"Idiot, we, see, to God made a vow, one thousand pieces [I] decided to collect. If one thousand are collected, any wish, God will grant."
"A terrible God there was. First time [I] hear [it]."
"Noisy!"
"Such getting angry thing is not. So, until now, exactly how many pieces collected? Surely colorful, many gathered, right?"
"Tonight is just opened for business."
"So, reason you, awfully embarrassedly fidgeting [I] thought. [You] are a novice, aren't you."
"Without grumbling do [it] quickly, woman who burns care (troublesome). Too much, if [you] look sweetly at me (underestimate), [I] won't permit [it]."
"Yes, yes, but unpleasant, somehow. --Ah, right, right, [I am] troubled."
"What is troubled? There is no troubled thing, is there?"
"That is big existence. You see, now [they] are dirty, so, hey, to my house come. New, freshly washed [ones]. As many as [you want I] will give, hey! With that [it] is good, right?"
"Whoa, those with grime are good. Unless [it is] that, [it] won't do. With new ones, God won't be pleased. To such a place [I] don't come on business, if [I] go to department store or western goods shop, [I] can buy as many as [I want], hey, hurry up, even though [I] look like this, temper is short."
That lady, suddenly with a puzzled face, looked intently at the burglar's face.
"Hey, hey, don't stare at a person's face like that. While people don't come, do [it] quickly."
Burglar, irritably beginning to panic, is understood like taking in hand.
"You, surely, won't say [you] dislike [it]. If you are in that mood, even by force [I will] take [them] and show [you], okay?"
"I haven't said [I] dislike [it] yet."
"Then."
"Hey, Mr. Burglar."
That lady, thinking what [unknown], as if acting sweet, saying so, leaned toward the burglar.
Burglar, shivering body, unintentionally staggered backward,
"Hey, exactly what are [you] doing? Besides, 'Mr. Burglar,' 'Mr. Burglar,' don't say so familiarly."
That lady to such things not at all caring, eventually as if decided,
"Hey, Mr. Burglar, since [it] has come to this, [it] can't be helped so [I] will say everything. You see, but [it is] embarrassing-- you see, I now, to tell the truth, am wearing nothing. If [you] think [it is] a lie, [I] can even show [you]. Because I now, to the mountain for matsutake mushroom hunting went and am on the way back."
At this, even the esteemed Mr. Burglar, eyes black and white (startled),
"Gyo, Gyoh!!"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Uh, yeah. Hehe. Well, you see... yours... that thing... you know... hehe."
This burglar was certainly a charming character.
"What on earth do you want? Don't keep me in suspense."
"Hehe... you're really going to make me say it out loud, aren't you?"
"How very strange. As long as it's not my life, I'll give you whatever you want. Just get on with it."
"Hehe. To tell you the truth... well, I want those drawers you're wearing."
"Ho, ho, ho...!"
The lady couldn't help but burst into laughter. Once she realized her assailant was merely a fetishist (?), she became remarkably composed—as expected of a woman of her years. Truly, one has to admire her. In this regard, a mature woman has far more backbone than any man.
"Ho, ho... what a peculiar thing to request, ho, ho...!"
"Quit that 'ho-ho' laughing! I don't like it. Laugh more quietly!"
The tables had turned completely.
"You're just a sex-obsessed pervert, aren't you?"
"Shut up! I've made a vow to the gods to collect a thousand pairs. They say if you gather a thousand, the gods will grant any wish you have!"
"What a ridiculous god that must be. That's a new one on me."
"Quiet!"
"There's no need to get so angry. So, how many have you collected so far? I imagine you have a colorful assortment by now."
"Tonight's my first night in business!"
"Ah, that explains it. I thought you seemed awfully fidgety and embarrassed. You're a total novice, aren't you?"
"Stop your yammering and hurry up! You're a real piece of work. Don't you dare underestimate me, or you'll regret it!"
"Fine, fine. But really, this is so unpleasant. Oh! Wait, I just realized I have a problem."
"What problem? There shouldn't be any problem at all!"
"Oh, but there is. You see, the ones I have on now are dirty. Why don't you come back to my house? I've got plenty of fresh, newly laundered ones I can give you. How about that?"
"No way! The ones with the 'grime' are exactly what I need! It has to be those. The gods won't be happy with new ones. If I wanted new ones, I wouldn't have to come out on a job like this; I could buy as many as I wanted at a department store or a clothing shop. Now hurry up! I may not look it, but I’ve got a short fuse!"
The lady suddenly looked perplexed and stared intently at the burglar's face.
"Hey! Stop staring at me! Just do it before someone comes along!"
The burglar was clearly becoming frantic with impatience.
"You... you aren't going to say no, are you? Because if you are, I'm perfectly happy to take them by force!"
"I never said I wouldn't give them to you."
"Well then!"
"Oh, Mr. Burglar..."
The lady, for some reason, began to act coquettishly, leaning her body toward him as she spoke. The burglar began to tremble and staggered back in surprise.
"Hey! What do you think you're doing? And don't call me 'Mr. Burglar' so familiarly!"
Ignoring him completely, the woman finally seemed to make a bold decision.
"Listen, Mr. Burglar, since it's come to this, I might as well tell you everything. It's so embarrassing, but... the truth is, I'm not wearing anything at all right now. If you don't believe me, I'm happy to show you. You see, I've just come back from mushroom hunting in the mountains!"
At this revelation, even the burglar's eyes popped out in shock.
"Gack! Wha—?!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in three vertical columns, typical of Japanese magazine formatting. It reads from top-to-bottom and right-to-left.
*   **Typography:** Uses standard *Mincho* style typeface common in mid-century printing. The punctuation includes heavy use of quotation marks 「」 and ellipses …… to denote dialogue and pauses.
*   **Illustration:** A simple, somewhat crude line-art caricature is placed in the lower-left. It depicts a scrawny, surprised-looking man (the burglar) and a woman in a slip or undergarment (the "lady"). The style is reminiscent of *manga-e* or satirical sketches from the 1950s.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The dialogue is the primary focus. There is no large title on this specific page, suggesting it is a continuation of a story or a single entry in a collection of short humorous anecdotes (*kobana*).
*   **Pagination:** The page number "-45-" is centered at the bottom, framed by decorative flourishes.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** This likely dates from the late 1940s to the 1950s (Early Post-war Showa). The paper quality, font, and the specific term "Drawers" (ズロース) point to this era.
*   **Social Context:** The story plays on the "ero-guro-nansensu" (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) tradition that flourished in pulp magazines. These magazines often featured "weak" men being outwitted by "strong" or "worldly" women.
*   **The "1,000 Pieces" Trope:** The burglar's claim that collecting 1,000 pieces of underwear will grant a wish is a parody of *Senbazuru* (1,000 origami cranes), a traditional practice for making a wish or seeking healing.
*   **Matsutake Mushroom Hunting (松茸狩り):** In the context of "adult" humor of this period, "matsutake hunting" was frequently used as a double entendre for sexual activity or a reason for being disheveled/undressed in the woods. The joke here is that she is undressed because she was "hunting," which leaves the burglar (who specifically wanted the "used" garment for his ritual) empty-handed and shocked.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ズロース (Zurōsu):** From English "drawers." A mid-20th-century term for women's loose-fitting underpants/knickers. Now considered archaic (replaced by *pantsu* or *shōtsu*).
*   **年増女 (Toshima-onna):** A mature or middle-aged woman. In this context, it implies she is sexually experienced and not easily frightened by a clumsy pervert.
*   **あっぱれ (Appare):** Splendid, admirable, bravo.
*   **度胸が坐っている (Dokyō ga suwatte iru):** To have nerves of steel; to be unshakable.
*   **色気違い (Iro-kichigai):** A "sex-crazy" person or a pervert. *Kichigai* is a strong term (now considered a slur in many contexts) meaning "crazy."
*   **垢つき (Akatsuki):** Literally "with grime" or "soiled." The burglar specifies he wants "used" garments, which highlights the fetishistic nature of his "religious vow."
*   **眼を白黒させる (Me o shirokuro saseru):** An idiom meaning to be startled, confused, or to have one's eyes roll in surprise.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Subversion of Power:** The "victim" (the lady) completely dominates the "attacker" (the burglar). Her calm, mocking "Ho-ho-ho" laugh disarms him.
*   **The Bumbling Criminal:** The burglar is not a professional but a "novice" (新米 - *shinmai*) driven by an absurd, superstitious ritual rather than greed.
*   **The Absurdity of Ritual:** The idea of a "sacred vow" involving stolen underwear mocks traditional religious piety.
*   **Erotic Comedy:** The humor relies on the tension between a sexual request and the mundane, almost business-like negotiation that follows, ending in a punchline about being naked.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Humorous Short Story (Kobana), Pulp Fiction.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Comedy, Satire, Erotica (soft), Showa Era, Gender Roles, Absurdism.
*   **Classification:** Adult-oriented humor.
