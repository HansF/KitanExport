## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

多にない。
　日本人の目にはどう見てもシベリヤの彼女達に貞操観念があるとは見えなかつた。
「享樂するのも男女同權よ」
「自分一人でなく、お互いに楽しいのだから此れ位良い事はないでしよう」と言いつつぱつたり道で会つた名も知らぬ男に体をあたえる彼女達である。
　彼女達は本能のまゝに、赤裸々に進んで行く。アダムとイヴの樂園は眞書の草原に、馬車の乾草の上に倉庫の中に廢坑の中に、いたる所に演じられ吾々を刺戟した。
　此の様に彼女達は戦争で男を失い、何よりも生活において一番男に不自由して居た。
　腕の良いハンサム、ボーイなどは十人の女を持ち、女もそれなりに生活してゐるのを知りつつ十日目毎の快樂を樂しみに生活してゐるのだ。だから勇敢な日本人は彼女の腕の中に飛び込んで行つたが結局初めの内のみでうまく行かなかつた、と言うのは日本人にはとてもソ連の男の様な愛撫動作が出来ないのだつた。日本人はどこ迄も暴君的で女の心も考えずに、さつ〜と自分だけ滿足すると終つてしまうが、ソ連の男は我々から考えると何かねち〜してじれつたく感じる程であるが、それだけ日本人は劣つて居るのであつて、とても、ソ連の男達と太刀打ちすることは、淡白な日本人には出来ない。
　此の性慾をシベリヤではとんでもない事に利用して居るそれは或日一緒に働く女囚人がよく働くので「よく働きますね」と尋ねると
「一生懸命働けば男の囚人の所へ慰問に行けますからね、もう六月から男なしで……。もし妊娠でもすれば仕事は休めて、おいしい物は食べれるし、子供が生まれればスターリンの子だというので國家が育てゝくれますから」
　何と言うソ連的やりかたであろう。「性慾を餌に。」日本人のなかにもこれにつられてゲペウのスパイになつた者が居るのである。
　たまに飲んだ強いウオツカーにいい氣持になつた時、ドアが開いて全裸の美女が入つてきて、今流行のストリップショーを演じる。ゲペウはにやり〜と日本人の顔を見つゝ「どうです、あの女、白い豊かな腰、股、大きな乳房、あの女を抱きたいと思わないですか私の言つた事を明けばあの女を抱く事も美味しい食物も煙草にも不自由しないですよ。」
　と言いつつ日本人の眼の動きで脈がありそうだと見るや、その美女に合図をすると女は日本人の横にぴつたり体をつけ腰掛け酒をすゝめ、肩に手をまわし、頬をすりつけ挑発してくるや、殆んどの日本人は、ふら〜と夢の中に署名してしまうのである。此のスパイの為現にシベリヤの野に苦しむ同胞が数多く居るのである。
　女は大小の差こそあれ、誰も露出症的傾向があるがシベリヤの女は時にひどい様である。
　シベリヤの田舎には未だノースロースの女が相當居る。その女達の牛の乳を搾る姿に、久米仙人になつてとんでもない怪我をした日本人も居る。とにかく男と言うものは誰しも、ストリップショーを見ても、その月はある一点に集中するものである。
　私の働いて居た工場の便所は戸がこわれてなくなつてしまつて居た。或日私が用をたして居ると工場の若い女事務員がやつて来て、私が居るのを見るや、一寸赤くなりつつ、私の真正面の便所に立ち、にやつと笑いかけつつ、スカートをめくつて、私の方をじつと睨みつゝ用をたしだしたのには、流石の私もめんくらつてしまつた。中には惡戯半分日本人に近づいて「スマトリ（見て見ろ）」と言いつつパツとスカートをめくる女達も居た。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Not many. In the eyes of Japanese, no matter how viewed, in those Siberian women, a sense of chastity existing did not appear. "To enjoy is also equal rights for men and women," "Not just myself alone, because it is mutually pleasant, there is no better thing than this," while saying, suddenly meeting on the road a man whose name is not known, giving their bodies they are, those women. They, according to instinct, nakedly proceed. Adam and Eve's paradise, in the midday prairie, on top of the carriage's hay, inside warehouses, inside abandoned mines, everywhere played out and stimulated us. In this way, those women lost men in the war, and more than anything in life, were most inconvenienced by [lack of] men. A good-skilled handsome boy and such had ten women, and women while knowing he lived like that, for the pleasure of every tenth day lived. Therefore brave Japanese jumped into her arms, but in the end, only at the beginning and did not go well. That is to say, for Japanese, very much like Soviet men's caressing actions could not be done. Japanese are to the end tyrannical, without considering woman's heart, quickly satisfying only themselves and ending, but Soviet men from our perspective are something sticky and to the extent of feeling impatient, but by that much Japanese are inferior, and very much, to compete with Soviet men, for the frank/plain Japanese, is not possible.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Siberian Frivolous Scenes: Two Tales**
By Takeshi Anabuki

There were few of them. To the eyes of any Japanese observer, it was impossible to see the women of Siberia as having any sense of chastity. They were the kind of women who would give their bodies to a nameless man they just happened to meet on the road, saying things like, "Enjoyment is a matter of equal rights," or "Since it’s fun for both of us, what could be wrong with it?"

They lived nakedly, following their instincts. Paradises of Adam and Eve played out everywhere—in the midday prairies, atop the hay in wagons, inside warehouses, and in abandoned mines—constantly stimulating us. Having lost so many men to the war, these women were more desperate for male companionship than for anything else in life. A handsome, capable fellow might have ten women; the women, knowing this, would live for the pleasure of their turn once every ten days. Consequently, many "brave" Japanese men threw themselves into the arms of these women, but in the end, it only went well at the very beginning. The truth is, Japanese men were simply incapable of the kind of elaborate foreplay Soviet men practiced. Japanese men are inherently tyrannical; they satisfy themselves quickly without a thought for the woman's feelings and then it's over. Soviet men, by contrast, seemed almost tediously persistent to us, yet in that regard, we Japanese were inferior. The "plain" Japanese man was simply no match for the Soviet.

In Siberia, this sexual desire was exploited in horrific ways. One day, I noticed a female prisoner working particularly hard and asked her why. She replied, "If I work hard, I'm allowed to visit the male prisoners for 'consolation.' It's been six months without a man... If I get pregnant, I can take a break from work and eat good food. And if a child is born, they say it’s 'Stalin’s child,' so the state raises it for me."

What a uniquely Soviet system—using sex as bait. Even among the Japanese, some were lured by this and became spies for the GPU. Occasionally, when a man was feeling good after some strong vodka, the door would open and a beautiful, naked woman would enter to perform a striptease, which was popular then. The GPU agent would smirk while watching the Japanese man's face, whispering, "How about her? Those white, ample hips, those thighs, those large breasts. Don't you want to hold her? If you tell me what I want to know, you can have her, plus good food and tobacco."

If the agent saw a glimmer of interest in the man's eyes, he would signal the woman. She would press her body against the Japanese man, offer him a drink, put her arm around his shoulder, and rub her cheek against his. Most Japanese men, lured into a daze, would find themselves signing the papers. Because of these spies, many of our compatriots are suffering in the Siberian wilds to this day.

While all women may have some exhibitionist tendencies, it seemed particularly extreme in Siberian women. In the countryside, there are still many women who go "north-south" (without underwear). Seeing them milking cows, some Japanese men were so distracted—like the legendary Kume the Immortal—that they suffered terrible accidents. In any case, when a man sees a striptease, his eyes tend to focus on a certain point.

The toilet in the factory where I worked had no door. One day, while I was using it, a young female clerk came in. Seeing me, she blushed slightly but stood in the toilet directly opposite me. Grinning, she lifted her skirt and relieved herself while staring right at me. I was utterly flabbergasted. Some women would even approach Japanese men jokingly, shouting "Smatri! (Look!)" before suddenly hiking up their skirts.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This is a single-page layout from a post-war Japanese magazine. The text is arranged in vertical columns (read right-to-left).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "シベリヤ軟派風景 二題" (Siberian Frivolous Scenery: Two Topics) and the author "穴吹 武" (Anabuki Takeshi) are placed in a central box on the right side, though the text flows around it. This suggests a feature article or a memoir section.
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing of a woman in a slip or lingerie occupies the lower-left portion of the page. It is suggestive but fits the "Kasu-tori" (pulp) magazine aesthetic of the era, which often blended reportage with eroticism.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-20th-century printing. The use of small characters for repetition (like 〜) and specific punctuation (brackets for dialogue) is standard.
*   **Page Number:** A small "(95)" at the bottom indicates its position in a larger publication.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Siberian Internment (Siberia Yokuryu):** Following Japan's surrender in 1945, hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers and civilians were captured by the Soviet Union and sent to labor camps in Siberia. This text reflects the perspective of a former internee.
*   **Kasu-tori Culture:** In the immediate post-war years, Japan saw a boom in "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, pulp publications that focused on "grotesque, nonsense, and erotic" (ero-guro-nansensu) themes, often featuring true-life accounts of the war and internment that were previously censored.
*   **GPU (Gue-Pee-U):** Refers to the Soviet secret police (State Political Directorate). The text highlights the use of "honey traps" to recruit informants among Japanese POWs.
*   **Kume the Immortal (Kume-no-Sennin):** A reference to a Japanese legend about a mountain ascetic who lost his supernatural powers of flight because he was distracted by the sight of a beautiful woman's white legs as she washed clothes in a river.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The text portrays Soviet women as sexually liberated or "primitive" compared to the more conservative (at the time) Japanese standards of "chastity" (teiso). It also notes the demographic shift in the USSR where war casualties left a significant surplus of women.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **軟派 (Nanpa):** Today this means "flirting" or "picking up girls," but in this context, it refers to "soft" or "frivolous/scandalous" subject matter, as opposed to "hard" political or military reporting.
*   **貞操観念 (Teiso Kannen):** Sense of chastity/virtue.
*   **劣情 (Retsujo):** Sexual desire or "base passions" (implied in the context of "inferior" Japanese performance).
*   **ねちねち (Nechi-nechi):** Persistent, sticky, or slow. Used here to describe the Soviet style of "caressing" which the author finds tedious compared to the "tyrannical" and quick Japanese style.
*   **慰問 (Imon):** "Consolation" or "visit." In wartime/prison contexts, it often refers to organized visits to provide comfort, here explicitly used for sexual encounters.
*   **ノー・スロース (No-surousu):** A phonetic rendering of "No Slacks" or "No Drawers," a period slang for not wearing underwear.
*   **スマトリ (Sumatori):** From the Russian "Смотри" (Smotri), meaning "Look!"

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Culture Shock:** The primary theme is the shock of encountering a society with vastly different sexual and social norms. The author characterizes Soviet women as lacking "chastity" but acknowledges this stems from a different ideology (gender equality) and the desperation of post-war life.
*   **Japanese Masculinity in Crisis:** There is a recurring subtext of Japanese male inferiority—both in terms of sexual "technique" (compared to Soviet men) and vulnerability to "honey traps." The author describes Japanese men as "tyrannical" and "plain," suggesting a lack of sophistication in romance.
*   **Anti-Soviet Sentiment:** Despite the "frivolous" tone, there is a sharp criticism of the Soviet state. The idea of "Stalin's child" (children raised by the state so mothers can work/breed) and the use of sex as a tool for espionage are framed as dehumanizing.
*   **The Male Gaze:** The text is heavily filtered through a voyeuristic male gaze, common in the Kasu-tori genre, where the hardships of internment are juxtaposed with erotic anecdotes.
