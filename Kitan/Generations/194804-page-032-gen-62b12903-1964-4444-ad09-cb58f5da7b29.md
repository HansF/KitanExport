子と詩子がすぐ客を迎えてボックスへ送ると
「あら、トランプが當つた。詩子さんおどろなさいよ」
とマダムの聲が追つて来る。
「マダム、何かあつたの？」
「あのね、今日は雨でお店も閑だし、今夜のような日に佐崎さんが来て下さつたら、一度裏の家へ案内して素肌を見せてあげてもいいつて、今詩子さんが本音を吐いていた所だつたのよ」
「へー、それは本當かい？ 詩子さんが僕と一緒に寝てくれるつて？ それが本当なら僕は河原町一の幸福者つて事になるんだが、詩子ちやん、本當？」
「相變らずお口のうまい、そんな事はもつと後の話、とにかく飲みましよう。何か食べる？ ビフテキどう？ 富子さんと三人分註文していいでしよ」
佐崎はこの戰時にすつかり御機嫌になつてすぐ運ばれて来た酒で祝盃をあげにかかつた。
「この人新しい人だね、何て人？」
「浮気？」
「そうぢやないよ、可愛い顔してるから聞きたくなつたのさ」
「今日は少し飲んで来たのね、この人トミ子さん、昨日来たばかりなの。こんなお勤めは始めてだから亂暴なすつちや駄目よ。さ、もう一杯おあけなさいよ」
又二、三入客が入つて来て、次の受付の女給が立つて行き、店は段々青春を取戻して来た。
「この邊は停電しないのか？」
「うん、お拂いが悪いから半時間毎に點いたり消えたりする。でもこゝは蓄電池で辛うじて營業續行よ。お客さんは暗い方がいいんでしよ。今夜何所で飲んでらしたの？」
「角のホルモン焼き、實は今夜こゝで待合する約束があるんだよ。小さい頃の友達が今度復員して来たので久し振りの乾盃をあげるんだ。僕が美人の店を紹介するとゆうので、七時に此所へ来る事になつてるんだよ。凄く男前だぜ、上原謙みたいな奴だ。詩子さんなら一見で惚れやしないかと心配だよ」
「妾、そんな女に見える？」
「怒つた？」
「うん」
「ちやあ君の純情の印に、さつきの話、本當に僕とつき合つてくれる？」
詩子は今迄にない稚初々した表情で、一寸眼の際を染め乍ら小さく頷いた。
「後でね、八時になつたら二階へ行きましよう。それまでに妾だつて少しは酔わなきやきまりが悪いんですもの、お酒註文していいでしよ」
その時突然電燈が消えた。誰かが嫌やワ、又停電いわと、叫んでいる。蓄電池が點くまでの僅かの間に、佐崎は隣の詩子の膝の間深く手を差込んでいた。ギクンと觸れた温い太腿、さすがの不意打に彼女は着物を押えて、
「アラ！ 後でーー」

Shigeko and another girl quickly greeted the customers and showed them to a booth. 
"Oh, look! The cards were right. Shigeko, you're in for a surprise!" the Madame’s voice called out after them.
"Madame, what happened?"
"Well, you see, business is slow because of the rain. Shigeko was just saying that if Mr. Sasaki showed up on a night like this, she’d take him back to her private quarters and show him a bit of her bare skin."
"Heh, is that so? Shigeko, you’d really sleep with me? If that’s true, I’d be the luckiest man in Kawaramachi. Is it true, Shigeko-chan?"
"Smooth-talking as always. We can talk about that later; for now, let’s drink. Do you want something to eat? How about some beefsteak? I’ll order three portions, for us and Tomiko-san, alright?"
Sasaki, in high spirits despite the wartime (or post-war) atmosphere, immediately started drinking a celebratory toast with the sake that had just been brought.
"Is she new? What’s her name?"
"Are you being fickle?" 
"No, she just has such a cute face I had to ask."
"You've already had a few, haven't you? This is Tomiko-san; she only started yesterday. It’s her first time in this line of work, so don't you go being rough with her. Here, have another drink."
Two or three more customers arrived, and the next waitress at the door went to greet them. The shop was gradually regaining its lively, youthful atmosphere.
"Don't you get blackouts around here?"
"Yeah, we haven't paid enough, so the lights flicker off every half hour. But we’ve got storage batteries here, so we can barely keep the business running. Besides, customers prefer it dark, don't they? Where were you drinking tonight?"
"At the hormone-yaki place on the corner. Actually, I’m supposed to meet someone here tonight. An old childhood friend just got demobilized, so we’re going to have a long-overdue drink. I told him I’d show him a shop with beautiful women, so he’s supposed to be here at seven. He’s a real looker—looks like Uehara Ken. I’m worried you’ll fall for him at first sight, Shigeko."
"Do I look like that kind of woman to you?"
"Are you mad?"
"Yes."
"Then as a sign of your devotion, will you really go through with what you said earlier?"
With an uncharacteristically innocent expression, Shigeko gave a small nod, her eyes moistening slightly.
"Later, okay? Let’s go upstairs at eight. I need to get a little tipsy first, otherwise it’ll be awkward. I can order more sake, right?"
Just then, the lights suddenly went out. Someone cried out, "Oh no, another blackout!" In the brief moment before the battery power kicked in, Sasaki slid his hand deep between Shigeko’s knees. Startled by the touch of her warm thigh, she clutched at her kimono. 
"Oh! Not yet—later..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography:** The text uses a traditional vertical layout (*tategaki*), reading right to left. It employs a mix of kanji and hiragana with some katakana for loanwords. Notably, it uses some older kanji forms (kyūjitai) like 「當」 for 「当」 and 「聲」 for 「声」, and 「醉」 for 「酔」, which were common until the late 1940s/early 1950s script reforms.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page is divided into a text block at the top and two illustrations at the bottom. The illustrations serve to visualize the characters and the "club" atmosphere.
*   **Illustration Style:** The drawings are reminiscent of early post-war manga or magazine illustrations, focusing on expressive faces and westernized fashion (men in suits/hats, women with permed hair).
*   **Formatting:** Small circle marks (bullets) appear at the start of some paragraphs, a common stylistic choice in magazines to denote a change in speaker or scene.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "32" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is part of a longer serial or a collection of short stories.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Setting:** The mention of "demobilization" (*fukuin*) and "blackouts" (*teiden*) strongly suggests the immediate post-war period (late 1940s). Soldiers were returning home, and Japan's infrastructure was in shambles, leading to frequent power shortages.
*   **Kawaracho (河原町):** This is a famous district in Kyoto, known then and now for its nightlife, bars, and restaurants.
*   **Uehara Ken (上原謙):** A famous Japanese film star of the era, known for his "handsome" looks. Referencing him was a way to denote a man was exceptionally attractive.
*   **Hospitality Culture:** The "Madame" and "waitresses" (*jokyū*) represent the *fuzoku* (entertainment/nightlife) culture of the era. The dialogue hints at the blurring lines between a hostess's company and prostitution, which was common in certain types of "cafes" or "clubs" during this period.
*   **Food Items:** "Beefsteak" (*bifuteki*) and "Hormone-yaki" (grilled offal) represent different social strata of dining. Beefsteak was a luxury, while hormone-yaki was cheap, hearty food popularized by the black markets post-war.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ボックス (Box):** Refers to a booth or a partitioned seating area in a bar or restaurant.
*   **マダム (Madame):** The female owner or manager of a bar or club.
*   **本音を吐く (Honne o haku):** To speak one's true feelings or intentions.
*   **河原町一 (Kawaracho-ichi):** The best in Kawaramachi.
*   **復員 (Fukuin):** Demobilization; the return of soldiers from overseas after WWII.
*   **蓄電池 (Chikudenchi):** Storage batteries, used here as a backup power source during blackouts.
*   **お勤め (O-tsutome):** A euphemism for working in the nightlife/entertainment industry.
*   **ギクン (Gikun):** An onomatopoeia for a sudden start or jolt of surprise.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Survival and Hedonism:** In the wake of war, the characters seek escape through alcohol, food (beefsteak), and physical intimacy.
*   **Transactional Romance:** The dialogue between Sasaki and Shigeko oscillates between genuine affection and a professional transaction. Shigeko uses the promise of intimacy to encourage Sasaki to order more expensive items like beefsteak and sake.
*   **The "New Girl" Trope:** Introducing "Tomiko" as a "new, innocent" girl is a classic strategy in hostess bars to pique the interest of regular customers and evoke a protective (or predatory) instinct.
*   **Fragility of Life:** The constant blackouts serve as a metaphor for the unstable, "flickering" nature of life in post-war Japan.
