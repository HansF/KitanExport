### お加代源三郎日記 20

二人は身に めえ酒を飲むという寸法さあ。
そのひとり言を聞いてお加代も呆れた。
「世の中にや悪党は沢山居るけど、坊主の
くせにこんなひどいことをするなんて、
うわべが違ふもんねえ。」
と、感心する。

#### 六

と心の中で叫んだ。
破れ畳に転がされてゐるのは腰巻一つの女。
うしろ手にギリギリ縛られて息も絶えだえ。
そのそばに、貪欲利己から酒をくみながら二
タニタ笑ってゐるのは、この寺の住職らしい
坊主頭の大男。
「ウフフフ、どんな急ぎの用事は知ら
ねえが、こんな田舎を女一人旅とは無茶な話
だぜ。おかげでこの仙海も久し振りに女ッ気
にありつけるといふもんだ。たっぶり楽ちん
だぞ。そのあとで、宿場女郎に叩き売り、またう

## Literal English Translation

The two of us are the measure of those who drink hidden sake within their bodies, you see.
Listening to that monologue, Okage was also appalled.
"There are many villains in the world, but for a priest,
to do something so terrible,
their facade is different, isn't it?"
Thus, she was impressed.

#### Six

And I cried out in my heart.
The woman rolling on the torn tatami was wearing only a loincloth.
Her hands were tied tightly behind her back, barely breathing.
Beside her, drinking sake out of greed and self-interest, laughing wide-mouthedly (*nitani-ta*), was the massive, bald-headed man who appeared to be the head priest of this temple.
"Ufufufu, I don't know what urgent business
she had, but traveling alone, a woman, in such a countryside place, is reckless.
Thanks to her, this Saneumi has had a chance to get some female energy (*onnakke*) after a long time. It's truly delightful.
After this, I'll beat and sell her off to a post town prostitute, and then also...

\[*Right margin note / Caption*\]
...when we saw the scene
unfolding
in the light of the dark
candle,
even the composed
Okage
unintentionally
cried out
"Ah!"
in her heart.

#### Seven

"Okage, what on earth
do you think this guy is?"
"Well now, let's watch the situation a little longer."
Okage peered inside, relaxed and seeming entertained.
The monk Saneumi, after tying the agonizing woman to a pillar,
finally stripped off her last remaining garment.

#### Eight

(He did so.) He let out a great sigh, "Bū—!"
"Ah, this is a superb view. The way the rope bites into the skin,
and the white flesh bulges out—
that is perfect for a sake accompaniment (*sakana*)."
The woman was raising shrieks and moans (*hiihī*) from the back of her throat,
but her voice was already too hoarse to be heard.
Saneumi, having tired of the pillar bondage,
next bound her hands behind her again and hung her from the ceiling.
While she was hanging open, he began to beat her ample buttocks
with a split bamboo stick (*waretake*), *bishi-bishiri*. A dull sound resonated,
and her skin twitched and quivered.
Just as a cat toys with a mouse, Saneumi the monk
was enjoying tying up one woman, untying her,
and then tying her up again and untying her.

#### Nine

Saneumi bound the woman's four limbs together into one. Just like...

## Literary English Translation

The pair of us felt we were truly of the type who partake of hidden liquor in the flesh.
Hearing his soliloquy, even Okage was taken aback.
"There are plenty of villains in the world, but for a priest
to do such a terrible thing—
the hypocrisy is astounding."
She spoke, captivated.

#### Six

I cried out in my heart.
Lying on the torn tatami was a woman clad only in a loincloth.
Her hands were bound tightly behind her, and she was barely breathing.
Beside her, drinking sake greedily and selfishly, laughing with a broad, gap-toothed grin, was the huge, bald-headed man who seemed to be the abbot of this temple.
"Ufufufu. I don't know what urgent business
she had, but for a woman to travel alone in this remote countryside is reckless.
Thanks to her, this Saneumi has finally been able to enjoy some female company after a long drought. It's a marvelous, relaxed pleasure.
After this, I'll beat her and sell her off to a post-town brothel, and then...

\[*Right margin note / Caption*\]
...When we witnessed
the scene unfolding
in the glow of the dark
candlelight,
even the level-headed
Okage
involuntarily
cried out,
"Ah!"
in her heart.

#### Seven

"Okage, what do you suppose this fellow is up to?"
"Hmm, let's observe the situation a little longer."
Okage watched, peering in, calm and seemingly amused.
The monk Saneumi first bound the writhing woman to a pillar,
and finally stripped away her very last piece of clothing.

#### Eight

(The stripping done,) he let out a great sigh, "Bū—!"
"Ah, this is a masterpiece! The way the rope bites into her skin,
and the white flesh swells around it—
that is the perfect appetizer for sake."
The woman was uttering faint, panicked cries (*hiihī*) deep in her throat,
but her voice was too hoarse to project anymore.
Having grown tired of the pillar bondage, Saneumi
then re-tied her hands behind her and hoisted her from the ceiling.
As she hung exposed, he began to relentlessly strike her ample buttocks
with a split bamboo stick (*waretake*), *bishi-bishiri*. A dull, muffled sound rang out,
and her skin twitched and shuddered.
Just as a cat toys with a mouse, the monk Saneumi
was amusing himself by tying and untying, then tying and untying the woman, repeating the process for pleasure.

#### Nine

Saneumi bound all four of the woman's limbs together into a single knot. Just like...

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Section Type** | Episodic narrative fiction/pseudo-reportage, titled "Okage Gensaburō Nikki" (The Diary of Okage and Gensaburō). This suggests a frame narrative of travelers encountering shocking situations, common in *Kitan Club* serialization. |
| **Author Attribution** | Not explicitly named in this snippet, but the diary format implies the narrator (Gensaburō) is the chronicler, or an anonymous author writing in the first person plural (The "two of us," referring to the observing couple, Okage and Gensaburō). |
| **Editorial Voice** | The tone is sensationalistic, detached, and clinical, typical of Ero-Guro reportage meant to catalog shocking taboos rather than condemn them. The narrator (Gensaburō) shares the voyeuristic pleasure of the events with Okage. |
| **Target Audience** | Adult male readership seeking vicarious excitement, emphasizing the transgression of sacred boundaries (monk engaging in extreme sadism/sexual violence). |
| **Positioning** | Page 20 suggests it is an ongoing feature, likely a serialized story or travelogue, emphasizing the journey into the bizarre and illicit. |
| **Structural Elements** | The text uses numbered sections (Six, Seven, Eight, Nine) to denote distinct stages of the encounter or changes in the sadist's technique, lending a structured, almost clinical feel to the violence. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Term / Concept | Annotation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **お加代源三郎日記** | A fictionalized travelogue structure popular in mid-20th-century pulp. The couple, Okage and Gensaburō, function as observers and participants in illicit scenes, granting the reader permission to voyeurism. |
| **坊主 (Bōzu)** | Priest/monk. The core transgression here is the depiction of the monk, Saneumi, as a greedy, lustful sadist (*don'yoku riko* 貪欲利己). The corrupt Buddhist priest who abuses his power and religious immunity was a long-standing trope in Japanese literature, especially post-Meiji, used to critique hypocrisy and traditional authority. |
| **めえ酒 (Meezake)** | Also written as 隠し酒 (Kakushizake). Hidden or secretly consumed alcohol. Here, the phrase "drink hidden sake within their bodies" refers metaphorically to indulging in taboo or illicit desires, which the observing couple are implicitly doing by watching the scene. |
| **女ッ気 (Onnakke)** | Female energy, sexual appeal, or access to women. The monk complains of a "long drought" (*hisashiburi*), providing a rationalization (for the monk/sadist) for his extreme actions. |
| **腰巻 (Koshimaki)** | Loincloth or wrap-around petticoat, historically the most basic undergarment worn by Japanese women. Its removal is the final act of stripping and humiliation (Section 7). |
| **柱縛り (Hashira Shibari)** | Pillar bondage, a fundamental technique in *Shibari* (Japanese rope bondage). Tying a person to a central pillar or column is visually dramatic and exposes the torso, central to the illustration in Section 8. |
| **割れ竹 (Waretake)** | Split bamboo stick, a common implement used for corporal punishment, especially flogging or caning, in traditional Japan and frequently deployed in S/M narratives of this era. The onomatopoeia *Bishi-bishiri* emphasizes the sharp, stingy impact. |
| **猫がねずみをなぶるやうに** | "Just as a cat toys with a mouse." A classic simile for sadistic enjoyment, emphasizing the power dynamic where the victim is tormented not for practical reasons, but for the pleasure of control and repeated torture (tying and untying). |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term | Reading | Primary Meaning | Contextual / Euphemistic Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **めえ酒** | Meezake | Hidden/Secret Sake | Metaphor for hidden, intoxicating, and illicit desire or pleasure. |
| **うわべ** | Uwabe | Surface, Appearance | Facade, hypocrisy; specifically the monk's outward sanctity versus his inner depravity. |
| **ニタニタ** | Nitani-ta | Grinning widely/Gap-toothed | A crude, vulgar, and self-satisfied smile, indicating low social status or malicious pleasure. |
| **女ッ気** | Onnakke | Female energy/presence | Euphemism for sexual access or satisfaction. |
| **叩き売り** | Tataki-uri | Selling cheaply/at a loss | Literally, "beating and selling." Here, refers to forceful, humiliating transaction; likely sexual slavery or forced prostitution. |
| **絶景** | Zekkyō | Superb View, Breathtaking Scenery | Used ironically/sadistically to describe the sight of a tortured, bound, naked woman. A clinical, dehumanizing gaze. |
| **酒のサカナ** | Sake no sakana | Side dish for sake | Appetizer. The bound woman’s physical suffering is described as a perfect object (sakana) to enhance the pleasure of drinking sake. |
| **ヒイヒイ** | Hii-hii | Shrill cries, wheezing | Onomatopoeia for pained, suppressed, high-pitched moaning or crying. |
| **ひくくり** | Hikukuri | Shuddering, Quivering | Descriptive term for flesh spasming/twitching under repeated strikes. |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

| Theme | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Voyeurism as Entertainment** | The narrative is framed entirely through the passive, prolonged observation by Okage and Gensaburō. They do not intervene; rather, Okage finds the scene *omoshiro-sou* (amusing/interesting), implying that witnessing the atrocity is their primary source of pleasure. The audience is invited to share this detached voyeurism. |
| **The Corrupt Sacred** | The central conflict is the desecration of the temple space and the profound hypocrisy of the abbot (Saneumi Hōjū). The use of his religious title and bald head (*bōzu atama*) emphasizes the transgression of established social and moral order, a key element of the *ero-guro* sensibility. |
| **Sadistic Pleasure and Objectification** | The victim is reduced entirely to an object (a *sakana* for sake, a "thing" to be sold). Saneumi’s delight lies purely in the *process* of control and physical manipulation ("tying and untying, tying and untying"), illustrating a pure, unbound sadism described as the joy of a cat with a mouse. |
| **The Spectacle of Flesh** | The descriptions focus minutely on physical reactions: the white flesh swelling around the ropes, the skin quivering from the bamboo strikes, the hoarse, suppressed cries. The text fetishizes the physiological effects of torture. |
| **Commoditization of the Victim** | The plan to "beat and sell her off" to a brothel (Section 6) confirms the absolute lack of dignity afforded the woman, positioning her as property to be abused and then traded for profit. |
