「ほらほら笑い出しましたわ。いいわね。きっとあなたの顔もわたしの目に映っているわ」
「あなたが僕の目の中に住んで、僕があなたの目の中に住んでいるんですよ」
「そうですとも、そこですとも」と、女は興奮して叫びました。

「わたしは夜になって目を閉じる時にはいつでもこう考えますのよ。このきれいなまぶたで、あなたを保護しているのだと、そう思って静かに伏せるの。あなたは私の目の中に眠っているのよ。目だけがこうして、いつまでも一緒にいるのですわ。外の何だって一緒にいることはできませんわ。手だって握っているときだけ一緒ですし、触れてもすぐ離れ離れになり、どんなに強く結んだところで一時的で、すぐ二つになりますわ。だが目はちゃんと一緒にいますものね。本当に不思議ですわ」
こう言って女はまた微笑みかけました。男も微笑みました。女のロマンチックな話が大変気に入ったのでした。
「ほうほう、わたしが笑っていますわ。ほうほう」
と女は面白そうに指差しました。

「ほうほう僕も笑っている」
と男も指差しました。
「幸福なものですね、恋というものは」
と女は言いました。
「どうしてこんなに可愛いんでしょう」
目は絶えず微笑み交わしていました。

「一度、あなたを疑ったことがありましたのよ。そうでしたわ。あなたの目の中に本当に寝ているときでも、わたしが住んでいるかと、それでこの前温泉に行った夜、こっそりあたし、あなたの目を開けて見たのよ。そしたらね、やはりわたしはいましたわ。あんなうれしいことはなかったわ」
もちろん二人はまだ若いのでした。男は事務員、女はタイピスト、若いから二人はロマンチックなのです。

第三景

これは風景ではありません。話です。
「枕元で相手の女が帯からはじめて、シュッと次第に肩から着物を落していくのを寝床の中で見ているのは、何とも言えないぞくぞくする気持ちですわ、実際あれは美しいものです」
花びらが落ちてくるように、美しい着物が羽織、着物、それから下着と落ちてきて、その度に肌の匂いが濃くなってこぼれてきますね。女房となると、あの感じが味も素っ気もなくて義務の感じですが、別の女となるとたまらなくいい気持ちのものです。あの瞬間の気持ちが忘れられませんよ」
と、ある会社の課長さんが話しました。
× × ×
「女というものは知らない間が一番きれいなものです。知ってしまうとぶくぶくして醜いものに見えます。だから優れた女たちは、巧みにこのコツを使いますよ。すると男というものは、だらしなくなるものです」
これはホテルの人の話。

第四景

「若い人たちは羨ましいわね」
奥さんが突然言いました。隣にいた若い人たちの恋愛散歩を見ているのは、頭の禿げかかった夫婦です。二人は若さを拾いにこの郊外の野原くんだりまで来て、芝生の上に並んで盃を酌み交わしていました。
「みんな楽しそうだね」
「わたし達もあんな時代がありましたのね。でも、あなたはこんなに、つるりと禿げましたし」
そう言って奥さんは旦那さんの禿頭を撫でました。
「これでも気持ちは若いよ」
「昔のような気持ちになってみましょうか。あの頃は本当に幸福でしたわね。あぁ、あの新婚旅行の温泉宿のこと思い出してもぞくぞくしますわ」
奥さんは昔のことを考えてうっとりしました。
「何かお前はうれしそうだね」
「ええ、とても楽しいんですの」
「いい年をして、人が笑うよ」
「誰も同じことですわ。老いらくの恋と言いますものね」
奥さんは、あたりを見回して言いました。そこで旦那は若々しく情熱的になった奥さんに、若い恋人を見ました。
「でも何だかきまりが悪うございますのね」
今度は奥さんが言いました。こうした話が長い間続けられていました。花が散って蝶が飛んでいました。だが二人はとうとう顔を赤めてあたりを見回すのでした。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Look, look, started to laugh. Oh, good, isn't it? Surely your face also in my eyes is reflected."
"You in my eyes live, I in your eyes am living."
"That is so, right there," the woman excited, shouted.

"I, when it becomes night and [I] close [my] eyes, always think like this. With these beautiful eyelids, protecting you, so thinking quietly lower [them]. You in my eyes are sleeping. Only eyes like this, forever together are. Anything else together to be is not possible. Hands, only when holding are together, and if touched, immediately separate, and no matter how strongly tied, temporary, and soon become two. But eyes properly together are. Truly it is mysterious."
Thus saying, the woman again smiled. The man also smiled. The woman's romantic talk greatly pleased [him].
"Ho ho, I am laughing. Ho ho," the woman interestingly pointed.

"Ho ho, I also am laughing," the man also pointed.
"Happy thing it is, love that is," the woman said.
"Why is it so cute?"
Eyes constantly smiles exchanged.
"I, hey," the woman soberly said.
"Once, you I doubted. It was so. In your eyes really even when sleeping, whether I live, for that the other day at the hot spring night, secretly I, your eyes opened and looked. Then, as expected, I was there. Such a happy thing there was not."
Of course, the two were still young. The man a clerk, the woman a typist, because young the two are romantic.

Scene Three

This is not a landscape. It is a story.
"At the bedside, the partner woman from the obi starting, swoosh gradually from the shoulders kimono dropping, inside the bed watching, an indescribable shivering feeling it is, actually that is a beautiful thing."
"Like flower petals falling, beautiful kimono—haori, kimono, then underwear—come falling, each time the skin's scent becomes deep and overflows. When it's a wife, that feeling is tasteless and a sense of duty, but when it's a different woman, it's an unbearably good feeling. Ah, that moment's feeling cannot be forgotten."
So, a certain company section chief spoke.
× × ×
"Women are most beautiful when unknown. Once known, they look bloated and ugly. Therefore, superior women skillfully use this trick. Then men become slovenly."
This is a hotel person's story.

Scene Four

"Young people are enviable, aren't they?"
The wife suddenly said. Watching the young people's 'love stroll' nearby was a balding couple. The two, to pick up youth, had come to this suburban field, and on the grass lined up were drinking from cups.
"Everyone looks happy."
"We also had such a time. But you, like this, have become smoothly bald."
So saying, the wife stroked the husband's bald head.
"Even so, my feelings are young."
"Shall we try to feel like the old days? That time was truly happy. Ah, even remembering that honeymoon hot spring inn makes me shiver [with excitement]."
The wife, thinking of the past, became entranted.
"You seem happy about something."
"Yes, it's very fun."
"At your age, people will laugh."
"Everyone is the same. They call it 'love in old age,' don't they?"
The wife looked around and said. There, the husband in his wife who had become youthful and passionate, saw a young lover.
"But somehow it's embarrassing, isn't it?"
This time the wife said. Such talk for a long time was continued. Flowers fell and butterflies flew. But the two finally turned red in the face and looked around.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Look, look! You've started to laugh. Isn't it wonderful? I’m sure your face is reflected in my eyes, too."
"You live within my eyes, and I live within yours," he replied.
"Yes, exactly!" she cried out, her voice filled with excitement.

"Whenever I close my eyes at night, I think to myself: I am protecting you with these beautiful eyelids. That's what I think as I quietly lower them. You are asleep inside my eyes. This way, our eyes can stay together forever. We can't be together in any other way, really. Even when we hold hands, it's only for a moment; the second we let go, we are apart. No matter how tightly we bind ourselves, it's only temporary and we eventually become two separate people again. But our eyes—they stay together perfectly. It truly is a mystery."
Having said this, she smiled at him again. The man smiled back, thoroughly charmed by her romantic notions.
"Ho ho! Look, I'm laughing! Ho ho!" she said, pointing playfully at his eyes.

"Ho ho! I'm laughing too," the man said, pointing back.
"Love is such a blissful thing, isn't it?" the woman mused.
"Why is it all so adorable?"
Their eyes never ceased exchanging smiles.
"You know..." she said, her tone turning somber. "There was a time when I doubted you. It’s true. I wondered if I really did live inside your eyes, even when you were asleep. So, that night we went to the hot spring, I secretly pried your eyes open to look. And there I was, just as I’d hoped! I’ve never been so happy."
They were, of course, still young. He was a clerk and she was a typist; their youth made them prone to such romanticism.

**Scene Three**

This isn't a description of a scene; it's a story.
"Watching the woman beside you start with her sash and then, with a soft rustle, let her kimono slip from her shoulders while you watch from the bed... it’s an indescribable, spine-tingling sensation. It really is a beautiful sight."
"Like petals falling, her beautiful clothes—the haori, the kimono, then the undergarments—come fluttering down. With each layer, the scent of her skin grows deeper and spills into the air. With a wife, the whole thing feels dry and dutiful, but with a different woman, it's an intoxicating feeling. I’ll never forget the sensation of that moment."
So spoke a certain company section chief.
***
"A woman is most beautiful when she is a mystery. Once you know everything, she just starts to look frumpy and unattractive. That's why clever women use this to their advantage. It makes men go weak at the knees."
This was a story from a hotel employee.

**Scene Four**

"I'm so envious of the young people," the wife suddenly remarked.
The couple watching the young lovers on their 'romance stroll' were middle-aged and the husband was balding. They had come all the way out to this suburban field to reclaim a bit of their youth, and now they sat on the grass sharing a few drinks.
"Everyone looks so happy, don't they?"
"We had a time like that once, too. But now, look at you—you’ve gone completely bald," she said, stroking his head.
"My heart is still young, though."
"Shall we try to capture that old feeling? We were so happy back then. Ah, even now, just thinking about that hot spring inn on our honeymoon gives me butterflies."
The wife drifted off into a daydream of the past.
"You certainly look happy."
"Yes, I'm having a wonderful time."
"People will laugh at us, acting like this at our age."
"It’s the same for everyone. They call it 'love in the twilight years,' after all."
The wife looked around as she spoke. In that moment, the husband saw a glimpse of a young lover in his wife, who had become so youthful and passionate.
"But it is a bit embarrassing, isn't it?" she added.
They continued talking like this for a long time. Flowers drifted through the air and butterflies flitted about. Eventually, the two of them, faces flushed red, looked around at their surroundings.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The text is arranged in a traditional vertical orientation (*tategaki*), typical of Japanese periodicals. It is divided into narrative vignettes or "scenes" (indicated by 第 三 景 and 第 四 景). 
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in the mid-20th century. Notably, the text uses *odoriji* (repetition marks) like "ゝ" and "／＼" (for *tou-tou*), and "々". 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The headers for the "Scenes" provide a clear structural break. The text is dense, with dialogue integrated into the paragraph flow rather than always starting on new lines, which is common in older literary layouts.
*   **Illustrations:** The page features simple, expressive line drawings. One shows a couple in a romantic, somewhat suggestive pose (the woman's shoulder is bare), fitting the "Scene Three" description of clothes falling. Another illustration at the bottom shows flowers and a butterfly, mirroring the ending of the final story.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "-71-" is centered at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The orthography (use of *kyū-jitai* like 戀 for 恋, 氣 for 気) and the specific social roles mentioned (clerk, typist, section chief) point toward the early post-war period.
*   **Social Roles:** 
    *   **Typist (タイピスト):** In the mid-20th century, being a typist was considered a modern, relatively prestigious "office lady" (OL) job for young women before marriage.
    *   **Section Chief (課長 - Kachō):** This role epitomizes the "salaryman" culture of the Showa era, representing middle management and the specific social perspective of the working male.
*   **Leisure Culture:** Mentioning "hot spring inns" (*onsen*) and "romantic strolls" (*ren'ai sanpo*) reflects the popular leisure activities of the era. The suburban field (*kōgai no nohara*) suggests the "hiking" and "picnic" craze of the mid-Showa period.
*   **Marital Conventions:** The Section Chief's dialogue reflects a common (if sexist) period sentiment regarding the difference between the "duty" of a wife and the "excitement" of other women, highlighting traditional gender dynamics.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **昂奮 (Kōfun):** An older way of writing 興奮 (excitement).
*   **しんみり (Shinmiri):** Describes a quiet, solemn, or heart-to-heart atmosphere.
*   **ぞくぞく (Zokuzoku):** Onomatopoeia for shivering. Here it denotes a mix of physical excitement and emotional thrill (butterflies).
*   **味も素っ気もない (Aji mo sokke mo nai):** An idiom meaning "dry," "blunt," or "lacking in charm/flavor."
*   **くんだり (Kundari):** A suffix added to places to express a sense of distance or to belittle the location (e.g., "all the way out to...").
*   **盃を汲む (Sakazuki o kumu):** To pour and share sake together.
*   **老いらくの恋 (Oiraku no koi):** A poetic term for romantic love experienced in old age.
*   **とう／＼ (Tou-tou):** Written with repetition marks; modern form is とうとう (finally/at last).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Idealism vs. Reality:** The first part presents a highly idealized, almost surreal romantic dialogue between young lovers (seeing oneself in the other's eyes). This is contrasted later with the "tasteless duty" of marriage described by the Section Chief.
*   **Nostalgia and Aging:** The final scene emphasizes the cyclical nature of love. The older couple sees their younger selves in the "envied" young people, but ultimately finds a "young passion" within their own long-standing relationship.
*   **The Male Gaze:** Scene Three explicitly addresses the male experience of watching a woman undress, framing it as a "beautiful" and "spine-tingling" event, while also presenting a cynical view of female aging and familiarity.
*   **Modernity vs. Tradition:** The young couple (clerk/typist) represents the "modern" Westernized romance (*romanchikku*), while the older couple drinking sake on the grass represents a more traditional Japanese domesticity that still retains a core of romance.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Vignettes, Social Commentary, Magazine Column.
*   **Themes:** Romance, Nostalgia, Marriage, Social Classes (Salaryman/Office Lady), Aging, Domesticity.
*   **Tone:** Romantic, Cynical (in part), Nostalgic, Slightly suggestive.
