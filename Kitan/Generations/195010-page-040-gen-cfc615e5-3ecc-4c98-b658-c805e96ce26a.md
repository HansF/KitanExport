「トアン・ドラ！　どうしたんですかい？」
　駈けつけてきたドラは、いきなりアリーの鼻先へ指輪をつきつけ
「この指輪、貴様のか！」
　そこへ、バブが駈けつけて、肩で息をききながら
「アリー、トアン・ドラは、その指輪をおまえが盗んだと思ってるんだよねえ。お母さんから貰つたんだわねえ」
「そうだよ、お袋の片身だよ、だからさあ、可愛いおまえにやつたんだわなあ」
「いやいや！　てめえのお袋つてのは、めくらのコーヒ挽きだつたぢやねえか。繩のれんみてえな着物きやがつてよお、ヘン、真鍮の耳飾りひとつ持つてやがらなかつたのを、おれや、よく知つてるんだぞ」
　ドラは、がに股をふん張つて叫んだ。
「でも、トアン、ほ、ほんとに貰つたんでさあ」
「ぢや、いつもらつた」
「そ、それは、死、死んだときでさあ」
「馬鹿野郎！　あのときやあ、てめえまだちつぽけなガキで、素つ裸になつてよお、海岸で、やどかりと遊んでたぢやねえか」
「そ、そうか知らねえが、貰つたのはたしかでさあ」
「馬鹿こけ！　この大嘘つき奴が！　白状しろ！──しねえとあらば、さかさにつるして塩水ぶつかけるが、いいか！」
「そ、そりや、トアン、あんまり、ムゴイヤ」
「むごいもへつたくれもあるか！　こいー！」
　ドラは、アリーのゴボウのような手をつかんでひきたてようとした。
「ひえー！　か、かんべんして下つせえ──」
　アリーは、弓のように折れ曲つて逃れようとしたが、あまりに、力みかえると、腕だけ残りそうなので
「ト、トアン、申上げやす、じつは、ジョ、ジョホーラに貰つたんたで」
「なに？　ジョホーラ？　あの美人の淫賣にか？」
「へえ、いつわりは申しません──あ」

ツ！　バブ、な、なんでもないんだよお」
　しかし、バブは、驚きのあまりプクプク震え、蛸のように唇をとがらし、羽根の中で風船がふくれてから、きゅうつと鳴りだす、あの笛みたいな声で
「まあ！　アリー、ジョホーラみたいなけがらわしいアマと──くやしいッ！」
　細い眼を吊りあげ、爪をたててアリーに飛びかかつた。
　で、ドラは、さつとアリーの前に立ちはだかり、怒り狂つているバブを、まともにぎゆつと抱きとめた。
「まあッ！　けがらわしいッ！」
　バブは、身もだえしたが、ドラが、ヤブにらみの眼をしめて気持よがつているので、いきなり、その眼玉に、ベツと唾のめつぶしをくれてやつた。
「うえー　ベツベツ」
　ドラは、眼をパチパチやつたり、唾を拭いた手をズボンになすりつけたりした。

　三
「へへへ、まあいいや──おい！　アリー一緒にこいッ、ジョホーラの家へ行くんだ」
　そういつてドラは、アリーの後に廻り、乱暴に小突きながら歩き出した。

　ジョホーラは、この島随一の美人で淫賣だが女神のように優しい女であつた。
　小さいときから轉々と人手に渡り、邪悪な人々に虐めぬかれた孤兒の彼女としては、こういう商売をするよりほかに生きてゆく道がなかつた。
　彼女は、海岸の椰子林の蔭にポツンと建つている赤屋根の、扉や窓に綺麗な色彩のほどこした家に住んでいた。
　ジョホーラに惚れているあらゆる職業の男達が寄つて建ててやつたものである。
　ドラとアリーは、海岸傳いにやつてくると、コソ泥のように、ぬうつと入口へ首を突込み、應接間の豪華な調度品をきよろく一見してから、ゴク可憐な言葉で
「ノーナ（娘さん）ノーナ」
と声をかけた。
「どなた？」

「トアン・ドラ！ どうしたんですか？」
駆けつけてきたドラは、いきなりアリーの鼻先へ指輪を突きつけ、
「この指輪、貴様のか！」
そこへバブが駆けつけて、肩で息を切りながら、
「アリー、トアン・ドラは、その指輪をお前が盗んだと思っているんだよねえ。お母さんから貰ったんだわねえ」
「そうだよ、お袋の形見だよ。だからさあ、可愛いお前にやったんだわなあ」
「いやいや！ てめえのお袋っていうのは、盲目のコーヒー挽きだったじゃないか。縄暖簾（なわのれん）みたいな着物を着やがってよお。へん、真鍮の耳飾り一つ持っていやしなかったのを、俺はよく知っているんだぞ」
ドラは、がに股を踏ん張って叫んだ。
「でも、トアン、ほ、本当に貰ったんでさあ」
「じゃあ、いつ貰った？」
「そ、それは、死、死んだ時でさあ」
「馬鹿野郎！ あの時は、てめえはまだちっぽけなガキで、素っ裸になってよお、海岸でヤドカリと遊んでいたじゃないか」
「そ、そうか知らないが、貰ったのは確かでさあ」
「馬鹿ぬかせ！ この大嘘つきめ！ 白状しろ！ ──しないとなれば、逆さに吊るして塩水をぶっかけるが、いいか！」
「そ、そりゃあ、トアン、あんまり酷（むご）いよ」
「酷いもへったくれもあるか！ 来い！」
ドラは、アリーのゴボウのような手を掴んで引き立てようとした。
「ひえー！ か、勘弁して下せえ──」
アリーは、弓のように折れ曲がって逃れようとしたが、あまりに力み返ると腕だけ残りそうなので、
「ト、トアン、申し上げやす。実は、ジョ、ジョホーラに貰ったんでさあ」
「なに？ ジョホーラ？ あの美人の淫売（いんばい）にか？」
「へえ、偽りは申しません──あ」

「まあ！ アリー、ジョホーラみたいな汚らわしいアマと──悔しいッ！」
細い目を吊り上げ、爪を立ててアリーに飛びかかった。
そこでドラは、さっとアリーの前に立ちはだかり、怒り狂っているバブをまともにぎゅっと抱き留めた。
「まあッ！ 汚らわしいッ！」
バブは身悶えしたが、ドラが、薮睨（やぶにら）みの目を細めて気持ちよがっているので、いきなりその眼球に、べっと唾の目潰しを食らわせてやった。
「うえー、べっ、べっ」
ドラは目をパチパチさせたり、唾を拭いた手をズボンに擦り付けたりした。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Tuan Dora! What happened?"
Dora, who came running, suddenly thrust a ring in front of Ali's nose:
"This ring, is it yours!?"
There, Babu came running, and while breathing with shoulders (panting):
"Ali, Tuan Dora thinks you stole that ring, doesn't he? You received it from your mother, didn't you?"
"That's right, it's a memento of my mother. That's why, I gave it to lovely you, didn't I?"
"No, no! Your mother was a blind coffee grinder, wasn't she? Wearing clothes like a rope curtain, hmph, she didn't have even a single brass earring, I know that well!"
Dora, plantng his bow-legs firmly, shouted.
"But, Tuan, I r-really received it."
"Then, when did you get it?"
"Th-that was, when she d-died."
"You idiot! At that time, you were still a tiny brat, becoming stark naked, playing with hermit crabs on the beach, weren't you?"
"I-I don't know if that's so, but that I received it is certain."
"Don't give me that crap! You big liar! Confess! —If you don't, I'll hang you upside down and splash salt water on you, got it!?"
"Th-that, Tuan, is too cruel."
"Cruel or whatever! Come!"
Dora grabbed Ali's burdock-like hand and tried to pull him away.
"Hieee! P-please forgive me—"
Ali tried to escape by bending like a bow, but as if his arm might remain behind if he strained too much:
"T-Tuan, I will speak. Actually, I g-got it from Johora."
"What? Johora? From that beautiful harlot?"
"Yes, I do not tell a lie—ah."

"Tsu! Babu, it-it's nothing."
However, Babu, trembling from surprise, pointing her lips like an octopus, in a voice like those whistles that start to squeak after a balloon inside a feather swells:
"Good heavens! Ali, with a filthy woman like Johora—how frustrating!"
Lifting her narrow eyes and baring her claws, she leaped at Ali.
Then, Dora quickly stood in front of Ali and firmly hugged the raging Babu.
"Oh! Filthy!"
Babu writhed, but since Dora was narrowing his cross-eyes and looking pleased, she suddenly spat 'ptooey' right into his eyeball as a blinding attack.
"Ugh— ptooey ptooey."
Dora blinked his eyes and rubbed his hand, which had wiped the spit, on his pants.

III
"Hehehe, well fine— Hey! Ali, come with me. We're going to Johora's house."
Saying so, Dora moved behind Ali and started walking while roughly prodding him.

Johora was the most beautiful woman on the island and a harlot, but she was a woman as kind as a goddess.
Having been passed from hand to hand since childhood and bullied by wicked people, as an orphan, there was no other way to live than doing this kind of business.
She lived in a red-roofed house standing alone in the shade of a palm grove by the coast, with beautiful colors applied to the doors and windows.
It was something built by men of all professions who were in love with Johora, pooling their efforts.
Dora and Ali came along the coast and, like petty thieves, poked their heads into the entrance, and after glancing at the luxurious furnishings of the drawing room, in very delicate words:
"Nona (Miss), Nona,"
they called out.
"Who is it?"

"Tuan Dora! What’s all this about?"
Dora had come charging in, and without a word, he shoved a ring under Ali's nose. "Is this ring yours!?"
Just then, Babu arrived, gasping for breath. "Ali, Tuan Dora thinks you stole that ring. But you got it from your mother, didn't you?"
"That's right, it’s a keepsake from my mother," Ali stammered. "That’s why I gave it to you, my dear."
"Don't give me that!" Dora roared. "Your mother was nothing but a blind coffee grinder. She wore rags that looked like old rope curtains. I know for a fact she didn't own a single brass earring, let alone a ring like this!"
Dora planted his feet wide and glared at him.
"But, Tuan... I r-really did get it from her."
"Oh yeah? When?"
"W-when she d-died."
"You lying dog! Back then you were just a naked little brat playing with hermit crabs on the beach! You wouldn't know a keepsake from a seashell!"
"I-I don't know about that, but I definitely got it!"
"Don't talk back to me! Confess now, or I’ll hang you upside down and douse you in salt water! You want that!?"
"T-Tuan, please, that's too much!"
"Too much? I'll show you too much! Move!"
Dora grabbed Ali’s spindly arm and tried to haul him off.
"Eeeek! Please, have mercy!" Ali bent double, trying to squirm away, but realized his arm might pop out of its socket if he resisted any harder. "T-Tuan, I’ll talk! The truth is... I got it from Jo-Johora!"
"What? Johora? You mean that beautiful whore?"
"Yes, it's the truth, I swear—"

"Babu, wait! It’s not what it looks like!" Ali cried.
But Babu was trembling with rage, her lips pursed like an octopus. In a high-pitched, squealing voice—like a toy whistle—she screamed, "I can't believe it! Ali, with a filthy slut like Johora? How could you!?"
She bared her nails and lunged at Ali. Dora jumped between them, catching the hysterical Babu in a tight embrace.
"Let go! You're disgusting!" Babu struggled, but seeing the cross-eyed Dora looking entirely too pleased with the situation, she spat a thick glob of saliva right into his eye.
"Gah! Filthy—" Dora blinked frantically, wiping his face and then rubbing his hand on his trousers.

III
"Hehehe, alright, alright," Dora chuckled, unbothered. "Hey, Ali! Get moving. We're going to Johora's place."
Dora got behind him and began prodding him along the path.

Johora was the island's premier beauty. Though she sold her body, she was as gentle as a goddess. An orphan who had been shuffled from one cruel master to another since childhood, she had found no other way to survive but through the oldest profession.
She lived in a small house with a red roof tucked away in a palm grove by the sea. The doors and windows were painted in vivid, beautiful colors—a gift from the many men of various trades who had fallen for her and built the house together.
Dora and Ali crept along the shoreline and, like a pair of common thieves, poked their heads into the doorway. After gawking at the expensive furniture in the parlor, they called out in their most polite, honeyed voices:
"Nona? Nona?"
"Who's there?" a voice replied.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is formatted in a traditional Japanese right-to-left, vertical orientation. It features a mix of narrative prose and dialogue, punctuated by character sketches.
*   **Typography:** The main text uses a standard mid-century serif typeface. The use of "furigana" (reading aids) is minimal, suggesting an adult or young adult readership.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page is split into two halves horizontally. The top half contains high-energy dialogue and character interaction, while the bottom half shifts into descriptive narrative.
*   **Character Sketches:** In the middle of the page, there are five expressive sketches of supporting characters (Muskita, Ekan, etc.). These sketches act as a "Who's Who" for the reader, providing visual context to the names appearing in the story. They are drawn in a slightly caricatured, rough brush style typical of 1950s manga/illustration.
*   **Structure:** The use of "三" (Three) indicates a chapter or section break, common in serialized magazine fiction.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Setting:** The terminology strongly suggests a setting in the **Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia)** or **British Malaya** during or shortly after the Japanese occupation period (1940s-1950s). 
*   **Tuan:** A Malay/Indonesian word for "Sir" or "Master." Its use here by Ali toward Dora indicates a hierarchy, though Dora seems to be a rougher, perhaps Japanese or local rogue character.
*   **Babu & Jongos:** These are specific loanwords from Malay. *Babu* refers to a female servant or nanny, and *Jongos* refers to a male houseboy or servant. These terms were commonly used by Japanese personnel and settlers in Southeast Asia during the war.
*   **Nona:** A Malay term for an unmarried woman or "Miss."
*   **Johora:** Likely a play on "Johor" (a state in Malaysia). 
*   **Social Class:** The dialogue is extremely "rough" (*beranmei* style or *shitamachi* slang), utilizing terms like *temee* (you), *yagarun* (a derogatory verb suffix), and *ama* (a derogatory term for a woman). It depicts a gritty, low-class social environment.
*   **Prostitution (淫賣):** The text mentions the character Johora is an *inbai* (prostitute). In the literature of this era (the "Kasutori" culture of the late 40s/early 50s), the "fallen woman with a heart of gold" was a common trope.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **トアン (Tuan):** Malay for "Mister/Master." Used here as a title of respect/authority.
*   **淫賣 (Inbai):** An archaic/derogatory term for a prostitute. Today, *baishun-fu* or other terms are used.
*   **形見 (Katami):** A memento or keepsake of a deceased person.
*   **縄のれん (Nawa-noren):** Literally a "rope curtain." Used metaphorically to describe very cheap, tattered, or coarse clothing.
*   **アマ (Ama):** A derogatory term for a woman, similar to "bitch" or "wench" in this context.
*   **薮睨み (Yabunirami):** Cross-eyed or having a squint. Often used in period literature to denote a shifty or comical character.
*   **目潰し (Metsubushi):** A "blinding" attack. Usually refers to throwing sand or pepper, but here used humorously for spitting in someone's eye.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Colonial Exoticism:** The story utilizes "South Seas" (Nanyo) tropes popular in Japan during the 1940s and 50s—palm trees, beautiful "native" women, and a sense of lawlessness or adventure.
*   **Jealousy and Honor:** The conflict between Babu and Ali over his association with Johora highlights themes of sexual jealousy and social standing (even among the lower classes).
*   **Tragic Heroine:** Johora is introduced as a victim of circumstance ("passed from hand to hand," "evil people"), a common narrative device to make a "sinful" character sympathetic to the reader.
*   **Rough Masculinity:** Dora represents a rough-and-tumble protagonist who uses threats of violence ("salt water") but is also shown as a somewhat comical figure (getting spit in the eye).

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serialized Novel (Emonogatari/Shousetsu)
*   **Genre:** Adventure, Colonial Drama, Pulp Fiction
*   **Thematic Tags:** Southeast Asia, Colonialism, Crime, Romance, Poverty, 1950s Literature
*   **Classification:** Mature (references to sex work, rough language)
