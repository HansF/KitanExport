## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Atrichia is Evidence of a Civilized Person**
**By Kado Kotaro**

= Answering worries about lack of hair in places it should be =

No, really, [the statue] gave birth. Originally a Jizo of easy childbirth, because wives without children came from afar and, most respectfully, rubbed the Jizo’s lower abdomen, her lower body became completely worn out.
So, to make repairs, they performed an abdominal surgery on her womb, and lo and behold, small and large various child-Buddha statues appeared in their original forms; thus, the rumor that it is indeed a Child-giving Jizo true to its name is widespread, but regarding the God of easy delivery, there is another interesting story.

Riding trains or buses, something I often notice is that even with a beauty whose face you admire, when you see thick fuzz growing fuzzily on the arm gripping the strap, it immediately spoils the mood.
And then, another thing is the peach fuzz or unwanted hair growing on the nape of the neck. It's the same with men's head hair and beards. If one goes to a barbershop and has the hair neatly cut and beard shaved, and if the aftermath shows sharp white skin, it gives a sense of so-called masculine beauty, but long hair full of dandruff and an unkempt beard grown out is a disagreeable thing.
American gentlemen seem to consider shaving neatly every morning a matter of grooming, but anyway, it seems that as human culture progresses, hair becomes less.
As proof of that, look at the Ainu of Hokkaido or the savages of Taiwan whose culture is delayed. They grow hair all over their bodies to the extent that they are no different from gorillas. Everyone knows that revue dancers shave their armpit hair completely.
Anyway, it is a matter of removing unnecessary unwanted hair cleanly. However, in the world, there is such a thing as "worrying about lack of hair where it should be," and it seems to often trouble young ladies before marriage.
Thinking about it, it's a stupid story. Not being bears or gorillas, for humans who wear clothes and wrap their whole bodies, whether there is unwanted hair or not, there is no hindrance at all to sexual life.
It has no relation to pregnancy or childbirth, and also, when performing an appendicitis surgery, since nurses shave it off "zori-zori" without hesitation, it's no exaggeration to say it's rather a nuisance.
Things like saying that making a woman with atrichia (hairlessness) one's wife brings bad luck are nothing but superstitions that are relics of a former age.
In America, they praise bald heads and have a stylish proverb: "On a busy street, weeds do not grow." If your girlfriend has atrichia, tell her:
"You are born with the qualities of a step-ahead civilized person. Oh, my sun."

**Strange/Humorous Tale**

On the way back to Nara from Sakurai on the Sakurai line, from a small station called Nagara, three young girls who seemed to be out buying staple foods boarded, having filled their hand-tote bags to the bursting point. Listening to them chatter "pecha-kucha," they were Osaka girls who seemed to be in this area for the first time. Passing Tamba-ichi and Ichinomoto, when the train approaching the next station stopped, simultaneously:
"Obitoke-e! Obitoke-e!" [Untie belts! Untie belts!]
That voice came. Startled and lifting their hips, they said in unison:
"Oh, what shall we do? I have two-tan [lengths of cloth] wrapped around my stomach, and it says 'Untie belt.' How embarrassing, because it says 'Untie belt,' do we have to become naked?"
They hurriedly looked out and voiced. However, the train departed without incident. The moment they looked out the window with relieved faces, they suddenly looked embarrassed:
"What, isn't 'Obitoke' just the name of the station? It's making fun of us."
But you see, when you get off at this Obitoke Station, the names of the two temples on the right and left, one being "Obitoke Koyasu Jizo" and the other "Obitoke Koyasu Jizo Hanon-in," both act like they are the real one and make child-giving prayers their selling point...
Untying belts and pregnancy.
Doesn't it seem like there's some kind of karma or connection there? To visit and be granted a child—it's not the true nature of "Onna-goroshi Enmeiin" or "Kurami-yu," but it's a deep-seated story. Don't you think so, friend? The ancient capital of Nara is such a place.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Mark of the Civilized: The Case for Hairlessness**
**By Kado Kotaro**

*Addressing the anxieties of those who lack hair where it "ought" to be.*

Believe it or not, the statue actually gave birth. There is a certain Jizo—a deity for safe childbirth—and it seems childless wives would travel from far and wide to stroke the statue’s lower abdomen. They did this with such fervor that the poor deity’s lower half eventually began to wear away. When they opened the statue up to perform "surgery" and repair the damage, they found dozens of small Buddha figurines inside, perfectly preserved. This only solidified its reputation as the "Child-granting Jizo," but there is another, more amusing tale concerning the gods of childbirth.

Often, while riding a train or bus, I spot a woman whose face is truly captivating, yet the moment I see thick, dark fuzz covering the arm she uses to hold the strap, the spell is instantly broken. The same goes for the nape of the neck—nothing ruins an elegant neckline like stray, unkempt hair. Even for men, it’s the same. A man who visits the barber for a clean cut and a close shave, revealing smooth, pale skin, exudes a certain "masculine beauty." Conversely, a man with long, dandruff-flecked hair and a scruffy beard is quite a repulsive sight.

They say American gentlemen consider a morning shave an essential part of grooming. It seems that as civilization advances, humans naturally lose their body hair. For proof, look at the Ainu of Hokkaido or the tribal people of Taiwan, who are considered less "civilized"—they are nearly as hairy as gorillas. Everyone knows that showgirls and revue dancers shave their underarms completely.

In short, unwanted hair should be removed cleanly and without hesitation. Yet, I hear that many young women worry about "lacking hair where it belongs" before they marry. Frankly, it’s a ridiculous concern. We aren't bears or gorillas; we are humans who wear clothes. Whether one has pubic hair or not has absolutely no bearing on one's sex life. It doesn't affect pregnancy or childbirth. In fact, if you ever need an appendectomy, the nurse will shave you bare without a second thought, so one could argue that hair is nothing more than a nuisance.

The old superstition that marrying a hairless woman brings bad luck is nothing but a relic of a bygone era. In America, they even praise baldness with the clever proverb, "Grass doesn't grow on a busy street." So, if your girlfriend is worried about her lack of hair, just tell her: "My dear, you were simply born with the advanced traits of a truly civilized person. Oh, you are my sun!"

**A Strange and Humorous Tale**

On a train heading back to Nara on the Sakurai Line, three young girls—clearly Osaka city-dwellers visiting the countryside to buy food—boarded at Nagara Station. As the train approached the next stop, the conductor shouted: "Obitoke! Obitoke!" (The name of the station, but literally meaning "Untie your belts!")

Startled, the girls jumped up. "Oh no! What do we do?" one cried. "I have two layers of cloth wrapped around my belly! Do we really have to get naked just because the conductor says 'untie your belts'?" They peeked out the window in a panic, only to realize as the train pulled away that "Obitoke" was simply the name of the station. They sat back down, red-faced with embarrassment.

But you know, Obitoke is famous for its competing Jizo temples, both claiming to be the "original" source of miracles for safe childbirth. "Untying belts" and pregnancy—there’s a deep connection there, isn't there? It’s just the sort of mysterious, layered history you find in an ancient capital like Nara.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Format & Layout
*   **Magazine Page:** This is a single-page layout from a mid-20th-century Japanese magazine. The paper appears aged and yellowed, typical of "pulp" or *kasutori* magazines of the era.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is arranged in vertical columns (read top-to-bottom, right-to-left). The main essay occupies the top and middle sections, while a separate anecdote (the train story) is boxed or separated at the bottom.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   **Main Title:** Large, bold font at the top: 「無毛症は文明人の證據」(Atrichia is Proof of a Civilized Person).
    *   **Author's Name:** Slightly smaller font below the title: 門好太郎 (Kado Kotaro).
    *   **Subtitle:** Enclosed in double-equals signs (`= =`).
    *   **Illustrations:** A central illustration of a woman in a slip, looking at her leg, provides a visual anchor and hints at the "adult" or "risqué" nature of the content.

### Typography
*   **Kanji:** The text uses *Kyūjitai* (traditional kanji), such as 證據 (modern: 証拠), 驛 (modern: 駅), and 髮 (modern: 髪).
*   **Kana:** The text uses traditional *kyū-kanazukai* (e.g., ひげ **だつ** て for だって, **おん** な for おんな).
*   **Punctuation:** Periods and commas are used, along with specific emphasis marks like the exclamation-like dashes in the train conductor's call ("帯解けえ――").

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### The Era: Post-War "Kasutori" Magazines
The style, paper quality, and content (mixing humor, minor erotica, and pseudo-science) are hallmarks of the *Kasutori* magazine era (roughly 1946–1952). These magazines were cheaply made and focused on "three S's": Speed, Sex, and Sport/Screen.

### Westernization and Beauty Standards
The author's appeal to "American gentlemen" and the idea that hairlessness is a sign of "civilization" reflect the intense Westernization of Japanese society during the Allied Occupation. Shaving body hair was becoming a modern beauty standard for women, often modeled after Western "showgirls" and "revue dancers."

### Racial and Social Prejudices
The text contains derogatory references to the Ainu (indigenous people of Hokkaido) and "Seiban" (a historical, now offensive term for indigenous Taiwanese people), labeling them "uncivilized" based on their perceived hairiness. This reflects the colonial-era prejudices that persisted in Japanese society at the time.

### Obitoke Station (帯解駅)
Obitoke Station is a real station in Nara. The name literally means "untying the sash/belt." It is famous for the **Obitoke Jizo**, a temple where people pray for safe childbirth (the "untying of the belt" symbolizes the birth of the baby). The joke in the text relies on the Osaka girls misinterpreting the station name as a literal command to strip.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **無毛症 (Mumōshō):** Literally "Atrichia" (a medical condition of hairlessness). In this context, it's used as a euphemism for *paipan* (pubic hairlessness).
*   **興ざめ (Kyōzame):** To have the mood spoiled; a "buzzkill."
*   **襟足 (Eriashi):** The nape of the neck. In Japanese aesthetics, a clean, hairless nape is considered a key feature of female beauty.
*   **生蕃 (Seiban):** A historical, derogatory term for indigenous Taiwanese people. 
*   **二反 (Ni-tan):** "Tan" is a unit of measurement for cloth (approx. 11 meters). Here, the girl refers to the long abdominal wraps (*hara-maki*) worn for warmth or support during pregnancy.
*   **キタン (Kitan):** Written in katakana, likely referring to *Kitan* (奇譚) meaning "strange or mysterious tales."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Civilization vs. Primitivity:** The central argument is a "social Darwinist" claim that less body hair equals a higher state of evolution. This was a common (though scientifically baseless) rhetorical trope used to justify modern grooming habits.
*   **Gender Expectations:** The text places a heavy emphasis on female grooming (shaving arms and napes) to maintain "beauty," while also attempting to reassure women that lacking pubic hair is a "modern" advantage rather than a shameful defect.
*   **Humor and Misunderstanding:** The "Obitoke" anecdote plays on the trope of "city folk" (the Osaka girls) being confused by regional religious customs/place names, creating a humorous contrast between modern girls and ancient traditions.
*   **Eroticism disguised as Science:** Like much pulp literature, the essay uses a pseudo-sociological or medical tone ("civilized proof," "atrichia") to discuss topics that are inherently sexual or related to the body.
