**サバット (SABBAT) 悪魔の宴**

**６．神への冒涜**
宴が進むにつれて、此れが一同によつて実演されるのである。
（六）主宰者の地獄の魔王というのは、暗黒の空迄とどく様な二本の角を持ち、その毛髪は叢林のように縺れて、いつも裸で老婆のような乳房を持ち失つた耳、脚はケモノのように裂けて一ツの尾を持つている。
（七）さて、いよいよ悪魔の六誠が、鳴物入りで開始される。
先づ最初に、淫猥極まる、とも人間では考えも及ばぬ様なのが野蛮な音楽につれて、目ぐるましい迄に展開される。
このダンスが高調に達するに従つて、騒ぎは一層乱脈になり母と子、兄と妹、老人と若い嫁若者と老婆といった極めて破廉恥な関係が行われ、父と子、兄と弟、といった同性愛の猛烈なもの迄あらわれてくる。
（八）かくしてありとあらゆる神にむいた不自然な罪悪行為が、鴉が曉を告げる迄、秘密の大夜会は続けられるのである。
（九）日本では狼の怪物が、真夜中に辻堂で宴会を開いて踊り狂つて居る所を一人の武士がその巨魁と思われる男、即ち猿の頭目に弓を射かける話なんかは、多少サバットらしい所もあるが、西洋に於ける真正のものとは大いに距離があるようだ。

**の身の冗談**
……なると思うと、メリヤスのシャツも、毛のオーバも、いるんじゃありませんか。
そんなことを心配すると、どうして明らかになれましょう。
よろしく、ラクダのセーターでも着て、熱いうどんでも食べてみることですね。

**＜川柳＞ 戦後派草紙**
アベックは親子のような組もあり
アドラムと避妊薬とは常備薬
食うために闇の女もアルバイト
エロショーのかぶりつきには禿あたま
競輪と宝くじとで夜が明ける
生れたら捨て子をせよと男言い。

**キタン 笑話**
「父さん、そら無理だよ、あすこのおやじ、この借金払つたら、又貸してやるといつてるんだもの。」
「長を探り短を補う」
「君は丈夫で羨ましいよ。幸福とは要するに健康だからなァ」
「いや、健康でも文無しじゃつまらん、僕は金持ちの君が羨ましいよ」
「どっちもどっちだよ。両方持つという幸福にはなれんものかなア」
「……なに訳ないぜ。僕は丈夫だし君は金がある。そこで一つお互いに持ちよつて、二人一緒にかなりや何んでもないや。」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Sabbat (SABBAT) Devil's Banquet**

**6. Blasphemy toward God**
As the banquet progresses, this is performed by everyone.
(6) The master called the Devil King of Hell has two horns reaching even to the dark sky, his hair is tangled like a thicket, always naked with breasts like an old woman, missing ears, legs split like a beast’s, and possesses one tail.
(7) Now, finally, the Devil’s Six Sincerities begin with a flourish. First, things extremely obscene, such as humans cannot even conceive, unfold dizzily along with savage music. As this dance reaches a climax, the commotion becomes further chaotic; extremely shameful relationships such as mother and child, brother and sister, old man and young bride, young man and old woman are conducted, and even intense homosexual things like father and child, brother and younger brother appear.
(8) Thus, all sorts of unnatural sinful acts directed against God continue at the secret grand evening party until the crow announces the dawn.
(9) In Japan, there is a story of a wolf monster holding a banquet at a roadside shrine at midnight and dancing madly, where a samurai shoots an arrow at the man thought to be the leader, namely the monkey boss; this has some Sabbat-like parts, but it seems there is a great distance from the authentic ones in the West.

**Personal Jokes**
...when I think it will become [cold], don't you need knitted shirts and wool overcoats? If you worry about such things, how can [the truth] become clear? You should just wear a camel-hair sweater and try eating hot udon.

**<Senryu> Post-war Era Scrapbook**
Among couples (avec), some pairs look like parent and child.
Adorm and contraceptives are household medicines.
To eat, even "women of the dark" work part-time.
At the front row of the erotic show, there are bald heads.
With bicycle racing and lotteries, the night breaks into dawn.
"If it is born, abandon the child," the man said.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Witches' Sabbath: A Devilish Feast**

**Section 6: Blasphemy**
As the festivities intensify, the gathered crowd begins their performance. 
(6) The presiding Lord of Hell is a monstrous sight: two horns pierce the midnight sky, and his hair is a matted thicket. He stands naked, possessing the withered breasts of a hag and the ears of a beast, his legs cloven like an animal's, dragging a single tail behind him.
(7) Then, the "Six Rituals of the Devil" commence with a cacophony of sound. Obscenities beyond human imagination unfold to the rhythm of primal music. As the dance reaches a fever pitch, all order collapses into depravity. Taboos are shattered: mother and son, brother and sister, the elderly and the young—all engage in shameful trysts. Even the most intense displays of same-sex relations between fathers, sons, and brothers are seen.
(8) These unnatural sins, all directed as an affront to the divine, continue throughout the secret midnight gala until the first crow of dawn.
(9) In Japanese folklore, there are tales of wolf-monsters carousing at roadside shrines, or a samurai shooting an arrow at a monkey-headed chieftain leading a midnight revel. While these share some DNA with the Sabbath, they pale in comparison to the true, unbridled darkness of the Western tradition.

**Post-War Satirical Verses**
Some couples strolling by look more like father and daughter.
Sleeping pills and birth control are now the family staples.
To put food on the table, even "street girls" take side jobs.
The front row of the striptease is always a sea of bald heads.
People gamble their lives away on bike races and the lottery.
"If you have the baby, just dump it," the man coolly says.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a traditional vertical layout (tategaki) common in Japanese periodicals. It is dense, with multiple small sections separated by thin borders or decorative lines.
*   **Typography:** The main body text is a standard Mincho font. Headlines for the "Sabbat" section are bold and slightly stylized. The "Senryu" (short poems) section uses a different, perhaps slightly more informal typeface.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page is anchored by a large, somewhat crude illustration on the left depicting a chaotic, outdoor ritual (the Sabbath). A smaller, more "modern" illustration appears in the center, showing a woman and a dog, likely related to the "Personal Jokes" or "Funny Stories" section.
*   **Graphic Design:** The use of parentheses and numbered lists for the "Sabbat" article suggests a pseudoscientific or "encyclopedic" tone, typical of occult features in pulp magazines.
*   **Aesthetic:** The overall feel is "Kasutori"—cheap paper, slightly scandalous imagery, and a mix of the grotesque, the erotic, and the mundane.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Kasutori Era:** The term *kasutori* refers to a cheap spirit made from sake lees. It was said that if you drank three cups, you’d pass out—much like these magazines, which often folded after only three issues. They represent the "liberated" but desperate atmosphere of post-war Japan under the US occupation.
*   **Western Occultism:** Post-war Japan saw a fascination with Western "forbidden" knowledge. The description of the Sabbath here is a highly sensationalized, likely poorly translated or reimagined version of European witchcraft myths, emphasizing "unnatural" acts and blasphemy to shock the reader.
*   **Social Reality (The Senryu):** The short poems reflect the grim realities of the late 1940s:
    *   **Avec (アベック):** A French-derived loanword for "couples," very popular in this era.
    *   **Adorm (アドルム):** A brand of sedative/sleeping pill popular at the time, often associated with suicide or escapism.
    *   **Yami no Onna (闇の女):** "Women of the dark," a euphemism for unlicensed prostitutes who operated in the black markets (yami-ichi).
    *   **Gambling:** Bicycle racing (keirin) was legalized in 1948 to generate tax revenue, reflecting the state's and the people's economic desperation.
*   **Sexual Taboos:** The mention of "homosexuality" (同性愛) and "incest" in the Sabbath section highlights the magazine's goal: to push the boundaries of what was printable after the lifting of wartime censorship.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **サバット (Sabbat):** Specifically refers to the Witches' Sabbath.
*   **叢林 (Surin/Sōrin):** A thicket or dense forest; used here to describe the devil's matted hair.
*   **破廉恥 (Harenchi):** Shameless, disgraceful. A common term in erotic/scandalous writing.
*   **アベック (Avec):** From French *avec* (with). In Shōwa-era Japan, it meant a romantic couple.
*   **アルバイト (Arubaito):** From German *Arbeit*. In Japan, it specifically means part-time work.
*   **かぶりつき (Kaburitsuki):** Sitting in the very front row (of a theater or show), literally "biting into" the performance.
*   **キタン (Kitan):** Strange or mysterious tales (奇譚).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eroticism disguised as information:** The "Sabbat" article uses the guise of folklore or history to describe sexual acts that would otherwise be censored.
*   **Nihilism and Cynicism:** The *Senryu* and "Funny Stories" sections display a deep cynicism about post-war life. Themes of poverty, unwanted pregnancy ("abandon the child"), and the transactional nature of sex are presented with a dark, humorous shrug.
*   **East vs. West:** Section (9) of the Sabbat article explicitly compares Japanese folklore monsters to Western ones, suggesting a burgeoning interest in global (though distorted) cultural comparisons.
*   **The "Post-War" (Sengoha) Identity:** The use of "Sengoha" in the poetry section title points to a new, somewhat adrift generation defined by the collapse of old Imperial values.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Pulp Magazine / Occult Feature / Satirical Poetry / Humorous Anecdotes.
