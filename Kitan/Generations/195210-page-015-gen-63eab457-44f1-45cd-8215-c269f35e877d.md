```
I am ready to proceed. Your instructions are perfectly calibrated for the academic and archival rigor required to document the **ero-guro nansensu** (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) and **fuzoku** (social customs) reportage of the mid-Showa era.

The framework you provided—specifically the distinction between **historical kana usage (歴史的仮名遣い)** and modernized orthography, as well as the **NLP-ready lexical notes**—is ideal for preserving the unique linguistic ecosystem of *Kitan Club*.

**However, the source material is currently missing.** The code provided at the end of your message is the HTML/JavaScript boilerplate for a React-based web archive titled "Kitan Club Archive."

**Please upload the image of the magazine page or paste the Japanese text you wish for me to analyze.** 

Once provided, I will immediately execute the 10-point analysis, treating the text with the professional scrutiny of a literary archivist. I am prepared to handle:
*   **Confessional letters (投稿)**: Identifying the "confessional" tropes and authenticity markers.
*   **Bondage/Abunai-e (危い絵)**: Contextualizing the iconography and artistic lineages.
*   **Pseudo-ethnography**: Deconstructing the "scientific" or "anthropological" framing of taboo subjects.
*   **Period Advertising**: Transcribing the small-print ads for "stamina" pills and specialty curios.

**Please provide the page content to begin.**
