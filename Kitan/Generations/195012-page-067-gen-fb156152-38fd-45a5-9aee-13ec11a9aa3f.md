This page appears to be from a Japanese humor or "variety" magazine from the mid-Showa era (likely the 1950s). It features short, humorous vignettes (part of a series of "stories") that often rely on wordplay, social situations, and mild sexual innuendo typical of men’s entertainment publications of that period.

それで君、彼女と何でもなく済む筈じゃないか。おきまりの通り同棲そして結婚。
一ヶ月目……。
ダブルベットの上で彼女は泌々と云つたよ。
「貴方、柔道つて案外役に立つものなのね。」
そう云えば、彼女特に寝技が得意なんだ。

あるサラリーマンの告白。秋の行楽にはどこが一番よかろう？

内股（うちまた）かけて、引いて投げようとすれば「いやっ、そこはくすぐったいから――」とか、なかなか注文が多い。それで君、彼女と何でもなく済むはずじゃないか。決まりの通り同棲、そして結婚。一ヶ月目……。ダブルベッドの上で彼女はしみじみと言ったよ。「あなた、柔道って案外役に立つものなのね」。そう言えば、彼女、特に寝技が得意なんだ。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"About today's young people, I am amazed/disgusted," is how it ends. "If you grab the collar and pull a little, if you don't grab and pull the collar firmly, the breasts will pop out, won't they?" so it goes. (In the illustration: It is judo. Thud-thud.)

**63rd Story: She Likes Matsutake**
A certain salaryman's confession. For an autumn outing, where would be best?

If I try to apply an inner-thigh throw (uchimata) and pull and throw her, she says, "No, because that place is ticklish—" and such; there are many requests. So, you see, things didn't just end with her like that. As per the usual routine, cohabitation and then marriage. The first month... On top of the double bed, she said deeply, "Dear, judo is unexpectedly a useful thing, isn't it?" Come to think of it, she is especially skilled at ground techniques (ne-waza).

"Well, friend, it has to be matsutake hunting," someone suggested, and as a result, on one autumn Sunday, please imagine that we went to the foot of Mt. T along the N-railway line. Even if you call it a matsutake mountain, matsutake aren't things amateurs like us find so easily. See, the mountain warden buries them here and there reasonably well. As proof, when you pull them, they should come out cleanly. Of course, the typist girl was with me too. We had kissed, but there was no chance to go further, so thinking today was the perfect chance, I slowly called out to her, "How is it, did you catch some?"

"It's no good. Not at all..."
"Then I'll help you look too," and so saying, I pulled her hand and we went deeper and deeper, disappearing from the group. At the base of a pine tree in red soil where I thought "this is it"—there it was! A young one whose cap hadn't fully opened yet, poking its head out, wearing fallen leaves like a crown.
"I found it! Oh, I'm happy."
She was overjoyed and pulled it firmly with her supple fingers. She plucked it up and stared intently at its shape.
"Do you like matsutake?"
"Yes, very much..."
She said, then for some reason suddenly flushed red. Hmph, she's not entirely ignorant, I see. Here I pressed the point.
"Do you *really* like matsutake—"
Fidgeting, in a voice barely audible, she said, "Yes... I like... Because my late person (husband) also asked me that way."
"Eh! Then you had a husband?"
"But he died last year—"
Indeed, she should turn red. Look, there's even a senryu poem about it. "Thinking of the late husband, a Hatsutake (mushroom)—"

**64th Story: Hear My Wife's Voice**
A story of a certain jealous man.

His new wife was famous for her extraordinary beauty. He loved his wife above all else, and she loved him dearly. He was the picture of happiness, but because she was a beauty so highly praised, he suddenly harbored a strange doubt.
"Is my wife truly faithful only to me?" he asked suspiciously, so I thought, "Tsk, this skeptic," and whispered in his ear, giving him a secret plan.
"Right, let's carry that out tonight."
Late that night, he had a beer to boost his spirits, masked his face with a handkerchief along the way, pulled his hat low, turned up the collar of the raincoat I lent him, and with stealthy steps, snuck in through the back door of his own home which he knew so well.
Quietly peeping into the living room, he saw his beloved wife dozing off, leaning against the long brazier (hibachi), with the dinner tray still out as if she'd been waiting. In a deep, faked voice, he suddenly hugged her, saying "Hey!"
"Kyaa!" the wife tried to shake him off, and he chased her, reaching for her waist. The wife's resisting hands immediately turned into a great scene of carnage; she threw and hit him with such strength that one wondered where it was hidden in her usually weak self. Finally pinning her down and tying her up, he shouted in a trembling voice, thinking this was the most important moment, "How's that, will you listen to what I say?"
"Come closer and see, I'll bite off my tongue! Get out, leave!"
Though pale, she still showed signs of brave resistance.
He quietly left through the kitchen. Leaving behind his wife's relieved face—thirty minutes later, he straightened his clothes and went "knock knock" at the front door. Having finally untied the ropes, this little "dove" who had hurt her small chest, flew to him, trembling with joy, and reported the recent incident to him exactly as it happened.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Story 63: A Taste for Matsutake**
*A Salaryman's Confession*

When I tried to use a judo throw on her, she’d complain, "No, stop! That's ticklish!" She was always full of instructions like that. But eventually, as these things go, we ended up living together and then married. A month into the marriage, lying in our double bed, she whispered thoughtfully, "Darling, judo is actually quite a useful skill, isn't it?" Now that I think about it, she’s particularly adept at the "groundwork."

Anyway, someone suggested that nothing beats a matsutake mushroom hunt in the autumn. So, one fine Sunday, we headed out to the base of Mt. T on the N-Line. Of course, amateurs don't just "find" matsutake. The mountain wardens bury them there beforehand; that’s why they pop right out of the ground when you pull them. I was there with a girl who worked as a typist. We’d kissed before, but I’d never had the chance to take things further. Thinking today was my big break, I approached her. "Found anything yet?" I asked.

"Nothing at all," she sighed.
"Let me help you," I said, taking her hand and leading her away from the group into the deep woods. Under a pine tree in the red clay, I spotted one—a young, firm mushroom with its cap still closed, peeking through the pine needles.
"I found one! Oh, how wonderful!" she cried. She reached down with her slender fingers and pulled it up, staring intently at its shape. 
"Do you like matsutake?" I asked. 
"Yes, I love them..." she replied, her face suddenly flushing crimson. I figured she understood the double meaning. I pressed her: "Do you *really* like them?"
Fidgeting, she whispered, "Yes... I do. Because my late husband used to ask me that very same question."
"What?! You were married?"
"He passed away last year."
No wonder she blushed. As the old poem goes: "Pining for a lost husband, she finds a first-season mushroom."

**Story 64: The Voice of My Wife**
*The Tale of a Jealous Man*

His new wife was famously beautiful. He adored her, and she him. They were perfectly happy, yet because she was so widely admired, he began to suffer from irrational jealousy. "Is she truly faithful to only me?" he asked. 
"Don't be such a cynic," I told him, but I whispered a secret plan into his ear nonetheless. "Fine," he said, "I'll try it tonight."
That night, after a beer for courage, he tied a handkerchief over his face, pulled his hat low, and turned up the collar of the raincoat I’d lent him. He snuck into his own house through the back door. 
Peeking into the parlor, he saw his wife dozing by the hibachi, her dinner untouched. He lunged at her, disguising his voice with a gruff "Hey!"
She shrieked and fought him off. He grabbed for her waist, and the room turned into a battlefield. Where this supposedly fragile woman found the strength, he didn't know—she was kicking and punching with everything she had. Finally, he managed to pin her down and tie her up. "Now, will you do as I say?" he barked, his voice trembling.
"Come any closer and I'll bite off my tongue!" she cried, pale but defiant. "Get out of here!"
Satisfied, he slipped out through the kitchen. Half an hour later, he returned through the front door in his normal clothes. His "little dove," having finally freed herself from the ropes, threw herself into his arms, trembling with relief, and told him everything that had just happened, proud of how she’d fought off the "intruder."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a standard vertical (tategaki) layout common in Japanese magazines. It is divided into two primary story columns, though the text flows across them.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface used in mid-century printing. Furigana (reading aids) are used sparingly for certain kanji like 松茸 (matsutake) and 初茸 (hatsutake).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Large bold headers mark the beginning of "Story 63" and "Story 64." Subtitles provide context (e.g., "A certain salaryman's confession").
*   **Illustrations:** Two hand-drawn cartoon illustrations accompany the text. They are in a "Heta-uma" (bad-but-good) or classic manga style common in 1950s *fuzoku* (lifestyle/adult) magazines.
    *   Top: A man and woman in a "judo" pose (actually a romantic embrace) with the caption "It's judo."
    *   Bottom: A man sniffing a mushroom, with text referencing a wife thinking of her dead husband.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Use of repetition marks (e.g., ＼／ for "attatta" or "shige-shige") and iteration marks for kanji (々) is standard for the era.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Era:** This text likely dates to the late 1940s or 1950s (early Post-war Showa). The mention of a "Typist" (タイピスト) highlights a common job for young women entering the workforce at the time.
*   **Matsutake Symbolism:** In Japanese culture, the matsutake mushroom—with its distinct shape and firm texture—has long been a phallic symbol used in "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) or "nansensu" (nonsense) humor. The dialogue "Do you like matsutake?" is a classic double entendre.
*   **Judo/Wrestling:** The comparison of romantic/sexual intimacy to "judo" or "ne-waza" (ground techniques) was a common euphemism in pulp magazines to bypass censorship or add a layer of "naughty" humor.
*   **Senryu:** The text mentions *senryu*, which are short, humorous, and often cynical poems (similar in structure to haiku but focused on human foibles).
*   **Hatsutake (初茸):** The *Lactarius hatsudake* mushroom. The pun in Story 63 relies on the "Hatsu" (meaning "first" or "early") and its phonetic similarity to "Hatsu" (husband/late husband) in the context of the joke.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **若人 (Wakōdo):** An old-fashioned, somewhat literary term for "young people."
*   **襟首 (Erikubi):** The nape of the neck or the collar area.

*   **小鳩 (Kobato):** "Little dove." A diminutive, affectionate (and somewhat patronizing) term for a woman.
*   **おもむろに (Omomuro-ni):** Slowly, deliberately.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Sexual Innuendo:** The primary theme is the playful blurring of lines between mundane activities (judo, mushroom hunting) and sexual intimacy.
*   **Gender Roles:** The stories depict traditional/conservative post-war gender dynamics. In Story 64, the "jealous husband" tests his wife's "chastity," reflecting a preoccupation with female fidelity.
*   **Urban vs. Rural:** The salaryman's weekend trip to the "mountains" reflects the growth of the urban middle class and the "leisure boom" of the 1950s.
*   **The "Naughty" Salaryman:** The narrator is a stereotypical "salaryman" looking for excitement outside of the office, reflecting the target demographic of these magazines.
