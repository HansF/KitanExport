## Output

```
This is an excellent and highly structured framework for the digital preservation and scholarly analysis of Showa-era *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque) literature. I am ready to operate within this persona and apply this 10-point protocol.

**However, you have not yet provided the source material (the image of the magazine page or the raw Japanese text) to be processed.**

The HTML/JavaScript code you included appears to be the boilerplate for the archive's frontend, but it does not contain the literary content of a *Kitan Club* issue.

### **Next Steps:**
Please **upload the image(s)** of the page(s) or **paste the raw Japanese text** you would like me to analyze. 

Once provided, I will immediately generate the full report, covering:
1. **Faithful Transcription** (preserving historical orthography).
2. **Modernized Normalization**.
3. **Literal and Literary Translations**.
4. **Structural, Cultural, and Lexical Analysis**.
5. **Thematic Tagging and JSON Metadata.**

**I am standing by for the source material.**
