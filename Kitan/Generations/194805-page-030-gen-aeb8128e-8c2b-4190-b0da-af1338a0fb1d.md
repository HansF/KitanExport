**大木悦二**

**一、迷宮入りはなぜ多いか**
諸君は探偵小説が好きだろう。僕も好きだ。外國の名探偵であるホームズ、神父ブラウン、ポワロなどは、中學生時分さかんに讀みふけつた忘れられないものだ。日本の名探偵と云えば、岡本綺堂の半七、野村胡堂の錢形平次、江戸川亂步の明智小五郎、甲賀三郎の土井甲南なんかが記憶に残っている。
實際に、あの名探偵中にかつたら、どんなに難しい犯罪も、小説の上ではスラスラと解決し、たちまち眞犯人が擧がることになつている。ところが、實社會では、このごろ凶惡犯罪のほとんどが迷宮入りであり、警察は何をしているのかと不思議に思われる。これが實際の犯罪と探偵小説のちがうところだ。アメリカやイギリスには、本當にホームズやポワロのような敏腕な私立探偵が居て、官憲と協力して犯人を逮捕するのかも知れないが、日本にはそうした街の名探偵は居ない。もつぱら檢事の指揮下に、刑事が活躍するわけだ。
日本は昔からそうなので、例の半七や平次も素人探偵じやなく、十手捕縄を預かるお上の岡引だ。
まして新憲法下の警察制度では、人權保護の建て前から、昔のように容疑者を自由に引つぱつて來て、ブタ箱にぶちこみ、拷問や誘導訊問で自白させたり、三十日の拘留期間が切れると、隣りの警察へタライまわしにして取調べを續けるということも出来ない。いくら臭いと睨んでも物的證據を確実に揃え、檢事の捜査又は逮捕令状をもつてゆかないかぎり、家宅捜索も身柄拘束も出来ないのだ。
だから、カンや拷問で犯人を擧げるわけにゆかない以上、捜査の中心は、科學的方法による確實な物的證據の蒐集になるのが當然なのだ。時代の流れがつかり變つているのだ。
一番地味な、一番苦心の要る、縁の下の力持的仕事であつた「法醫學」の重要性が大きく脚光を浴びて浮かびあがつてきたのは、こうした情勢の變化によるものなのだ。
ここに一つの強盜強姦殺人の證據がためを法醫學の方面から解説してみよう。

**二、現場檢證と死体確認**
初夏の早朝。大阪の燒野原の瓦礫だらけの畑に横たわっている若い女の死体を、通行人が發見したとする。出所からは警察電話で管轄の本署へ急報だ。本署からはすぐ、府警察局と大阪地方檢察廳へ連絡する一方、司法主任を長とした私服刑事と制服警官の一隊が、自動車とオートバイで現場へ直行だ。
待つ間もなく、府警察局と檢察廳の自動車、つづいて各新聞社の自動車がケタタマしい警笛もろとも殺到する。犯行現場は塵一本のなさも記載録眞に取られ、死体もあらゆる角度から撮影され、警察醫によつて死体外部の状況が細大洩らさず記入される。現場附近に落ちているものでおよそ證據になるものは髪一本、砂一握りでも見逃さず綿密に採集される。これが現場檢證であり、死体確認なので、ある犯罪が行われ、人間が死んでいたという最も根本のアウトラインが確実に證據だてられたわけだ。これから科學捜査はスタートするのだ。

**三、司法解剖**
次にいよいよ法醫學の獨壇場である死体檢査すなわち司法解剖に移る。この解剖は必ず捜査判事の命令か、あるいは檢事の囑託が必要なのだ。解剖の時間と場所にも次のような制限があつて、勝手氣ままにはやれない。
①時間は特にやむを得ない事情のある場合以外は、普通、日光のある間に終了しなければならない。だからあらかじめ必要な時間を計つて着手する。
②場所は普通大學の法醫學教室附屬の解剖室で行なうが、遠隔で、死体を運べないようなときは、なるべく廣い、光線がよく當り、かつ用水の充分ある場所を選ばねばならない。
この死体檢査（司法解剖又は裁判解剖と呼ぶ）では何が目的かと云うと、
①死んだ原因は何か。
②自然に死んだのかどうか。
③自然死ならばどんな病気で死んだか。

諸君は探偵小説が好きだろう。僕も好きだ。外国の名探偵であるホームズ、神父ブラウン、ポアロなどは、中学生時分に盛んに読みふけった忘れられないものだ。日本の名探偵といえば、岡本綺堂の半七、野村胡堂の銭形平次、江戸川乱歩の明智小五郎、甲賀三郎の土井甲南なんかが記憶に残っている。
実際に、あの名探偵の手にかかったら、どんなに難しい犯罪も、小説の上ではスラスラと解決し、たちまち真犯人が挙がることになっている。ところが、実社会では、このごろ凶悪犯罪のほとんどが迷宮入りであり、警察は何をしているのかと不思議に思われる。これが実際の犯罪と探偵小説の違いだ。アメリカやイギリスには、本当にホームズやポアロのような敏腕な私立探偵がいて、官憲と協力して犯人を逮捕するのかもしれないが、日本にはそうした街の名探偵はいない。もっぱら検事の指揮下に、刑事が活躍するわけだ。

まして新憲法下の警察制度では、人権保護の建前から、昔のように容疑者を自由に引っ張って来て、ブタ箱にぶち込み、拷問や誘導尋問で自白させたり、三十日の拘留期間が切れると、隣の警察へたらい回しにして取調べを続けるということもできない。いくら臭いと睨んでも物的証拠を確実に揃え、検事の捜査又は逮捕状を持ってゆかない限り、家宅捜索も身柄拘束もできないのだ。
だから、勘や拷問で犯人を挙げるわけにいかない以上、捜査の中心は、科学的方法による確実な物的証拠の収集になるのが当然なのだ。時代の流れがすっかり変わっているのだ。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Corpse**
**Oki Etsuji**

**1. Why Are Unsolved Cases So Frequent?**
You gentlemen probably like detective novels. I also like them. Foreign famous detectives such as Holmes, Father Brown, Poirot, and so on, are unforgettable things I was intensely engrossed in reading during middle school days. If speaking of Japan’s famous detectives, Okamoto Kido’s Hanshichi, Nomura Kodo’s Zenigata Heiji, Edogawa Rampo’s Akechi Kogoro, Koga Saburo’s Doi Konan, and such are remaining in memory.
Actually, if it were in those famous detectives’ [hands], no matter how difficult a crime, on top of a novel, it is solved smoothly, and instantly the true criminal is caught. However, in actual society, these days almost all heinous crimes enter the labyrinth [unsolved], and people wonder strangely what the police are doing. This is the difference between actual crime and detective novels. In America or England, truly sharp private detectives like Holmes or Poirot exist and perhaps cooperate with authorities to arrest criminals, but in Japan, such "detectives of the town" do not exist. Exclusively under the prosecutor's command, detectives are active.
Japan has been that way since long ago, so the mentioned Hanshichi and Heiji were also not amateur detectives, but were the government’s *okappiki* (policemen) who were entrusted with the *jutte* (truncheon) and *torinawa* (binding rope).
Furthermore, under the police system of the New Constitution, from the standpoint of human rights protection, unlike the old days, [police] cannot freely drag suspects in, throw them in the "pig box" (jail), make them confess through torture or leading questions, or when the 30-day detention period expires, rotate them to the neighboring police station to continue investigation. No matter how much [they] glare [at a suspect] thinking they are "smelly" (guilty), unless they prepare physical evidence reliably and bring a prosecutor’s investigation or arrest warrant, they cannot perform home searches or physical detention.
Therefore, since it is not possible to catch criminals by intuition or torture, as a matter of course, the center of investigation becomes the collection of reliable physical evidence by scientific methods. The flow of the times has completely changed.
The importance of "Forensic Medicine," which was the most plain and most effort-requiring "behind-the-scenes" work, has come to bathe in the spotlight and emerge because of these changes in the situation.
Here, let us explain the solidifying of evidence for a case of robbery-rape-murder from the aspect of forensic medicine.

**2. Crime Scene Investigation and Body Confirmation**
Early morning in early summer. Suppose a passerby discovers the corpse of a young woman lying in a field full of rubble in the burnt ruins of Osaka. From the [police] box, it is an emergency report to the jurisdictional main station via police phone. From the main station, while immediately contacting the Prefectural Police Bureau and the Osaka District Public Prosecutors Office, a team of plainclothes detectives and uniformed officers headed by the judicial chief goes directly to the scene by car and motorcycle.
Without time to wait, cars from the Prefectural Police Bureau and the Prosecutors Office, followed by cars from various newspaper companies, rush in together with piercing sirens. The crime scene is taken in record photographs without missing a single speck of dust, the body is photographed from every angle, and the condition of the exterior of the body is filled in by the police doctor without missing anything great or small. Among things fallen near the scene, anything that could be evidence—even one hair or a handful of sand—is meticulously collected without overlooking. This is the crime scene investigation and body confirmation; thus, the most fundamental outline that a certain crime was performed and a human was dead is reliably evidenced. From here, the scientific investigation starts.

**3. Judicial Autopsy**
Next, finally, we move to the exclusive domain of forensic medicine: the body examination, namely, the judicial autopsy. This autopsy necessarily requires an order from an investigating judge or a request from a prosecutor. There are limits like the following on the time and place of the autopsy, so it cannot be done at one's own whim.
① Regarding time, except for cases with especially unavoidable circumstances, usually, it must be finished during the time there is sunlight. Therefore, one measures the necessary time in advance and starts.
② Regarding place, usually, it is performed in the autopsy room attached to a university’s forensic medicine department, but in remote areas where the body cannot be moved, one must choose a place that is as wide as possible, where light hits well, and where there is sufficient water for use.
In this body examination (called judicial autopsy or trial autopsy), if one asks what the purpose is:
① What is the cause of death?
② Whether the person died naturally or not.
③ If it is a natural death, what kind of illness did they die of?

**The Corpse**
**By Etsuji Oki**

**1. Why Do So Many Cases Go Unsolved?**
I imagine you all enjoy a good detective novel. I certainly do. I’ll never forget how, as a middle schooler, I was utterly absorbed in the adventures of world-famous sleuths like Sherlock Holmes, Father Brown, and Hercule Poirot. As for Japan’s own icons, characters like Okamoto Kido’s Hanshichi, Nomura Kodo’s Zenigata Heiji, Edogawa Rampo’s Kogoro Akechi, and Saburo Koga’s Konan Doi remain etched in my memory.
In the hands of these master detectives, no matter how complex the crime, everything is resolved with effortless grace, and the culprit is brought to justice in no time—at least, that is how it works in fiction. In the real world, however, most heinous crimes these days end up as "cold cases," leaving the public to wonder what on earth the police are doing. This is where reality and fiction diverge. While Britain and America may have brilliant private eyes like Holmes or Poirot who cooperate with the law to catch criminals, Japan has no such "neighborhood detectives." Here, detectives operate strictly under the direction of public prosecutors.
This has always been the case in Japan. Even the famous Hanshichi and Heiji were not amateurs; they were *okappiki*—official agents of the government entrusted with the truncheon and the binding rope. 
Furthermore, under the police system of our New Constitution, the protection of human rights is paramount. The police can no longer simply drag a suspect in, throw them in a "pig box," and beat a confession out of them through torture or coercion. They can no longer "shuttle" a suspect from one station to another to extend detention indefinitely once the thirty-day limit expires. No matter how much a detective "smells" guilt, they cannot conduct a search or make an arrest without solid physical evidence and a warrant.
As a result, since intuition and torture are no longer viable, the focus of investigation has naturally shifted toward the collection of concrete physical evidence through scientific methods. The tide of the times has turned completely. Forensic medicine, once a thankless, behind-the-scenes discipline, has been thrust into the spotlight because of this shift in the legal landscape. Let us now examine how forensics is used to build a case in an instance of robbery, rape, and murder.

**2. Crime Scene Investigation and Identifying the Body**
Picture an early summer morning. A passerby discovers the body of a young woman lying in a rubble-strewn field amidst the burnt ruins of Osaka. An emergency call is placed from a local police box to the jurisdictional station. The station immediately alerts the Prefectural Police and the District Prosecutors Office, while a team of plainclothes detectives and uniformed officers, led by the judicial chief, rushes to the scene.
Before long, vehicles from the police and prosecutors arrive, followed by a swarm of press cars, all blaring their sirens. Not a speck of dust at the scene is missed by the forensic photographers. The body is photographed from every conceivable angle, and a police doctor meticulously records every detail of the external condition. Even a single hair or a handful of sand is carefully collected as potential evidence. This is the stage of scene investigation and body confirmation—establishing the fundamental fact that a crime has occurred and a life has been lost. This is where the scientific investigation truly begins.

**3. The Judicial Autopsy**
Next comes the exclusive domain of forensic medicine: the judicial autopsy. This procedure cannot be performed on a whim; it requires a formal order from an investigating judge or a request from a prosecutor. There are also strict regulations regarding the time and place.
1. **Time:** Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the autopsy must be completed during daylight hours. The physician must estimate the time required before beginning.
2. **Place:** Autopsies are typically performed in a university’s forensic laboratory. However, if the scene is too remote to transport the body, a location must be chosen that is spacious, well-lit, and has an ample supply of water.
The primary objectives of this examination (often called a judicial or trial autopsy) are to determine:
1. The cause of death.
2. Whether the death was natural or unnatural.
3. If natural, the specific illness responsible.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The text is presented in a classic vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), common in Japanese periodicals. It is divided into three distinct sections, each marked with a bolded header using traditional numbering (一, 二, 三).
*   **Typography:** 
    *   The main title "死体" (Corpse) is rendered in a large, bold, hand-drawn or stylized font.
    *   The author's name "大木悦二" (Oki Etsuji) appears below the title.
    *   Above the title is a decorative circular emblem containing the characters "佳辞" (Kaji - Good words/remarks) and "宏幸" (Hiroyuki/Kosei - possibly a series title or an editor's column name). 
    *   The letters A, B, and C in circles appear to the right of the emblem, possibly acting as category markers or pointers for a specific section of the magazine.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and headers are clearly emphasized to guide the reader through a pedagogical or explanatory essay. The use of numbered lists at the end shows an attempt at scientific/legal clarity.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is organized into three columns per page, a standard layout for mid-century magazines to maximize readability and space efficiency.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Transition:** The text explicitly mentions the **"New Constitution" (Shin-Kenpo)**, which was enacted in 1947. This is a crucial context. Pre-war Japanese police had broad powers and were known for using "third-degree" tactics (torture and long detentions) to extract confessions. The post-war reforms emphasized human rights, necessitating a shift toward "Scientific Investigation" (Kagaku Sosa) because confessions alone were no longer sufficient or legally sound.
*   **The "Burnt Ruins" (Yake-nohara):** The mention of "Osaka’s burnt ruins" (大阪の焼野原) refers to the aftermath of the Allied firebombing of Japanese cities during WWII. This suggests the article was written in the late 1940s or early 1950s, when ruins were still a common feature of the urban landscape and a frequent setting for crime.
*   **Literary References:** The author cites several famous detectives. 
    *   **Western:** Sherlock Holmes, Father Brown (Chesterton), Hercule Poirot (Christie).
    *   **Japanese:** Hanshichi (Okamoto Kido), Zenigata Heiji (Nomura Kodo) — both "period" detectives; Akechi Kogoro (Edogawa Rampo) and Doi Konan (Koga Saburo) — modern detectives. This shows the high literacy and popularity of "Honkaku" (orthodox) mystery fiction in Japan at the time.
*   **Okappiki (岡っ引き):** These were informal assistants to the police during the Edo period. The author uses this term to contrast the "amateur" status of Western detectives with the "official" status of Japanese detectives, emphasizing that in Japan, investigation has always been a state-led endeavor.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **迷宮入り (Meikyu-iri):** Literally "entering the labyrinth." A common Japanese idiom for a case becoming a "cold case" or remaining unsolved.
*   **ブタ箱 (Butabako):** Literally "pig box." A slang term for a police lockup or jail cell.
*   **タライまわし (Tarai-mawashi):** Literally "passing the tub around." Refers to the practice of moving a suspect from one jurisdiction to another to bypass legal limits on detention time (a common pre-war police tactic).
*   **司法解剖 (Shiho Kaibo):** Judicial autopsy. This is distinct from an "administrative autopsy" (performed to determine cause of death in non-criminal cases).
*   **十手捕縄 (Jutte Torinawa):** The truncheon and binding rope used by Edo-period police. These are symbols of legal authority.
*   **科学捜査 (Kagaku Sosa):** Scientific investigation/forensics. The "new" way of policing promoted in the post-war era.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Modernization vs. Tradition:** The text frames the shift from "intuition/torture" to "science" as an inevitable evolution of a modern, democratic society. It justifies why cases might stay "unsolved" longer than in novels—because the "old ways" of forcing confessions are now illegal.
*   **Education of the Public:** The essay serves to educate the layperson on the realities of the legal system. It tries to manage public expectations regarding police efficiency by explaining the new legal hurdles (human rights, warrants).
*   **Scientific Optimism:** There is a strong sense of "Scientific Investigation" being a heroic, albeit "plain" (jimena), endeavor that replaces the charismatic but unrealistic "amateur detective" of fiction.
*   **Grit and Realism:** By using a "robbery-rape-murder" in the "burnt ruins" as an example, the author grounds the essay in the harsh, grim reality of post-war Japan, contrasting it with the "smooth" resolutions of detective novels.
