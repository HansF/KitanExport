*(Note: Due to the extreme density, visual artifacts, and degradation of the source text, especially in the middle columns, many sections lack cohesive sentence structure in the original transcription. I have normalized based on clear, identifiable grammatical fragments, converting historical kana (ゐ -> い, づ -> ず) and obsolete kanji (例: 撰 -> 選, 頗る -> 頗る, 學府 -> 学府, 圓 -> 円). Line breaks are preserved where they seem to indicate phrasing or paragraph shifts.)*

"If one chooses, not even a dream of a thousand gold pieces, words born for the sake of a stockbroker, you see."
Making this self-serving since, apart from a speculator,
one uncle who never received a life [of service] was present.
He possessed that intention. Resonating with this,
Mr. Seizaburō, originally pure and daring in nature,
From the point where there was influence,
It appears so, they say. When early, already
He was playing in Tenziku (India/distant land). In the early time period, building
He became a structure, with extreme hypersensitivity,
And became a matchless *kaggi*-ya (omen-obsessed person).
Therefore, recently, a tea stalk stood in his tea cup,
The train number today, however it may be,
No, from tempura bowl a morning spider descended,

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"If you choose to use it, this phrase is not even a wish for immense wealth, but rather a saying created solely for the stock market."
Since he interpreted this as self-serving, he had an uncle who was an exception—someone who had never led a productive life outside of being a market speculator.
Mr. Seizaburō, who resonated with this idea, was originally pure and daring by nature, and it seems that this background influenced him. Early on, he had been "playing in Tenziku" (lost in abstract, distant thought or business). In that formative period, he became utterly obsessed with structure and developed extreme hypersensitivity, transforming into a unique, incomparable *kaggi*-ya (a person obsessed with omens/superstitions).
Therefore, recently, whether a tea stalk stood up in his cup, or what today's train number might be, or if a morning spider descended from the *tendon* (tempura bowl) — all these signs obsessed him.
The occurrence of the numbers "Six marks, six, six, six," suddenly caused a commotion, something unavoidable...
He wanted to rearrange his accounts, hoping for a clean start and settling his books. This was a habit born of his profession. However, on top of this existing professional habit, he had to take on another, far more troublesome fixation. That day, his mood was extremely poor, so his pale face was clouded over from the morning.
Was this neurosis stemming from the intelligence of a man who graduated from the capital’s highest academy?
[He pondered how] even things derived from the physical laws governing British Army equipment, those that stood upon a 'sphere' [or system], were absent. He counted the next sequence of contingent occurrences from the next fold...
Mr. Seizaburō, consulting his watch, often...
Waiting for the bus bound for Horisuji Abeno Bridge after getting off the train, he stood there, pressing several memos against his chest, wearing a thin, somewhat grubby overcoat...
The train arrived without any major trouble. He...
It is not uncommon to see such people, even those who took their coats out of storage last year and have been wearing them since.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is presented in traditional **vertical writing (縦書き, *tategaki*)**, read from top to bottom and right to left.

**Format and Structure:**
1.  **Layout:** The text occupies multiple narrow columns (approximately 6-8 visible columns wide in the main segment).
2.  **Typography:** A traditional, high-contrast **Minchō (明朝) font** is used, characteristic of Japanese print media from the early to mid-20th century. The font is small and densely packed, indicating a literary publication like a novel serialization or an essay in a magazine.
3.  **Hierarchy:** The text is almost uniformly structured, lacking large headings or bolding. Paragraph breaks are indicated by standard indentation (one character space).
4.  **Punctuation:** Traditional Japanese punctuation is used: primarily **full stops (。) and commas (、)**. Quotes use traditional square brackets (「」).
5.  **Character Usage:** A mixture of *kanji*, *hiragana*, and *katakana*. *Katakana* is used for emphasis or non-native terms (e.g., カッギ屋, インテリゲンザ, バス, メモ). Many **obsolete kanji (*kyūjitai*)** (e.g., 撰, 居り, ゐた, 學府, 頗) are used, firmly placing the text in the pre-1946 (or publications resistant to immediate orthographic reforms) to mid-Shōwa era (1940s–1960s).
6.  **Page Numbering:** The number "19" is visible in the bottom right corner, suggesting this is an excerpt from a longer printed volume or magazine.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

The text offers a deep look into the psychological state of a person involved in finance during the mid-Shōwa period (likely 1940s-1960s).

1.  **Era (1940s–1960s):** The presence of *kyūjitai* suggests a publication date prior to the full normalization of orthography (post-1946), or a literary work from the 1950s/60s maintaining an archaic style. The focus on speculation (*sōba*) and stockbrokers (*kabuya*) reflects the fluctuating economic climate of post-war Japan—a time of intense rebuilding, economic bubbles, and high-stakes finance, leading to extreme psychological pressure.
2.  **Terminology: 相場師 (Speculator):** Speculators and brokers often faced extreme social and psychological stress. The text captures this by depicting the character's descent into neurosis.
3.  **Superstition and Omens:** The core conflict revolves around the character's "hypersensitivity" (*shinkei kabin*) and his transformation into a "カッギ屋" (kaggi-ya, an obsessed person relying on omens).
    *   **Tea Stalk (茶柱, *chabashira*):** A standing tea stalk is a classic Japanese symbol of good luck.
    *   **Morning Spider (朝蜘蛛, *asagumo*):** Spiders spinning webs in the morning are often considered a good omen for the day (especially for commerce). The description of one descending from a *tendon* (tempura bowl) suggests how deeply integrated these signs are into his daily life.
    *   **Sixes (六目、六、六、六):** The repetition of the number six (possibly 666, the Western "Number of the Beast") suggests an intrusion of Western anxiety/superstition into his Japanese context, blending old and new fears.
4.  **Tenziku (天竺):** While literally meaning India, in traditional Japanese literature, it often signifies a far-off, exotic, or abstract place. Here, "playing in Tenziku" likely means he was deeply absorbed in abstract financial theory or distant, complex planning, detached from reality.
5.  **Educational Reference:** Mentioning a graduate of the "capital's highest academy" (*saikō gakufu*) highlights the contrast: a highly educated, supposedly rational individual (an *interigenzā* or intellectual) reduced to relying on petty superstition due to professional stress.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**Themes:**

1.  **Psychological Decay and Neurosis:** The primary theme is the mental breakdown of the highly educated speculator, Seizaburō. His job pressures drive him into extreme hypersensitivity (*shinkei kabin*), where he can no longer distinguish between rational action and superstitious compulsion.
2.  **The Folly of Speculation:** The narrative implicitly critiques the high-stakes, unstable world of stock speculation. It suggests that financial risk-taking is so stressful that it reduces rational behavior to primitive fortune-telling (becoming a *kaggi*-ya).
3.  **Conflict between Intellect and Superstition:** Seizaburō, a graduate of the "highest academy," represents reason and modernity, yet he is utterly controlled by omens (tea stalks, spiders, numbers). The text explores the tension between his intellectual training and his emotional dependence on chance.
4.  **Contingency vs. Causality:** His reflection on the lack of "physical laws" governing phenomena (like British Army equipment) suggests he is searching for deterministic rules in the unpredictable sphere of the stock market, finding only accidental, contingent occurrences (like the train number or spider).

**Subtext and Tone:**

The tone is descriptive, slightly detached, and analytical, but carries an underlying sense of pity and observation regarding human frailty. The narrator views Seizaburō's obsession as a "troublesome habit" added to his professional routine, implying that the financial world itself fosters neurosis.

The reference to the number "666" suggests a subtextual connection to ultimate misfortune or evil, positioning Seizaburō's daily routine as a kind of self-inflicted spiritual or psychological torment.
