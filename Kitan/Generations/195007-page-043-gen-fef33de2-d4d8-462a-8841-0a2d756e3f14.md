ズロース強盗出現
―御婦人方に一大警告―
亜羅伊弥太

十三夜のお月様が、ちぎれ雲の間から、青白い夢のような光を投げかけ、星のきれいな夜でした。
あまりいゝ気持のするものではありませんから。エッ！―俺はそうではないて！―御冗談でしょう。彼女とでも、一緒ならそれ程でもありませんがね。
何處からか、生まぬるい夜風が、すうつと吹いて来て、その御婦人の首筋を舐めるように撫ぜて行きます。
その御婦人、思わず首をすぼめて、「おゝ、気味が悪い、こんな夜、おいはぎにでも、会出わなければよいが」と独り言をつぶやいた矢先、
「もし、そこのおひと、しばらくお待ちなすって、」
背後で、太い男の声がしました。
そら、おいでなすった。ぎょっとし て振り返りますと、黒い影がぬうつ と突立っているではありませんか。
でも、その御婦人、出来るだけ平静を装おって、
「あら、あたくしですの。急いでるんですけど、何か御用かしら、」
「用があるから、呼んだんじゃねえか用がなけりゃ、素通りさ。」
「そりゃ、浪花節の文句ぢやない？」
「そうか。」
この男、仲々しゃれれています。
「で、あなたは一体どなた」
「申しおくれました。何をかくそう、あつしは強盗でござんす。以後お見知り置きを、」
この強盗仲々うそついたことを言う。だが、こんな者と、知り合いになったら後がそれこそ大変だ。

人通りの全く途絶えた寂しい郊外の焼跡を、すっきりした洋装に身を包んだ奥様風の御婦人がたった一人でハイヒールの音も高らかに歩いていました。
この御婦人、一人歩きの夜道が心細くなったものか、靴音が乱れて、足はだんだん速度を増して行きます。
この物騒な世の中に、夜一人で歩くなんて、
「えゝっ！あなた様は、やっぱり、あの強盗様、ものとり様、」
「その様だけ余分だ」
「きやつ！！誰か来て！！」
「しっ！！お静かに。落ち着きなすって繋が高い。」
「と、これが壁を立てられずにいられますか、キャッ、誰か来て頂戴！」
すると、その強盗、御婦人の腕をしっかり掴んで、
「シッ！聲が高いったら。落ち着いて落ち着いて、」
どうも変です。
「ジタバタすると、短いが、がつちりしたこの棒をお見舞いするぜ。いゝかい、あつしはねえ、何も、こゝは地獄の一丁目とつとと身ぐるみ脱いで行けなんて、そんな野暮なことを言つてるじやねえんだぜ。」
「じゃ、どうすれば――ねえ強盗さんこのハンドバッグの中に、千円ばかり入つてるから、これで勘弁して頂戴なねえ、お願い、」
「分からぬ奴だなあ、おめえは。あつしは何もそんなものが欲しいと言つてやしねえじやねえか。」
「分からないのはあんたの方よ。じゃあ……エッ！じゃあ、あたしのこのからだを御所望なの。」
「と、云いたい所だが、それでもない」

Humor Short Story
Drawers Burglar Appearance
—A Great Warning to the Ladies—
Arai Yata

The 13th-night Moon-sama, from between torn clouds, cast a pale dream-like light; it was a night where stars were beautiful.
Because it is not something that makes one feel very good. Eh! —I am not that way! —You must be joking. If I were with a girlfriend or someone, it wouldn't be so bad, though.
From somewhere, a lukewarm night wind blew "sū-tto" and went stroking the lady's neck as if licking it.
That lady, unintentionally shrinking her neck, "Oh, creepy. On such a night, if only I don't encounter a highwayman or such," at the very moment she muttered the monologue,
"Excuse me, person there, please wait a while,"
From behind, a thick man's voice occurred.
There, he has come. With a start, when she looked back, wasn't a black shadow standing "nuū-tto" there?
But, that lady, pretending to be as calm as possible,
"Oh, is it me? I am in a hurry, but I wonder if you have some business?"
"Because I have business, didn't I call you? If I had no business, I'd pass by."
"Isn't that a line from a Naniwa-bushi (narrative song)?"
"Is that so?"
This man is quite witty.
"So, you, who on earth are you?"
"I am late in saying. To hide nothing, I ('atoushi') am a burglar ('de gozansu'). Please remember me hereafter,"
This burglar says quite cheeky things. However, if one becomes acquaintances with such a person, the aftermath would be truly terrible.

Through the lonely suburban ruins (burnt-out areas) where foot traffic had completely ceased, a lady who looked like a wife, wrapped in neat Western clothes, was walking all alone with the sound of high heels ringing high.
This lady, perhaps becoming uneasy about the night road walking alone, her footsteps became irregular, and her feet gradually increased speed.
In this dangerous world, to walk alone at night...
"Ehh! You are, after all, that Burglar-sama, Thief-sama,"
"That 'Sama' part is extra."
"Kyā!! Someone come!!"
"Shh!! Quietly. Calm down, your voice is high (loud)."
"And, can I stay without raising a wall (making a scene)? Kyā, someone please come!"
Then, that burglar, firmly grabbing the lady's arm,
"Shh! I said your voice is loud. Calm down, calm down,"
It is truly strange.
"If you struggle, I'll treat you to this short but solid stick. Listen, I ('atoushi'), you see, I'm not saying such unrefined things like 'This is the first block of Hell, hurry up and strip off everything and go'."
"Then, what should I do—hey Mr. Burglar, inside this handbag, there's about 1,000 yen, so please forgive me with this, hey, I beg you,"
"You're a person who doesn't understand. I ('atoushi') didn't say I wanted such a thing at all, did I?"
"The one who doesn't understand is you. Then... Eh! Then, do you desire this body of mine?"
"Is what I'd like to say, but it's not even that."

**A Humorous Tale: The Appearance of the Drawers Burglar**
*—A Dire Warning to the Ladies—*
By Arai Yata

The moon of the thirteenth night cast a pale, dreamlike glow through the tattered clouds; it was a night of beautiful stars. Not that such a night makes one feel particularly comfortable. Oh! I don't mean me! You must be joking. If I were walking with a lady friend, it wouldn't be so bad.
A lukewarm night breeze drifted in from nowhere, stroking the nape of the lady’s neck like a lingering tongue. 
The lady instinctively hunched her shoulders. "Oh, how creepy," she muttered to herself. "I only hope I don't run into a mugger on a night like this." 
At that very instant, a gruff male voice called out from behind her. "Excuse me, you there. Wait a moment."
There he was. She spun around with a gasp to find a black shadow loooming over her.
The lady, however, maintained as much composure as she could muster. "Oh, me? I'm in quite a hurry, but do you have some business with me?"
"I called out because I *have* business, didn't I? If I didn't, I'd have walked right past."
"Isn't that a line straight out of a *Naniwa-bushi* ballad?"
"Is it now?"
The man was unexpectedly witty.
"So, who exactly are you?"
"Pardon my late introduction. To be perfectly honest, I’m a burglar, at your service. I hope we shall be better acquainted."
The burglar was talking nonsense. Of course, getting "acquainted" with such a man would lead to nothing but trouble.

The setting was a lonely suburban area, still scarred by the war's fires, where all signs of life had vanished. A lady in stylish Western dress, looking every bit the respectable wife, walked alone, the sharp *clack-clack* of her high heels echoing through the stillness. 
Growing uneasy in the solitude of the night, her pace quickened, and her footsteps grew frantic. To walk alone at night in such a dangerous world...
"Eek! Then you really are... Mr. Burglar? Mr. Thief?"
"The 'Mister' is unnecessary," he retorted.
"Help!! Someone!!"
"Shh!! Quiet down. Calm yourself. You’re being too loud."
"How can I not be loud?! Help! Somebody, please!"
The burglar grabbed her arm firmly. "Hush! I said you're too loud. Just calm down, calm down."
Something was definitely off.
"If you struggle, I'll have to introduce you to this short, heavy club of mine. Now listen, I'm not some crude thug who's going to tell you 'this is the gateway to Hell, so strip naked and hand over everything.'"
"Then what do you want? Look, Mr. Burglar, there’s about a thousand yen in this handbag. Please, just take it and let me go. I'm begging you!"
"You just don't get it, do you? I never said I wanted money."
"Well, you're the one being confusing! Then... oh! Then, is it... is it my *body* you desire?"
"I'd like to say yes," the burglar replied, "but it's not even that."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Genre:** A "Humor Short Story" (ユーモア短篇), a popular format in mid-century Japanese magazines.
*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a vertical orientation, reading from right to left. It features a large, stylized header "ユーモア短篇" in a handwritten-style font.
*   **Illustration:** A cartoonish drawing sits at the top, depicting a stereotypical "burglar" in a striped shirt and cap, holding a knife (or club) and looming over a woman who looks startled but fashionable. The art style is reminiscent of 1950s manga or editorial cartoons.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and author name are prominent at the top right. The story starts with an atmospheric description of the night, followed by a dialogue-heavy scene. 
*   **Typography:** Uses standard Shōwa-era printing. The text includes some archaic kanji forms and specific kana usage (like "いゝ" for "いい") typical of the period.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Era (Post-War 1950s):** The text mentions "suburban ruins" (郊外の焼跡 - *yakeato*), a direct reference to the areas destroyed by firebombing during WWII. This places the story in the post-war reconstruction period.
*   **Zuroosu (Drawers):** The title mentions "Zuroosu" (from English "drawers"), which were loose-fitting women's underpants or bloomers common in Japan from the Taishō to early Shōwa periods. By the late 1950s, they were starting to be replaced by more modern "panties," making them a slightly old-fashioned or comical item of clothing.
*   **Ero-Guro-Nansensu:** This story falls into the "Nansensu" (Nonsense) category of humor, which often featured absurd situations, mild sexual overtones (the "drawers"), and a parody of crime/noir tropes.
*   **Naniwa-bushi (浪花節):** A form of traditional narrative singing. The lady notes that the burglar's tough-guy dialogue sounds like a theatrical ballad, highlighting the performative nature of his "criminal" persona.
*   **Currency:** The mention of "1,000 yen" in a handbag provides a chronological marker. In the mid-1950s, 1,000 yen was a significant but not astronomical amount (roughly equivalent to $2.77 USD at the fixed exchange rate of the time, but with much higher local purchasing power).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **亜羅伊弥太 (Arai Yata):** A pen name. The use of ateji (kanji used for phonetics) for a name like "Arai" is typical of humorists of the era.
*   **あっし (Atoushi/Asshi):** A rough, colloquial first-person pronoun often used by craftsmen, gamblers, or "cool" criminals in Edo-period fiction.
*   **でござんす (De-gozansu):** A stylized, archaic polite ending used by fictional low-life characters or tough guys.
*   **お見知り置きを (O-mishiri-oki o):** A formal way to say "Please remember me" or "Pleased to meet you," hilariously used here by a burglar during a mugging.
*   **地獄の一丁目 (Jigoku no itchōme):** Literally "The first block of Hell," an idiom for being at the threshold of a disastrous or fatal situation.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Subversion of Terror:** The story plays with the fear of post-war crime (common in dark, bombed-out areas) by turning a potentially violent encounter into a witty, almost flirtatious dialogue.
*   **Fetishism as Humor:** The "twist" (implied by the title) is that the burglar isn't interested in money or sexual assault, but specifically in the woman's *drawers*. This kind of "panty thief" humor was a staple of mid-century Japanese men's magazines.
*   **Urban Sophistication vs. Low-life Wit:** The "lady" in Western dress represents the aspirational middle class, while the burglar uses the speech of old Edo. Their chemistry comes from the collision of these two social types.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Humor, Short Story.
*   **Tags:** Post-war Japan, Comedy, Satire, Crime, Urban Life, 1950s, Ero-guro-nansensu.
