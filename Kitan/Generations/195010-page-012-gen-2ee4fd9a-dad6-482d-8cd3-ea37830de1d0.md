**キネマ ロマンス グラフ コント**

**女に甘い男**
街路樹の影を斜めに長く投げかけている夕方、私は巻草の煙を空にふきかけながら大股に歩いていた。と、ドスン！と何者かが突き当つて来た。野球でデットボールを喰つたようなキナ臭い衝動を受けた瞬間、私はヒョロ〜としなから（ながら）も、その打撃を与えたものにシガみついていて、大声に
「危いッ」
と怒鳴つたもんだ。
そして彼女を見出したのは、其の次の瞬間だつた。
彼女も私と同様に、私にしつかり抱きついていた。そして、その眼は恐怖に震えていた二人は暫くして平静に返つた。
狐につままれたような顔をしている、私に弁解する様に
「足のくるぶしをいためたと見えまして、足を踏み違えまして、倒れそうになりましたもんですから、」
私が彼女を助け起こした様に思つているらしい。
まつ毛の長い澄んだ眼、淡紅色の頬の艶と聰明さを表している明るい額。余りの美貌に私はうつとりとして思いに耽つていた。
彼女に会つたのが、遠い遠い昔の様に思えてならない。彼女を抱き止めた触感から来る心のときめき、懐しい恋人と、別れて遠く離れてゆかねばならないと思れる（思われる）嘆きにも似た淋しさ。
あんな事からお互に知り合いになることもあるろ（あろう）に、名前位聞いておいたらよかつたと悔まれてならなかつた。
映畫や小説にある種々の場面を想像して、あの時の向うのやり方の拙（つたな）さを悲しみつつ、寝床に入つたものゝ、中々眠れない。
その翌朝、警察署からの呼出状に驚かされて朝食もそこ／＼（そこそこ）に家を出た。
身に覚えが無いだけに警察署へ行くのは平気である可き（べき）筈だが却つて気に掛つてならなかつた。
巡査に
「何か盗難に会つた覚えはありませんか」
と聞かれてドギマギした挙句、自分の名刺の入つた財布を見せつけられたり。
「今お会わせする人がありますから、知つて居られたら、知つて居ると言つて下さい」
と言つて、夢にまで見た彼女を引き合わされ乍（なが）ら
「どこかで見た事がある様ですがはつきり覚えません」
とヘドモドして答えた。
淡い思い出を破られて警察から帰る途で買つた夕刊に
焼ビルに巣喰う不良の女の群と言う見出しの中に、美人に抱られた甘い男として自分の名前によく似た仮名を見出したのは、その次の朝のことであつた。

**箱入娘のやまい**
伏見の旅籠、秋田屋の箱入娘お糸、当年十七になるのが、ふと病名不明の患いで寝こんだ。
藥（薬）を持つて行つても食い物を持つて行つても、いや〜ばかりして一切口にしない。
さてこそと、当主の茂左衛門がにんまり笑つて、乳母を呼んで心当りはないかと聞いたが一向に、と言う。
「それでは本人に聞いてみておくれ」
本人をさぐらせたが「そんな、浮いた話ではないわいな」
と言つたという。
顔色を日増しに悪くなつて、燈心のやうに（ように）細くなる。
茂左衛門は、労咳な

街路樹の影を斜めに長く投げかけている夕方、私は巻草（タバコ）の煙を空に吹きかけながら大股に歩いていた。と、ドスン！と何者かが突き当たって来た。野球でデッドボールを食らったようなきな臭い衝動を受けた瞬間、私はひょろひょろとしながらも、その打撃を与えたものにしがみついていて、大声に「危ないっ」と怒鳴ったものだ。

狐につままれたような顔をしている私に、弁解するように「足のくるぶしを痛めたと見えまして、足を踏み違えまして、倒れそうになりましたものですから」と言った。彼女は、私が彼女を助け起こしたように思っているらしい。

**Kinema Romance Graph Conte**

**A Man Soft on Women**
An evening when the shadows of the roadside trees were being cast long and diagonally, I was walking with long strides while blowing the smoke of rolled grass (tobacco) into the sky. Then, thump! someone came crashing into me. The moment I received a suspicious shock like eating a dead ball in baseball, even while staggering, I was clinging to the thing that gave the blow and shouted in a loud voice, "Look out!"
And finding her was the very next moment. She, just like me, was clinging firmly to me. And her eyes were trembling with fear. After a while, the two of us returned to calmness.
To me, who was making a face like being bewitched by a fox, she said as if making an excuse: "It seems I hurt my ankle, and I missed my step, so I was about to fall." She seemed to think I had helped her up.
Eyes clear with long eyelashes, the luster of pale red cheeks, and a bright forehead expressing intelligence. At her excessive beauty, I was entranced and lost in thought. It felt as if meeting her was from a long, long time ago. The heart-throbbing coming from the sensation of catching and holding her, a loneliness like the lament of having to part with a dear lover and go far away.
Since people can become acquaintances from such things, I couldn't help but regret that I should have at least asked her name.
Imagining various scenes found in movies or novels, while grieving the clumsiness of the other party's way of doing things at that time, although I went to bed, I couldn't sleep easily.
The next morning, surprised by a summons from the police station, I left home with breakfast only half-finished. Precisely because I had nothing on my conscience, going to the police station should have been fine, but instead, it weighed on my mind.
By a policeman, "Do you have any memory of being a victim of a theft?" being asked, after being flustered, I was shown a wallet containing my own business cards.
"Because there is a person I will have you meet now, if you know them, please say you know them," he said, and while being confronted with her whom I had seen even in dreams, "It seems like I've seen her somewhere, but I don't clearly remember," I answered while being flustered.
The faint memory being broken, in the evening paper I bought on the way home from the police, inside a headline called "Groups of Delinquent Women Nesting in Burnt Buildings," finding a pseudonym very similar to my own name as "The Soft Man Embraced by a Beauty," was the next morning's event.

**Kinema Romance Graph: Short Stories**

**A Sucker for a Pretty Face**
One evening, as the shadows of the trees stretched long across the pavement, I was strolling along, puffing cigarette smoke into the air. Suddenly—*thud!* Someone slammed right into me. It felt like taking a "dead ball" pitch to the ribs. I staggered, but managed to grab hold of my assailant, shouting, "Watch it!"
It was then that I realized who I was holding. She was clinging to me just as tightly as I was to her, her eyes wide and trembling with terror. We eventually gathered our wits.
Seeing me standing there looking utterly bewildered, she offered a sheepish excuse: "I think I've twisted my ankle. I lost my footing and was about to tumble..." She seemed to think I had gallantly caught her to save her from a fall.
She had clear eyes framed by long lashes, rosy cheeks, and a bright, intelligent brow. I was completely smitten by her beauty. It felt as if I had known her for ages. The thrill of her touch left me with a profound, aching loneliness—the kind one feels when being torn away from a long-lost lover. I cursed myself for not at least asking her name; surely such a chance encounter was the perfect start to a romance.
That night, I tossed and turned, replaying the scene in my head like a movie and lamenting how awkwardly I had handled it.
The following morning, I was shocked to receive a summons from the police. I bolted down my breakfast and hurried out. I had a clean conscience, so I should have been fine, but I couldn't shake a nagging sense of unease.
At the station, a policeman asked, "Have you noticed anything missing lately?" Before I could process the question, he produced a wallet. My wallet. Inside were my business cards.
"We have someone we’d like you to identify," he said. They brought her in—the woman of my dreams. Flustered, I stammered, "She looks familiar, but I... I can't quite place her."
On my way home, my romantic illusions were shattered. I picked up the evening paper and saw a headline: "The Predatory Sirens of the Ruins." There, in an article about a gang of pickpockets operating out of the city's bombed-out shells, was a description of a "soft-hearted sap" who had been hugged by a beauty. The name used was a thin alias that sounded suspiciously like my own.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into multiple distinct sections. The top half contains two short stories arranged in vertical columns. The bottom half is partitioned for a cartoon/humor strip and a Shogi (Japanese chess) puzzle.
*   **Typography:** The title "キネマ ロマンス グラフ コント" uses a stylized, hand-drawn font typical of mid-century entertainment magazines. The main body text uses a standard vertical typeface of the era, with small furigana or pronunciation guides used occasionally.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The boldest element is the title at the top right, followed by the story titles. The bottom section uses a dashed border to separate the gaming and humor content from the literary text.
*   **Illustrations:** There are small, expressive illustrations accompanying the text. The "Nude Show" cartoon at the bottom uses a loose, caricatured style. The Shogi diagram is a standard grid.
*   **Columns:** The text is tightly packed in three to four columns, maximizing the use of space—a common feature in "pulp" or "low-brow" magazines of the period.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (late 1940s-1950s):** The mention of "burnt-out buildings" (焼ビル - *yake-biru*) is a direct reference to the post-WWII Japanese landscape, where bombed-out structures often became havens for the homeless or criminal elements.
*   **Kinema (キネマ):** An old-fashioned term for "cinema." Magazines with "Kinema" in the title usually focused on movie stars and romanticized urban life.
*   **Conte (コント):** Borrowed from the French "conte," this refers to very short, often humorous or ironic short stories. They were a staple of Japanese magazines in this era.
*   **The Honey Trap:** The first story describes a "honey trap" pickpocketing technique. The protagonist’s romanticization of a chance encounter is contrasted with the harsh reality of post-war urban crime.
*   **Hakoiri-musume (箱入娘):** Literally "a daughter kept in a box," meaning a sheltered, well-to-do girl. The second story uses this classic trope of a girl falling ill from "pining" or a mysterious ailment, common in Edo-period fiction.
*   **Tsume Shogi (詰将棋):** Shogi puzzles were (and are) a popular "filler" in newspapers and magazines to engage the reader's intellect.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **巻草 (Maki-gusa):** Literally "rolled grass," a poetic or colloquial term for a hand-rolled cigarette.
*   **デットボール (Detto-bōru):** "Dead ball," the Japanese baseball term for a "hit by pitch."
*   **キナ臭い (Kina-kusai):** Literally "smelling of burning," but idiomatically meaning "suspicious" or "smelling a rat."
*   **狐につままれる (Kitsune ni tsumama reru):** Literally "to be pinched by a fox," meaning to be completely bewildered or feel like one is being bewitched.
*   **ドギマギ (Dogimagi):** An onomatopoeic word for being flustered or rattled.
*   **ヘドモド (Hedomodo):** Similar to *dogimagi*, meaning to stammer or act confused/indecisive.
*   **労咳 (Rōgai):** An old term for tuberculosis (consumption), which was a common and feared disease in early to mid-20th century Japan.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Naive Urbanite:** The first story mocks the "modern man" who is so obsessed with movie-like romance that he fails to recognize a common street crime. It highlights a disconnect between romantic ideals and the gritty post-war reality.
*   **Post-War Social Disorder:** The "delinquent women" in burnt buildings reflect the social instability and poverty of the era, where traditional morality had broken down in the ruins of the cities.
*   **Irony and Humiliation:** The protagonist's regret over not getting the woman's name is turned into a public humiliation when he sees himself described as a "soft man" (sucker) in the newspaper.
*   **Traditional vs. Modern:** The second story uses an older, almost *rakugo*-style setting (an inn in Fushimi), providing a thematic contrast to the modern city story above it.
