「私があなたに対して抱いていらっしゃる疑いが晴れるというのなら、お話しするわ。あなたは一ヶ月ほど前、京浜線の電車の中で、田舎風のおばあさんに席をお譲りになったことがあるでしょう。あの荷物を持ったおばあさんは私の母でしたの。あの時、田舎から出てきた母を迎えての帰り道でしたが、ちょうどラッシュで、私は母と遠く離れてしまって。その時、母の前に掛けていられたあなたが母に席を譲ってくださったのですわ。田舎から初めて東京へ出てきた母があなたの親切に喜んで、お名前を伺ったでしょう。あの時、私、離れていたけれど、とても嬉しかったわ。そしてあなたの名前を覚えちゃったの。お礼を言おうと思っているうちに、あなたは次の駅で降りてしまって……」

春雄は一時でも彼女を疑ったのが、恥ずかしくなった。そうか、その感謝のつもりで一昨日はご馳走をしてくれたのか。
「つい、うっかりあなたを疑ったりして、済みませんでした。許してください。気晴らしにどこかへ参って、冷たいものでも飲みましょうか」
「ええ、お供しましょう」
彼女は詩子のような美しい女が悪いことをするはずがない、そう思うと、また嬉しさがぞくぞくとこみ上げてきた。
ただ、一昨日の不可解なことが、また一抹の不安となって心の奥底にわだかまっているのが、彼に忙しい思いをさせた。
この道筋は、相変わらず賑やかな、流行歌のメロディーで満たされていた。

「ある。ある」

事務員風の洋装で会う幸子を、松下君がどうして女スリだと気がつくだろう。嬉しい逢瀬が重なり、情熱が火のように燃えてくると、幸子はとうとう思い余って、山本に「足を洗いたいから絶交してくれ」と涙を流して頼み込んだ。だが、
「ふん、結婚したい？ 笑わせるな。スリの飯を四年も食ったお前が、仲間の義理と手前の色恋とどっちが大事か分からぬはずはあるめえ。俺を裏切るにはそれだけの覚悟があるんだろうなあ？」
冷ややかに鬼のようにせせら笑う山本の殺気に満ちた脅迫。幸子はいまさらながらスリの世界の恐ろしい仁義をしみじみと思い知った。
だが松下君への愛情はどうしても絶つことができない。何度も何度も山本に脅され、大阪市内を必死に逃げ回った末、ついに幸子は松下君と正式に結婚し、南区のある路地裏にささやかな愛の巣を営んだ。
だが、山本はこの隠れ家を発見すると、松下君の出勤した後を狙っては訪問してきて、金をゆするのであった。何も知らない夫、貧しい駅手の夫に、どうして女スリであった過去を打ち明けられよう。幸子は涙をのんで山本の要求に従うほかはなかった。度々のゆすりに金がなくなった幸子はある日、とうとう山本の脅迫をはねつけた。翌日、山本はふらりと地下鉄の職場に松下君を訪れた。
「エヘヘ、あんたの奥さんと俺は昔、これの相棒でしてね」
憎々しげに山本はポケットから、ザラリと二枚のカミソリの刃を取り出し、手のひらに載せて見せるのだった。
その夜、真っ青な顔色で帰宅した松下君に幸子は泣いてすべてを告白した。すでに彼女は妊娠八ヶ月の身重になっていた。
山本のゆすりに応じなければ夫が脅かされ、度重なれば必ず夫に捨てられると思い込んだ幸子は、とうとう意を決して、山本の誘いに応じて、再び一年ぶりにカミソリの刃を握った。
阿倍野橋発の大阪市電の中で、久しぶりに山本とコンビになった幸子は、ある婦人の手提げ袋を狙った。汗を拭くと見せかけたハンカチの中に忍ばせた得意のカミソリの妙技。カーブを利用し――

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"If it is said that the doubt you hold toward me will be cleared, I will speak. You, about one month ago, inside a Keihin Line train, to a country-style old lady, must have offered your seat. That old lady carrying luggage was my mother. At that time, it was the way back from meeting my mother who came from the country, but it was exactly rush hour, and I became far separated from my mother. At that time, you who were sitting in front of my mother offered the seat to her. My mother, who came to Tokyo from the country for the first time, was happy at your kindness and asked your name, right? At that time, I was separated, but I was very happy. And I ended up remembering your name. While I was thinking of saying thanks, you got off at the next station..."

Haruo became ashamed that he doubted her even for a moment. I see, with that gratitude in mind, she treated me to a meal the day before yesterday.
"I accidentally doubted you, I am sorry. Please forgive me. For a distraction, shall we go somewhere and drink something cold?"
"Yes, let's go together."
He thought a beautiful woman like Utako could not possibly do bad things; thinking so, happiness surged up again.
However, the mysterious thing of the day before yesterday became a wisp of anxiety and stayed in the depths of his heart, giving him restless thoughts.
This path was, as usual, lively, filled with the melodies of popular songs.

"There is. There is."

How would Matsushita-kun notice that Sachiko, whom he meets in office-worker-style Western clothes, is a female pickpocket? As happy meetings overlapped and passion burned like fire, Sachiko finally, unable to bear it, begged Yamamoto with tears to let her "wash her feet" (quit) and break ties. But,
"Hmph, want to get married? Don't make me laugh. You, who ate the rice of a pickpocket for four years, there's no way you don't know which is more important: the duty to comrades or your own romance. To betray me, you must have that much resolve, right?"
Yamamoto's threat filled with bloodlust as he sneered coldly like a demon. Sachiko deeply realized the terrifying code of the pickpocket world.
But the affection for Matsushita-kun could not be cut. Threatened many times by Yamamoto, after desperately running around Osaka city, finally Sachiko formally married Matsushita-kun and managed a modest nest of love in a back alley of Minami-ku.
However, when Yamamoto discovered this hiding place, aiming for after Matsushita-kun went to work, he visited and extorted money. To her husband who knew nothing, a poor station hand husband, how could she confess the past of being a female pickpocket? Sachiko had no choice but to follow Yamamoto's demands, swallowing her tears. Sachiko, who ran out of money from frequent extortion, one day finally rejected Yamamoto's threat. The next day, Yamamoto nonchalantly visited Matsushita-kun at his subway workplace.
"Ehehe, your wife and I were partners in *this* in the past."
Hatefully, Yamamoto took two razor blades from his pocket with a clatter and showed them on his palm.
That night, to Matsushita-kun who returned home with a pale face, Sachiko cried and confessed everything. She was already eight months pregnant.
Believing that if she did not respond to Yamamoto's extortion, her husband would be threatened, and if it repeated, she would surely be abandoned, Sachiko finally made up her mind, responded to Yamamoto's invitation, and held a razor blade again for the first time in a year.
Inside an Osaka city tram departing from Abenobashi, Sachiko, paired with Yamamoto for the first time in a while, aimed at a lady's handbag. The skillful razor technique hidden inside a handkerchief used to pretend to wipe sweat. Utilizing the curve [of the tracks]—

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"If it will clear the suspicions you harbor against me, then I shall tell you everything. About a month ago, on a Keihin Line train, you gave up your seat to an elderly woman from the countryside, didn't you? That woman, burdened with luggage, was my mother. I had gone to meet her upon her arrival in Tokyo, and on our way back, the rush hour crowds separated us. You happened to be sitting right in front of her and offered her your seat. It was her first time in the city, and she was so moved by your kindness that she asked for your name. Though I was watching from a distance, I was so happy that I committed your name to memory. I wanted to thank you myself, but you had already stepped off at the next station..."

Haruo felt a sting of shame for having doubted her even for a second. So *that* was why she had treated him to such a fine meal the other day—it was an expression of her gratitude.
"I'm terribly sorry for misjudging you. Please, forgive me. Why don't we go somewhere to cool off and have a drink?" 
"I would be delighted," she replied.
Haruo looked at her, thinking that a woman as beautiful as Utako could never be capable of anything untoward. The thought filled him with a renewed sense of joy. Yet, the memory of that strange occurrence from two days ago remained like a thin veil of fog in the back of his mind, leaving him slightly unsettled. 
The street around them was as bustling as ever, the air thick with the melodies of the latest hit songs.

**IV**
"I have them. Right here."

How could Matsushita ever have guessed that Sachiko, who always met him dressed in the modest Western clothes of an office clerk, was actually a professional pickpocket? As their secret meetings grew more frequent and their passion intensified, Sachiko finally reached her breaking point. With tears streaming down her face, she begged her partner, Yamamoto, to let her go straight and sever their ties. 
But Yamamoto only sneered. "Hah! You want to get married? Don't make me laugh. You've spent four years eating the bread of a thief. You of all people should know which comes first: loyalty to your crew or some trivial romance. If you’re going to betray me, I hope you’re prepared for the consequences."
Faced with Yamamoto’s cold, demonic smirk and murderous aura, Sachiko was reminded of the ruthless "code" that governed the underworld.
Yet her love for Matsushita was too strong to break. Despite Yamamoto’s relentless threats, she spent months desperately evading him across Osaka until, at last, she and Matsushita were officially married. They built a modest "love nest" in a quiet back alley of the Minami Ward.
Their peace was short-lived. Yamamoto eventually tracked down their hideout. He began visiting the moment Matsushita left for work, extorting money from her. How could she ever tell the truth to her husband, a simple, hardworking station hand who knew nothing of her past? Sachiko had no choice but to suffer in silence and pay. When the money finally ran out, she found the courage to refuse him. The very next day, Yamamoto strolled into the subway station where Matsushita worked.
"Heh heh... your wife and I? We used to be partners in *this* business," he said with a malicious grin, pulling two razor blades from his pocket and letting them clatter onto his palm.
When Matsushita returned home that night, his face was ashen. Sachiko broke down and confessed everything. She was already eight months pregnant. 
Terrified that Yamamoto would keep harassing her husband—or that Matsushita would eventually leave her—Sachiko made a desperate choice. She agreed to Yamamoto's demands and, for the first time in a year, picked up the razor blade once again.
On an Osaka city tram departing from Abenobashi, Sachiko was back at work with Yamamoto. She set her sights on a woman's handbag. Using a handkerchief as a cover while pretending to wipe away sweat, she prepared her signature move with the razor, waiting for the tram to hit a sharp curve...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The page is divided into two distinct sections separated by a central illustration. The top half contains the conclusion of one scene (likely involving characters Haruo and Utako), while the bottom half begins a new chapter or subplot (marked by the numeral "四") involving the characters Sachiko and Yamamoto.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a traditional vertical orientation (*tategaki*). It employs *kyū-jitai* (pre-reform kanji) and *kyū-kana* (historical kana), which is characteristic of Japanese publishing prior to and immediately following WWII.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration serves as a visual anchor, depicting the dramatic tension between a man (Matsushita or Yamamoto) and a woman (Sachiko or Utako). The sketch-like, expressive style is typical of "pulp" or popular literary magazines of the era.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Section breaks are indicated by numerals (like "四"). The use of dashes (――) for trailing speech and specific punctuation for emphasis (like the "エヘヘ" for laughter) are standard for the period's narrative style.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s - Early 1950s):** The mention of "popular song melodies" (*ryūkyōka*) and the specific geography (Keihin Line in Tokyo, Abenobashi in Osaka) places the story in a post-war urban setting. The "office clerk" look versus the "pickpocket" reality reflects the social instability and class mixing of the era.
*   **The "Female Pickpocket" Trope:** In early 20th-century Japanese pulp fiction (*kasutori* magazines), the reformed criminal or the "woman with a past" was a common archetype, exploring themes of social redemption vs. the inescapable underworld.
*   **Razor Blades (Kamisori):** Before modern security, pickpockets frequently used small razor blades hidden in handkerchiefs or between fingers to slit bags and pockets silently. This "skill" was often romanticized or demonized in crime fiction.
*   **"Washing Feet" (Ashi o arau):** An idiom meaning to go straight or quit a life of crime, still used today but very common in yakuza and underworld narratives of this period.
*   **Social Class:** Matsushita is a "station hand" (*ekishu*), a modest but steady working-class job, contrasting with the parasitic nature of the blackmailer Yamamoto.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **妾 (Watashi/Warawa):** In this context, it is a feminine first-person pronoun. While it can mean "concubine," in older literature, it was a humble or feminine way for women to refer to themselves.
*   **スリ (Suri):** Pickpocket.
*   **仁義 (Jingi):** Underworld code of ethics/loyalty. Yamamoto uses it ironically to keep Sachiko trapped.
*   **合棒 (Aibō):** Partner/Accomplice. (Now usually written as 相棒).
*   **意を決して (I o kesshite):** To make up one's mind; to resolve to do something.
*   **妙技 (Myōgi):** Exquisite skill or masterly feat—here used for the dark art of pickpocketing.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Redemption and the "Past":** The central conflict for Sachiko is the impossibility of escaping her history. Despite her marriage and pregnancy (symbols of a "new life"), her criminal past is a physical weapon (the razor) used against her.
*   **Misjudgment based on Appearance:** In the first half, Haruo realizes Utako is "good" because of a misunderstanding. In the second half, Matsushita fails to see Sachiko is a "thief" because she looks like a respectable office worker. This highlights the post-war anxiety about identity and "who people really are."
*   **Blackmail and Gender:** Sachiko's vulnerability is tied to her domestic status and pregnancy. Yamamoto uses the patriarchal threat of being "abandoned by her husband" to force her back into crime.
*   **Urban Grittiness:** The contrast between the "love nest" in a back alley and the crowded trams/trains emphasizes the claustrophobic nature of urban life where one's past is never truly far away.
