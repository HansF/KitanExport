　と今更乍ら女の蕊の強さに感心した。浩の父は大きい息子があるのに、年甲斐もなく好女で、殆ど家に居る事がなく、腹違いの子が七八人はあろうという。母親は若い時からこの父に苦労をさせられ、更年期の意地悪いヒステリー女であつた爲、二十才の男女の甘さにこと／＼く目を光らした。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"...thought [it] so."
And [he] newly admired the strength of the woman’s core. Hiroshi's father, despite having a large son, was a womanizer regardless of age, and it was said there were seven or eight half-siblings. Because the mother was made to suffer by this father from a young age and was a spiteful hysterical woman in menopause, she kept a sharp eye on every bit of sweetness between the twenty-year-old man and woman.
"Hiroshi, a man is not a thing that stays home and sticks close by his wife’s side," she’d say, chasing him out, and then,
"Yasu-chan is lucky, isn't she? Hiroshi is always home for her—" she’d say full of irony. In the hands of this stingy mother who ran an inn without even using a maid, Yasuko, who had been allowed to be as selfish as she pleased until now, had her freedom completely stolen.

Washing had to be done every day. The guests were mostly black-market dealers and brokers coming from the countryside, who were regulars and brought their own rice. The mother-in-law appropriately skimmed off the top of that rice to supplement the house’s shortage. Yasuko, made to eat tasteless gruel and having to handle the reception of guests single-handedly, had no time to go see a movie with Hiroshi. Hiroshi, who was a robust man outside, was like a borrowed cat at home out of constraint toward his mother, which was entirely unexpected for her. Hiroshi was a child his father had sired with an outside woman.

He too was vaguely aware of that fact and simply couldn't stand up to his mother. In the meantime, Yasuko became pregnant, but deep in Hiroshi’s heart, the taste of a lewd woman he had known to escape the idea of death when he was in the Special Attack Forces had taken up residence. When her friend Asako came to visit, Yasuko, returning from an outing, the moment she opened the sliding door of the room, clearly saw a scene she should not have seen. The woman looked down in shame, and the man stood up, his face changing color. In that startled moment, Yasuko had delivered a violent slap to the man's cheek.
"I am going home," she said, flying out of the house in a daze, but Hiroshi chased after her.
"I beg you, don't go. I was wrong. I apologize. From now on, I will absolutely never do such a thing," he persuaded her fervently, and since he was the man she had loved and joined with originally, her strong-willed heart could not help but break.

One morning when she was six months pregnant, Yasuko’s physical condition was unusually strange.
"I wonder if I should go to a doctor," she said, to which,
"Doctors are just for-profit-ists; they'll pin some disease or other on you to take your money," the mother-in-law said with a blatantly displeased face, so she helplessly went to bed early that day, but that night, she had severe bleeding.

"Hiroshi-san, it's terrible!" at that cry, Hiroshi in a flurry put her on a bicycle and took her to the hospital, but it was already too late.
"Why didn't you come sooner?" the doctor scolded, and the miscarried child was a boy.
Yasuko went as far as being told she might be finished, but somehow her young life was saved, and she was discharged after about two months, but soon after that, the two of them had to attend the hospital together. She had received syphilis from Hiroshi and it had already entered the third stage. Her small round face with apple-like cheeks and small red lips had faded miserably.
"I haven't entered a bath for a month," she said to her friend Yoshiko, who lived near the hospital, showing her dirty feet.

Her voice had withered, and she spoke as if squeezing out a voice that wouldn't come. Yoshiko, seeing the extreme change, could not find the right words. Of her who had reigned among male and female friends as so carefree—what a decline.
"You mustn't overdo it. No matter what your mother-in-law says, your body comes first,"
"Even this is an improvement. Until recently, I couldn't walk. Boils appeared one after another on my backside, and they cut them all. Yoshiko-chan, it hurt,"
"You really endured such a thing,"
"I had Hiroshi-san put me on the bicycle to go to the hospital, but today it seemed like I could walk, so I stopped by your place for a change of pace,"
"Hiroshi-san is cruel, isn't he, infecting you with such a disease,"
"Speaking of him, even though he's the one who infected me, he says things like I did something bad and brought it from outside. Yoshiko-chan, I wonder if women become this weak once they marry,"
Watching her leave after pouring out her complaints, her back as she walked falteringly, her shoulders and waist were thin, and her body wearing red-striped serge looked elderly; that bursting youthfulness was nowhere to be seen.

"Is Yoshiko-chan here today?" Yasuko, who came two months after that, had a face so lively it was unrecognizable.
"Eh?"
"I've come back (to my parents' home)."
"I broke up with Hiroshi-san. There's no man as heartless as him. I hate him so much I want to make him a cripple,"
"It's good you came back. You're young, and if I think there's a prospect for you, it's better to return quickly. If you think old-fashionedly and dither, it's a loss for a lifetime,"
"Speaking of Hiroshi-san, he doesn't make any money at all, and I'm married yet have no pocket money; I feel I worked hard as a maid substitute. Yoshiko-chan, you only know me from when I was just playing around, so you might not believe me, but—I felt refreshed coming home. My mother also told me to come home that quickly.
I've gained one *kan* (3.75kg) since returning."

“...that’s what I thought.”
Even now, he couldn't help but marvel at the inner strength of women. Hiroshi’s father, despite having a grown son, was an incorrigible philanderer who was rarely home; it was rumored he had seven or eight children by different women. Hiroshi’s mother had been made to suffer by this man since her youth. Now a bitter, hysterical woman in the throes of menopause, she kept a hawk-like watch over any hint of affection between the young couple in their twenties.

“Hiroshi, a man has no business moping around the house stuck to his wife’s side!” she would bark, driving him out. Then, turning to Yasuko with dripping irony, she’d say, “You’re a lucky one, aren’t you, Yasu-chan? Hiroshi’s always here for you.” Yasuko had been a spoiled, headstrong girl before marrying into this house, but under the thumb of her mother-in-law—a stingy woman who ran an inn without even hiring a maid—her freedom was utterly stripped away.

The laundry was a daily, grueling chore. The guests were mostly black-market dealers and brokers from the countryside who brought their own rice. The mother-in-law would skim off a portion of the guests' rice to fill the holes in the family’s own rations. Fed on nothing but thin, tasteless gruel and forced to manage the guests alone, Yasuko never had a spare moment to see a movie with Hiroshi. To her surprise, the man who seemed so sturdy in the outside world was like a frightened cat at home, unable to stand up to his mother. Hiroshi, it turned out, was the child of his father’s mistress. He knew the truth of his birth and lived in perpetual submission to the woman who raised him.

Yasuko eventually became pregnant. Yet, deep in Hiroshi’s soul, there remained a lingering obsession with the "wanton women" he had sought out during the war to escape the looming shadow of death in the Special Attack Forces. One day, while her friend Asako was visiting, Yasuko returned home and slid open the door to find a scene that seared itself into her eyes. The woman looked away in shame; Hiroshi turned pale and stood up. In a flash of white-hot rage, Yasuko struck him across the face.

“I’m going home!” she cried, fleeing the house. Hiroshi chased her down, pleading, “Please don’t go! I was wrong, I’m sorry. I swear I’ll never do it again!” Faced with his desperate entreaties, Yasuko—who had married him for love—found her resolve crumbling.

Six months into her pregnancy, Yasuko woke up feeling terribly unwell. 
“I think I should see a doctor,” she ventured.
“Doctors are nothing but crooks,” her mother-in-law snapped, her face twisted in a scowl. “They just make up illnesses to bleed you dry.” Reluctantly, Yasuko went to bed early. That night, she suffered a violent hemorrhage.

“Hiroshi! Something’s wrong!” 
Panic-stricken by her screams, Hiroshi loaded her onto a bicycle and raced to the hospital. But it was too late. 
“Why didn't you bring her sooner?” the doctor barked. The child she lost was a boy.

Yasuko hovered on the brink of death, but her youth pulled her through. Two months later, she was discharged, but the ordeal was far from over. Both she and Hiroshi were forced to return for treatment; he had infected her with syphilis, which had already progressed to the third stage. Her once-round face, apple-red cheeks, and bright lips had faded into a ghostly pallor.
Stopping by the house of her friend Yoshiko near the hospital, Yasuko showed her her blackened, unwashed feet. “I haven't been able to take a bath in a month,” she rasped.

Her voice was a mere husk, every word a painful struggle. Yoshiko was speechless at the sight of her. Where was the girl who had once reigned so confidently over her circle of friends?
“You mustn't push yourself, Yasu-chan. No matter what that woman says, your health comes first.”
“This is actually me getting better,” Yasuko replied. “Until recently, I couldn't even walk. My backside was covered in boils... they had to cut them all out. It hurt so much, Yoshiko.”
“I can't believe you endured all that.”
“Hiroshi used to take me to the hospital on his bicycle, but I felt like I could walk today. I just needed to see you.”
“Hiroshi is a monster for giving you that disease.”
“And after he gave it to me, he has the nerve to say I must have been playing around and brought it home myself. Yoshiko... does marriage always make a woman this weak?”
As Yoshiko watched her friend walk away, she saw a trembling figure with thin shoulders and a wasted frame. In her striped serge kimono, Yasuko looked like an old woman. The vibrant girl she once was was gone.

Two months later, Yasuko appeared at Yoshiko’s door again. This time, her face was glowing.
“Yasu-chan?”
“I’m back. For good.”
“You left Hiroshi?”
“I did. I’ve never known a man so cold-hearted. I hate him enough to want to see him broken.”
“I’m so glad you’re back. You’re still young—it’s better to get out now than to waste your life clinging to old-fashioned ideas of duty.”
“Hiroshi never made any money, and I never had a cent of my own. I was nothing but a maid to them. You remember how I used to be, Yoshiko—always playing, never working—so you might not believe me, but I worked myself to the bone. It feels like a weight has been lifted. My mother even told me I should have come home sooner. I’ve already gained nearly four kilos since I got back!”

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a three-column vertical orientation, typical of Japanese magazines (*zasshi*). The page number "21" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard mid-century Mincho. Notable is the use of iteration marks like 「こと／＼く」(kotogotoku) and 「はつ／＼」(hatsuhatsu), though the latter is more commonly 「うす／＼」(usu-usu) in this text.
*   **Visual Elements:** A small, simple line-art illustration of a traditional Japanese roof/house appears at the top right, likely acting as a decorative chapter header or a scene-setting motif.
*   **Structure:** The story moves from a descriptive third-person narrative (setting the scene of the abusive household) into a dialogue-heavy dramatic climax and resolution.
*   **Punctuation:** Uses traditional Japanese quotation marks (「 」) and iteration marks. The use of small kana (like っ, ょ) is consistent with post-WWII orthography reforms, though some older kanji forms (like 「變」 for 「変」) are still present, suggesting a transition period.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Hardship (Late 1940s):** The mention of "Yami-ya" (black-market dealers) and "brokers" bringing their own rice reflects the severe food shortages and the collapse of the official rationing system after WWII. Families often stayed afloat by skimming food from guests.
*   **The Shadow of the War:** Hiroshi's infidelity and "lewdness" are explicitly linked to his time in the *Tokkōtai* (Special Attack Forces/Kamikaze). This psychological trauma—using hedonism to cope with the imminent threat of death—was a common theme in "Buraiha" (Decadent School) literature of the era.
*   **Medical Context (Syphilis):** Before the widespread availability of penicillin in Japan (which began in the late 40s but took time to reach everyone), syphilis was a terrifying and stigmatized disease. "Third stage" (三期) syphilis involves severe internal and external lesions (the "boils" described).
*   **Family Dynamics:** The "Shitome" (mother-in-law) vs. "Yome" (daughter-in-law) conflict is a classic trope, but here it is intensified by the economic desperation of the era. The mother-in-law's rejection of doctors as "money-grubbers" reflects a common distrust/inability to afford professional healthcare at the time.
*   **Social Morality:** The ending, where the protagonist leaves her husband and is welcomed back by her mother, reflects a budding "modern" sentiment in post-war popular fiction—prioritizing individual survival and health over traditional "endure at all costs" (gaman) marital expectations.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ヤミ屋 (Yami-ya):** Black-market dealers. Essential but legally "shady" figures in the post-war economy.
*   **上前をはねる (Uwa-mae o haneru):** To take a cut or skim off the top.
*   **借りて来た猫 (Karite kita neko):** "A borrowed cat." An idiom for someone who is unusually quiet and well-behaved because they are in an unfamiliar or intimidating environment.
*   **特攻隊 (Tokkōtai):** Special Attack Forces (Kamikaze).
*   **三期 (Sanki):** The third stage of syphilis, characterized by "gummas" (soft, non-cancerous growths/boils).
*   **セル (Seru):** From "serge," a type of durable wool fabric often used for kimonos or school uniforms in that era.
*   **一貫目 (Ikkanme):** A traditional unit of weight equal to 3.75 kg (8.27 lbs).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Toxicity of Tradition:** The mother-in-law represents the "old" Japan—stingy, suspicious of modern medicine, and abusive toward the younger generation.
*   **Gender and Power:** Yasuko ponders if marriage inherently makes women weak. Her eventual recovery and "fattening up" after leaving Hiroshi serves as a metaphor for regaining her soul and agency.
*   **War Trauma:** Hiroshi’s inability to be a "good husband" is rooted in his wartime experience. His promiscuity is a scar of the war, which he then inflicts physically on Yasuko through disease.
*   **The "Kasutori" Tone:** This text fits the "Kasutori" magazine style—cheap, sensationalist literature that mixed melodrama, social issues (disease/poverty), and a touch of the erotic/sordid to appeal to the weary post-war public.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story/Serial)
*   **Genre:** Melodrama, Social Realism (*Shishōsetsu* style)
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Domestic Abuse, Syphilis, Infidelity, Miscarriage, Divorce, Black Market, War Trauma.
