俺はなア、此頃ちょつと宗旨変えたる思うてんね。太う暮らすのも、細う暮らすのも、同じ世の中。俺もグズグズしてたら六十に手が届く。直き死んでしまうんや。死ななん間に、うんとうまいもん食べて、好きな女子を抱いてえ、事しとかんといつ閻魔はんからお迎えがくるかわかれへん。俺はこないに考えたんや。亀！ 強盗でも何でもやろやないか？」
「あッあッほー！ なツなんかしやがるねん！ ようもく〜そんなあはたれが云えたもんやな。今日こそ辛抱出来ん。どんな事があつても出て行つて貰う。なぐるならなぐれ！ 何ぼでもなぐらしたるさかい。お前にはあいそもこそもついた！」
亀の絶叫に、虎は例の目をギョロリと光らせたが、不思議におとなしく立上つた。
「そうか。それなら別れたろ。その方が俺にもえゝ。お前みたいな意久地無しといつしよにおるのん、えゝ加減飽いたわい！」
虎は小屋ん中へ入つて、暫らくゴソゴソしておる様子だつたが、亀は知らない振りをしていた。虎はそつぽを向いている亀を見ると、チェッと舌打して、その儘裏道づたいに消えた。
亀は晴々とした気持になつてお絹さんの干していつた干物台を眺める、湯文字、シャツ、じゅばん、むつきなどが、風にへんぽんとひるがえる。亀は次第にゆかいとなつて来た。俺が一人で此処におるのなれば、何も心配はない。思えば虎の奴め、随分俺を苦しめやがつた。が、もう大丈夫や。元通りの俺の天下に戻つたんや。亀は両手をあげて万歳を叫びたい気持だつた。
と裏木戸が開いて、再びお絹さんが出て来た。亀の足はバネ仕掛のように立上ると、はやお絹さんの身近に駈け下りていた。
「御りよんさん！ 虎が去にました！ もゝあの小屋に居りまへん……」
乾いたむつきを持つて帰りかけたお絹さんは、感動した面持で、まアそウ……と答えて呉れたのが、亀にはとても嬉しかつた。
「これ、虎さん去んだお祝だす……」と笑いながら云つて、お絹さんが木戸の合間から呉れた紙包には、赤と白の大きな嫁入まんじゅうが三つも包んであつた。
亀は空腹のまゝ、そのまんじゅうを二つ迄喰べた。一つは晩の楽しみに残しておこう。亀は一つになつたまんじゅうを大切に包み直して小屋の隅においた。そしてごろりと横になると、急に疲れが出たのか、ぐぅ〜と高いびきだつた。

「俺はなあ、この頃ちょっと宗旨変えたろ思うてんねん。太く暮らすのも、細く暮らすのも、同じ世の中。俺もグズグズしてたら六十に手が届く。じき死んでしまうんや。死なない間に、うんとうまいもん食べて、好きな女子（おなご）を抱いて、ということをしておかないと、いつ閻魔はんからお迎えが来るか分かれへん。俺はこう考えたんや。亀！ 強盗でも何でもやろうやないか！」
「あ、あ、あほー！ 何をぬかしやがるねん！ よくもまあ、そんな阿呆（あはたれ）が言えたもんやな。今日こそ辛抱できん。どんなことがあっても出て行ってもらう。殴るなら殴れ！ 何ぼでも殴らしたるさかい。お前には愛想も小想も尽きた！」
亀の絶叫に、虎は例の目をギョロリと光らせたが、不思議に大人しく立ち上がった。
「そうか。それなら別れたろ。その方が俺にもええ。お前みたいな意気地なしと一緒に居るの、ええ加減飽きたわい！」
虎は小屋の中へ入って、しばらくゴソゴソしている様子だったが、亀は知らない振りをしていた。虎はそっぽを向いている亀を見ると、チェッと舌打ちして、そのまま裏道伝いに消えた。
亀は晴れ晴れとした気持ちになって、お絹さんの干していった干物台を眺める。湯文字（ゆもじ）、シャツ、襦袢（じゅばん）、襁褓（むつき）などが、風に翻（へんぽん）とひるがえる。亀は次第に愉快となってきた。「俺が一人でここに居るのなれば、何も心配はない。思えば虎の奴め、随分俺を苦しめやがった。が、もう大丈夫や。元通りの俺の天下に戻ったんや」。亀は両手を挙げて万歳を叫びたい気持ちだった。
と裏木戸が開いて、再びお絹さんが出てきた。亀の足はバネ仕掛けのように立ち上がると、はやお絹さんの身近に駆け下りていた。
「お絹さん！ 虎が去（い）にました！ もうあの小屋に居りまへん……」
乾いた襁褓を持って帰りかけたお絹さんは、感動した面持ちで、「まあそう……」と答えてくれたのが、亀にはとても嬉しかった。
「これ、虎さんが去（い）んだお祝いです……」と笑いながら言って、お絹さんが木戸の合間からくれた紙包みには、赤と白の大きな嫁入り饅頭が三つも包んであった。
亀は空腹のまま、その饅頭を二つまで食べた。一つは晩の楽しみに残しておこう。亀は一つになった饅頭を大切に包み直して小屋の隅に置いた。そしてごろりと横になると、急に疲れが出たのか、ぐうーと高いびきだった。

While not dead, plenty tasty things eat, liked woman hug, such things not doing, when King Enma-san's welcome comes [I] don't know. Me, this way thought. Kame! Robbery or anything, let's do [it]!"
"A-A-Idiot! What [are you] saying! How well such a scoundrel can say [that]. Today surely patience not possible. Whatever happens, go out [I] will have [you]. If hit, hit! However much [I] will let [you] hit [me]. Of you, affection and small-affection reached [the end]!"
At Kame's scream, Tora made usual eyes roll-glint, but strangely quietly stood up.
"Is that so. Then [I] will separate. That way for me too good. With spineless-thing like you together being, quite bored [I am]!"
Tora into hut entered, for a while rummaging-rummaging state was, but Kame did not-know pretense was doing. Tora, at looking-away Kame seeing, "Tsk" tongue-clicked, and as-it-is back-path along disappeared.
Kame clear-clear feeling became, O-kin-san's hung-up drying-rack looked at. Loincloths, shirts, under-robes, diapers, etc., in wind fluttering-fluttering waved. Kame gradually pleasant became. "If I alone here am, nothing worry is. Thinking [of it], Tora fellow, considerably me made suffer. But, already okay. Original-way my kingdom returned." Kame both hands raised, "Banzai" want-to-shout feeling was.
And back-gate opened, again O-kin-san came out. Kame's legs like spring-mechanism stood up, already O-kin-san's vicinity to ran down.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Listen, Kame, I’ve been thinking of changing my ways lately. Whether you live large or eke out a meager existence, it’s all the same world in the end. If I keep dawdling like this, I’ll be sixty before I know it. Death is just around the corner. If I don't eat my fill of good food and hold a woman I like while I'm still breathing, who knows when King Enma will come to fetch me? That's my conclusion. So Kame, what do you say? Let's try our hand at robbery—or anything else!"

"You... you absolute moron! What the hell are you talking about? How can a lowlife like you even say such a thing? My patience has finally run out. I don't care what happens, you’re getting out of here today. If you want to hit me, go ahead! I’ll let you hit me as much as you want. I’m utterly finished with you!"

At Kame’s outburst, Tora’s eyes gave their usual menacing roll, but strangely, he stood up without a fight.

"Fine. I’ll leave. It’s better for me anyway. I’m sick and tired of being stuck with a spineless coward like you!"

Tora went inside the hut and rummaged around for a while, while Kame pretended not to notice. When Tora saw Kame looking away, he clicked his tongue in annoyance and disappeared down the back path.

A sense of relief washed over Kame as he gazed at the laundry rack where O-kin had hung her things. Loincloths, shirts, undergarments, and diapers fluttered brightly in the breeze. Kame’s spirits began to lift. *If it's just me here, I have nothing to worry about. Thinking back, that bastard Tora really made my life miserable. But it’s okay now. My world is back to the way it should be.* Kame felt like throwing his hands up and shouting "Banzai!"

Just then, the back gate opened and O-kin appeared again. Kame sprang to his feet as if moved by a hidden mechanism and rushed down to her side.

"O-kin-san! Tora is gone! He’s not in the hut anymore!"

O-kin, who was about to head home with her dry diapers, looked moved. "Oh, is that so..." she replied, and her response made Kame incredibly happy.

"Here, this is to celebrate Tora-san's departure," she said with a smile. She handed him a paper parcel through the gap in the gate; inside were three large red-and-white wedding manju.

Starving as he was, Kame devoured two of them immediately. He decided to save the last one as a treat for the evening. He carefully re-wrapped the remaining manju and tucked it into a corner of the hut. As he stretched out on the floor, his exhaustion suddenly caught up with him, and before long, he was snoring loudly.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard mid-20th-century serif typeface used in magazines. Kanji usage includes some older forms (e.g., "喰べた" for "食べた," "去にました" for "行きました/去りました").
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The story title is located at the bottom left within a stylized block: **「銃火」(Jūka)**. The artist's signature, **「芳光」(Yoshimitsu)**, is visible at the bottom of the illustration.
*   **Illustration:** The artwork occupies a significant portion of the upper-left quadrant. It depicts a woman (O-kin) in a kimono and a man (Kame) in a short jacket (*happi* or similar) and a loincloth-like wrap. The style is reminiscent of "E-monogatari" (illustrated stories) popular in the 1940s and 50s.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "(30)" is centered at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The language and setting suggest the early post-war period in Japan. Life was difficult, and the dialogue reflects a struggle between surviving through crime (Tora's suggestion) versus maintaining dignity through honest poverty (Kame's choice).
*   **Kansai Dialect:** The characters speak a strong Kansai/Osaka-style dialect. Phrases like "宗旨変えたる" (changing principles), "あはたれ" (fool/worthless person), and "去（い）にました" (went away) are characteristic of this region's historical colloquialisms.
*   **Enma-han (King Enma):** In Japanese Buddhism, Enma is the judge of the dead. Mentioning him reflects the character's fatalistic view of life.
*   **Yumoji and Mutsuki:** "Yumoji" are traditional wrap-around underskirts for women, and "mutsuki" are cloth diapers. Seeing these fluttering in the wind signifies a return to peaceful, mundane domesticity.
*   **Wedding Manju (嫁入まんじゅう):** Large red and white steamed buns are traditional celebratory gifts in Japan. In a time of post-war food scarcity, receiving three of these was a significant and generous gift.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **宗旨 (Shūshi):** Originally a religious sect, but used here colloquially to mean one's life principles or "philosophy."
*   **あはたれ (Ahatare):** An archaic or dialectal insult for a worthless person, a scoundrel, or a "good-for-nothing."
*   **意久地無し (Ikujinashi):** Spineless, cowardly, or lacking in spirit.
*   **へんぽん (Henpon):** Onomatopoeic/mimetic word (翻) describing something fluttering or waving vigorously in the wind.
*   **去（い）ぬ (Inu):** A dialectal verb meaning "to go" or "to leave." Here it is used in the past tense "去んだ" (inda) and "去にました" (inimashita).
*   **愛想も小想も尽きた (Aiso mo koso mo tsukita):** A set phrase meaning "to be utterly disgusted with someone" or "to have lost all patience/affection."

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Ethics of Poverty:** The central conflict is between Tora’s desire to resort to crime ("robbery") to enjoy life before he dies, and Kame’s refusal to follow that path. It mirrors the social chaos and moral dilemmas of post-war Japan.
*   **Freedom and Territory:** Kame refers to the hut as his "kingdom" (天下) once the overbearing Tora leaves. The theme of reclaiming one's space and peace is prominent.
*   **Simple Pleasures:** The narrative shifts from a tense argument to the quiet joy of watching laundry and eating a sweet bun. This highlights the resilience of the human spirit—finding happiness in small, honest things.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** O-kin is depicted as a provider of comfort and reward. Her presence and her laundry symbolize the "normalcy" Kame craves.
