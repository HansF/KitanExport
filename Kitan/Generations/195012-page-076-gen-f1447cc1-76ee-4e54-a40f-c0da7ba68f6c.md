あいつに脊負わせてやろうぢやないか、とか、仕事の合間の猥談がはづむのは、きまつて獵談がはづむ。
　村人の観念が、私通姦通を娯樂視し、日常茶事化し、つまんでも、つままれても、当人は勿論、周囲の者も意に介しないと言う、驚歎すべき状態に固定化しておつた。
　生徒数五百人足らずの小学校の、数少い教育官の一人として、もはや校長になる年配の、危い職逃れの策として入り込んだ信夫氏は、汚れたる兒童達に対して、あまりに還境の不潔性な多きを憂慮していた。

　こゝいらの村人達は他人の家を覗き込んだり、隙見したりするのは、當替である。三十六才と言え、年増盛りのヒサ子夫人の仇姿が、淫獣達の好餌であるは言う迄もない。誰一人居ない忍山の天神で、万ヶ一、彼等の手にかゝれば、妻は好餌となつてしまうだろう。
　もう秋で、四辺の空氣は冷や～とするのだが、信夫氏は額に汗をかいた。腕捲り、裾はしよつて、馴れぬ山道をいそいだ。土質が赤泥岩で構成されていて、大小の岩が所々凸出していて、信夫氏はそいつによく蹴ッつまづいた。
「こりやア不味かつた。下駄なんかぢや、無理だ。」
　空は晴れて、無数の星だ。その星明りで、どうやらこうやら道も辿れる。
　四十段階の石段をあがり切ると、鳥居がある。本殿の前に黒い影がしやがんでいる。妻だ。
『ヒサ子。』……俺もきたぞと言いかけて、そいつは呑み込んだ。
『まあ！　あなた……』
　彼女は白い顔を見せて近寄つてきた。
『あなたも、いっしよにお詣りして下さる気になつた？……』
「バカア俺はそんなんぢやない。只、お前の身が氣掛かりで……」と言うのが、本心だつたが、
『いや。山道は危険だからな。お前。足をどうもしなかつたか？』
『二度も三度もこけちやつたわ。親指どうかなつてるかしら？』
　ヒサ子は、石段に腰をおろすと、星明りの方へ、足を持ち上げてみせた。
『どれ、もつとよくお見せよ。』
　信夫氏も踞んで、自分の膝の上へ、彼女のボテ〜としたふくらはぎを乗せた。彼女は全てを夫に任していた。
『血が出ている。お前ハンケチか何か……』
　ハンケチを引き裂いて、信夫氏は手当を終つた。ふと見ると、妻の裾前が、膝頭から内股の奥の方迄、乱れを見せて、夜目にも白いその豊満性が、非常な誘惑で持つて、信夫氏へ迫つてきた。妻は両手を後ろへついて、星空を仰いでいる。妻なりにロマンチックな事を空想しているのだろう。信夫氏は妻の内股を二三度ピチヤ〜叩いて、彼女を引き起こした。
　ヒサ子は足を負傷しているので、おくれ勝だつた。信夫氏は腕を貸さねばならなかつた。
　星の見えない、暗い樹の間道に差しかかると、信夫氏は幾分口籠もつて言つた。
『お前。どうして丸ッ裸になんだ？いかんぢやないか！』
『でも、下のお安ツんさんが、丸ッ裸でないと、利き目が無いんですッて……』
『バカな！　ぜつたいにいけない！　そんなフシグラを好くのは助平神様なんだ！』
　信夫氏は先刻からメラ〜とした青い炎が、頭の突きから、足の踵まで、走り上り走り下りして、何とも言えん焦燥感に襲われていた。彼は、女房のこの腕を、必要以上に強く掴みしめて、容赦なくグイ〜引つぱつた。脇の下のハツ口がピリリッと裂ける。
　ヒサ子は夫の爲すが儘となつていた。

四
　ヒサ子は、昨夜の夫の猛獣性を想起して、ニンマリ鏡の中へ笑つてみせた。ドガの描いたマヤ夫人のような、大きくて美しい乳房が鏡へ映つている。そこへ、上の熊爺さんが、案内もなく這入つてきた。
　彼女は丁度、髪をつかねようとしていた矢先なので、そその儘だつた。爺さんは、早掘り芋のはいつた籠をブラさげながら、不遠慮に彼女の乳房を凝視した。なめるような目付だつた。彼女は赧くなりながら、手早く髪をつかねるとそくさに肌を入れた。
『奥さん。子供を生まんと、肌はきれいなもんぢやのう……』
　熊爺は、涎を手の甲でふいた。
『奥さん。子生れ祈願に、天神さんへお詣りしてるちゅうでねえか。下のお安が言つたつたで。さけやア、ゆうべは旦那も御座らしたちゅうこっちゃが、且つ（ママ）くがついていつちやア効験は無えだ。一人で行きなせえ。二人で行くなんで、今迄にそんな例は無え。今夜から一人でおいでなせえよ。』
　爺はそんな事を一人で口走りながら、目は相不変なめまわすような視線で、ヒサ子の全身を撫で回すのだつた。ヒサ子は何故か汗ばむ思いだつた。
　この爺さんは、ヒサ子の家の上手の芋畑のあつち側に、細い山道がある。その傍の農家の隠居であつたが、戦時中出征した孫の女房に手を出したり、麦畑の中で後家さんを抑え込んだりした経歴の有る其の道の強者だつた。
　腰は少し曲つているが、皺だらけながら、腕と言い、脛と言い、頑丈で骨太だつた。殊にその掌の大きな事は、ヒサ子に、都会の動物園で見たことのある熊の掌を思わせるのである。名から熊爺さんと言うのは、本名が熊吉としても、実にピツタリあてはまる。村人中の獣人として、此の七十才の老爺が、相当な地位を……（77）

「あいつに背負わせてやろうじゃないか」とか、仕事の合間の猥談がはずむのは、きまって猟談（かりの話）がはずむ時だ。
　村人の観念が、不倫や密通を娯楽視し、日常茶飯事化しており、つまんでも、つままれても、当人はもちろん周囲の者も意に介さないという、驚嘆すべき状態に固定化していた。
　生徒数五百人足らずの小学校の、数少ない教育官の一人として、もはや校長になる年配の、危うい職逃れの策として入り込んだ信夫氏は、汚れた子供たちに対して、あまりに環境の不潔な部分が多いことを憂慮していた。

　この辺りの村人たちは他人の家を覗き込んだり、隙見したりするのは当然のことだ。三十六歳とはいえ、年増盛りのヒサ子夫人の艶姿が、淫獣たちの格好の餌食であることは言うまでもない。誰一人いない忍山の天神で、万が一彼らの手にかかれば、妻は餌食となってしまうだろう。
　もう秋で、辺りの空気はひんやりとするのだが、信夫氏は額に汗をかいた。腕まくりをし、裾をはしょって、慣れぬ山道を急いだ。土質が赤泥岩で構成されていて、大小の岩が所々に突き出ており、信夫氏はそれによく蹴つまずいた。
「こりゃあまずかった。下駄なんかじゃ、無理だ」
　空は晴れて、無数の星だ。その星明かりで、どうにかこうにか道も辿れる。

「でも、下のお安さんが、丸裸でないと効き目がないって……」
「馬鹿な！　絶対にいけない！　そんな迷信（フシグラ）を好むのは助平神様なんだ！」
　信夫氏は先刻からメラメラとした青い炎が、頭の先から足の踵まで走り回り、何とも言えない焦燥感に襲われていた。彼は女房の腕を必要以上に強く掴んで、容赦なくグイと引っ張った。脇の下の袖口がピリリと裂ける。

　彼女はちょうど髪を束ねようとしていたところだったので、そのままの姿だった。爺さんは、早掘り芋の入った籠をぶら下げながら、遠慮なく彼女の胸を凝視した。舐めるような目つきだった。彼女は赤くなりながら、手早く髪をまとめると急いで服を着た。
「奥さん。子供を産まないと、肌はきれいなもんだなあ……」
　熊爺は、よだれを手の甲で拭いた。
「奥さん。子宝祈願に天神さんへお詣りしてるそうじゃないか。下のお安が言っていたよ。だけど、昨夜は旦那も一緒だったそうだが、くっついて行っちゃあ効き目はないぞ。一人で行きなさい。二人で行くなんて、今までにそんな例はない。今夜からは一人でおいでなさいよ」

III
"Why don't we make that guy carry it on his back?" and such, lewd talk between work breaks always gets lively whenever hunting talk gets lively.
The villagers' concept regarded adultery and secret affairs as entertainment, making them a matter of daily routine; even if one seduced or was seduced, the person themselves, and of course those around them, remained in a state of stunning indifference.
Mr. Nobuo, who had entered as one of the few educational officials in an elementary school with fewer than 500 students, as a measure to escape his precarious job at an age where he should be a principal, was worried about the extreme filthiness of the environment for the dirty children.

For the villagers around here, peeping into others' houses or glancing through gaps is a matter of course. Though thirty-six years old, it goes without saying that the alluring figure of Mrs. Hisako, in the prime of her years, is a fine bait for the "lascivious beasts." At the deserted Oshiyama Tenjin shrine, if by any chance she fell into their hands, she would surely become their prey.
It was already autumn, and the surrounding air was chilly, but Mr. Nobuo had sweat on his forehead. Rolling up his sleeves and tucking up his hem, he hurried along the unfamiliar mountain path. The soil was composed of red mudstone, with large and small rocks protruding here and there, and Mr. Nobuo frequently tripped over them.
"This was a bad idea. With clogs (geta), it’s impossible."
The sky was clear with countless stars. By that starlight, he could somehow follow the path.
After climbing the forty stone steps, there was a torii gate. In front of the main shrine, a black shadow was crouching. It was his wife.
"Hisako"... He started to say "I've come too," but swallowed the words.
"Oh! Dear..."
She showed her white face and approached.
"Did you also feel like coming to pray with me?..."
"Idiot, I’m not like that. It's just that I was worried about you..." that was his true heart, but—
"No. The mountain path is dangerous. You. Did you do something to your leg?"
"I tumbled two or three times. I wonder if something happened to my big toe?"
Hisako sat on the stone steps and lifted her leg toward the starlight.
"Let me see. Let me see it better."
Mr. Nobuo also crouched down and placed her plump calf on his own knee. She left everything to her husband.
"It's bleeding. You, a handkerchief or something..."
Tearing a handkerchief, Nobuo finished the first aid. Suddenly looking, his wife's hem was disarrayed from the kneecap to the inner thigh; that white fullness even in the night eyes became a great temptation and pressed upon Nobuo. His wife had both hands behind her, looking up at the starry sky. In her own way, she was probably dreaming of something romantic. Nobuo slapped her inner thigh twice or thrice with a "picha~" sound and pulled her up.
Because Hisako had injured her leg, she tended to lag behind. Nobuo had to lend his arm.
Upon reaching the dark path between trees where stars were invisible, Nobuo said somewhat hesitantly:
"You. Why are you becoming Stark Naked? That's no good!"
"But, Mr. Oyasu down there said that if I'm not Stark Naked, there's no effect..."
"Stupid! Absolutely no good! Only a lecherous god would like such a superstition (fushigura)!"
From a while ago, a flaring blue flame had been running from the top of Nobuo's head to his heels, and he was attacked by an indescribable sense of irritation. He gripped his wife's arm more strongly than necessary and pulled mercilessly. The armhole of her sleeve ripped with a "piriri" sound.
Hisako remained as her husband willed.

IV
Hisako, recalling her husband's beast-like nature of last night, gave a smirk into the mirror. Like the Madame Maya painted by Degas, her large and beautiful breasts were reflected in the mirror. Just then, Kumajī (Old Man Bear) from "up there" crawled in without an invitation.
She was exactly at the point of trying to gather her hair, so she was as she was. The old man, dangling a basket containing early-harvested potatoes, stared without reservation at her breasts. It was a licking sort of look. While turning red, she quickly gathered her hair and hurriedly put on her clothes.
"Madam. When you don't give birth to children, the skin stays beautiful, doesn't it..."
Kumajī wiped his drool with the back of his hand.
"Madam. They say you're going to Tenjin-san to pray for a child. Oyasu down there told me. Well, last night the Master was there too, but going together brings a 'curse' (clinging) and it won't work. Go alone. Don't go as two; there's never been such an example until now. From tonight, come alone."
While the old man muttered such things to himself, his eyes, with the same licking gaze as before, stroked all over Hisako's body. For some reason, Hisako felt like she was breaking into a sweat.
This old man lived in a farmhouse near the narrow mountain path on the other side of the potato field above Hisako's house; he was a "veteran" in that field, having a history of laying hands on his grandson's wife who went to war and pinning down a widow in a wheat field.
His back was slightly bent, but though covered in wrinkles, his arms and shins were sturdy and big-boned. Especially the largeness of his palms made Hisako remember the bear's paws she had seen at a city zoo. Being called Kumajī because of his name (even if his real name was Kumakichi) was truly a perfect fit. As a beast-man among the villagers, this seventy-year-old man held a considerable position...

**III**
In the village, talk of work inevitably shifted into ribald jokes, just as naturally as stories of the hunt. To these people, infidelity and illicit affairs were mere entertainment—daily trifles that caused no scandal. Whether one was the seducer or the seduced, it mattered little to the individuals involved or the neighbors who watched. This state of affairs had become a localized, startling social norm.

Nobuo was one of the few educated men in a small primary school of fewer than five hundred students. Having taken the post as a late-career refuge to escape professional instability, he frequently worried about the moral "filth" of the environment surrounding his grubby young pupils.

In this hamlet, peering into a neighbor's home was a common pastime. At thirty-six, Hisako was in the full bloom of womanhood, and her alluring figure was an obvious target for the village’s "lustful beasts." Nobuo feared that if she were caught alone at the deserted Oshiyama Shrine, she would surely fall prey to them.

Though the autumn air was turning crisp, sweat beaded on Nobuo’s brow. He rolled up his sleeves and hiked up his kimono hem, hurrying along a mountain path he had not yet mastered. The ground was composed of slippery red mudstone, punctuated by jagged rocks that caught his feet.
"This was a mistake," he muttered. "I can't navigate this in wooden geta."
The sky was clear, studded with a thousand stars. By their faint glow, he managed to find his way. At the top of forty stone steps stood a torii gate. A dark shadow crouched before the main hall. It was his wife.
"Hisako," he started to call out, intending to say he had come for her, but he held his tongue.
"Oh! It’s you..." she said, her pale face turning toward him as she approached. "Did you decide to come and pray with me after all?"
"Don’t be silly. I’m not here for that. I was just worried about you," he thought, but instead said, "No, the path is dangerous at night. Are you alright? Did you hurt yourself?"
"I fell a few times. I think I did something to my toe."
Hisako sat on the stone steps and lifted her leg into the starlight.
"Let me see," Nobuo said, crouching. He rested her heavy calf on his knee. She surrendered herself to his care. "You're bleeding. Do you have a handkerchief?"
Nobuo tore a cloth to bind the wound. Suddenly, he noticed her hem had fallen open, revealing her thighs deep into the shadows. Even in the dim light, the sight of her pale, ample flesh was an overwhelming temptation. Hisako leaned back on her hands, gazing romantically at the stars, lost in her own thoughts. Nobuo gave her inner thigh a sharp, playful slap and pulled her to her feet.

As they walked back through the lightless woods, Nobuo spoke with a hesitant, muffled voice.
"Why on earth would you go naked? That’s indecent!"
"But Oyasu told me the prayer wouldn't work unless I was completely naked..."
"Ridiculous! I won't hear of it! Only a lecherous god would demand such a thing!"
A flickering blue flame of agitation had been racing through Nobuo's veins since they met. He gripped his wife’s arm with unnecessary force, pulling her along. The fabric under her arm gave way with a sharp rip. Hisako offered no resistance, letting her husband lead her as he pleased.

**IV**
The next morning, Hisako caught her own reflection in the mirror and smirked, remembering her husband’s "beastly" vigor from the night before. Her breasts, as large and shapely as those of the "Maja" painted by Degas, were reflected clearly. Suddenly, old Kumajī from the neighboring house let himself in without a word.
Hisako was in the middle of pinning up her hair, leaving her upper body exposed. The old man, carrying a basket of freshly dug potatoes, stared shamelessly at her chest with a look that seemed to lick her skin. Blushing, she finished her hair and threw on her clothes.
"My, Madam," the old man rasped, wiping drool with the back of his hand. "Skin stays so lovely when you haven't had any brats..."
"I heard from Oyasu that you're praying at the shrine for a child," Kumajī continued. "The Master went with you last night, didn't he? That’s no good. If you go together, the 'clinging' spirit will spoil the blessing. You have to go alone. No one ever succeeds going as a pair. From tonight, you go by yourself."
As he prattled on, his eyes continued to roam over Hisako's body with a tactile intensity that made her break into a cold sweat. 
This old man was a retired farmer who lived by the mountain path. He was notorious in the village—a "veteran" of lechery who had famously laid hands on his own grandson's wife while the boy was at war, and who had once pinned a widow down in a wheat field. 
Though seventy and slightly stooped, his limbs were thick and powerful. His massive hands reminded Hisako of the paws of a bear she had seen at the zoo. Whether his name was Kumakichi or not, the nickname "Kumajī" (Old Man Bear) suited him perfectly. Among the villagers, he held a certain status as a primal, beast-like figure...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), which is standard for Japanese literature. The page is divided into two main sections (marked III and IV), indicating a serialized narrative.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. It uses a mix of *kyū-kanji* (traditional characters) and some simplified forms, suggesting a transitional period in Japanese orthography (post-1946 but pre-modernization).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The header at the top is enclosed in a decorative border with the words "Variety" (バラエティー) in katakana, signaling that this is part of a magazine's entertainment section rather than a serious literary journal.
*   **Pagination:** The page number (77) is centered at the bottom in parentheses.
*   **Design Features:** The use of furigana is minimal, suggesting the target audience was literate adults. Onomatopoeia (like ピチヤ〜 for a slap or ピリリッ for tearing cloth) is used to add sensory detail.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Late 1940s-1950s):** This was the era of "Kasutori" culture in Japan—cheap, mass-produced magazines that often featured stories with "erotic, grotesque, and nonsensical" (*ero-guro-nansensu*) themes. The mix of rural superstition and sexual tension is a hallmark of this genre.
*   **Rural Superstitions:** The mention of "Tenshin-san" (a local deity) and "Ko-umare kigan" (prayers for childbirth) reflects the deep-seated folk beliefs in rural Japan. The idea that a woman must be naked for a prayer to be effective is a common trope in such stories, often used to bridge the gap between "sacred" ritual and "profane" eroticism.
*   **Social Conventions:** The character Nobuo represents the "modern" man (an educator) struggling against the "backward" and "lecherous" traditions of the village. His concern for the "purity" of his students highlights the post-war emphasis on educational reform.
*   **The "Beast-man" Archetype:** Kumajī represents a recurring trope in Japanese rural fiction: the "primal" old man who operates outside of modern morality. His history of assaulting women during the war and in the village serves to establish the "dangerous" atmosphere of the rural setting.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **猟談 (Ryōdan):** Literally "hunting talk," but used here as a pun or parallel to **猥談 (Waidan)** (dirty talk).
*   **仇姿 (Adasugata):** An alluring, charming, or coquettish appearance.
*   **淫獣 (Injū):** "Lascivious beast" or "lecherous animal."
*   **フシグラ (Fushigura):** An archaic or regional term for superstition or "old wives' tales." Nobuo uses it dismissively.
*   **効験 (Kōken):** Efficacy or "virtue" of a religious act/prayer.
*   **且つく (Katsuku):** A regionalism or specific term used by the old man, likely meaning "to cling" or "to follow," referring to the husband's presence spoiling the ritual.
*   **ハツ口 (Hatsuku / Hatsuguchi):** Refers to the "body side" or armhole opening of a traditional garment (kimono/yukata).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Civilization vs. Primitivism:** Nobuo (the teacher) represents modern logic and morality, while the villagers and Kumajī represent a primitive, "beastly" nature.
*   **Voyeurism and the Gaze:** The text explicitly mentions that peeping is a "normal" activity in the village. The "licking gaze" of the old man is described as a physical sensation for the female protagonist.
*   **Fertility and Nature:** The story links human sexuality with the cycles of the farm (potatoes, wheat fields) and nature (the stars, the mudstone path).
*   **Eroticism under the Guise of Folklore:** The plot point regarding the "naked prayer" is a classic rhetorical strategy in post-war popular fiction to include erotic descriptions within a narrative about tradition and "village life."
