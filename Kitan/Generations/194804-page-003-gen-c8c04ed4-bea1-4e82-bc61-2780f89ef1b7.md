**加茂川清子**

新しい「奇譚クラブ」の讀者の皆様に、アタシを自己紹介致します。あたしの名前は樺島惠津子。通名は河原町の悦ちゃん。はつきり言うと叱られるから某としておきますが、某私立高等女學校の五年生。（テンブラぢやないわよ）嫌いなものは素えきらないニヤケた男と偽善者（例えば上品振つてる奥さん、職權を振廻す警官や役人、勝手な時だけ紳士になる男――そんな奴はみんな大嫌い！）怖い人は京都檢察廳の鴨川檢事さん、好きなものはダンス、お酒その他澤山あるわ。不良でデタラメでやんちやできかん氣な所は自信があるし、時と場合によつては淫賣や喧嘩位するわ、まア大体そういつた女ですので、あたしがいつもどんな事をしてるかつて、それは默つて次を讀めば分るわよ。

（一）
木屋町裏の糯つた喫茶店「ルージュ」へ、セーラー服で前髪の可愛い娘が一人入つて来た、彼女が悦子である。
隅で學生が二、三人神秘にコーヒを啜つてる外には、退屈そうな顔の女給が一人居るだけで、店の中はガランとしていた。
「あゝ疲れた、コーヒ頂戴。ウィスキー一寸入れてね。」
彼女は側のボックスへ毬のように身體を投出すと、ポケツトからラッキーストライクを取出した。ウィスキーコーヒを運んで来たらウェートレスに火を點けてもらつて、美味そうにフーッと吸込むと、クッションへ深々と身體を埋めるようにした。
「踊つてらしたの？」
「うん、ヘンな學生が誘つて来たから、美松のアベック・タイムを奢らしてやつたの」
香の強いコーヒを美味そうに啜つていると、今迄隅の方で何か話していた學生の一人が火を借りに来たついでに向側へ腰を下ろして、
「失禮ですけど、あの眼鏡掛けてる人御存じですか」
とギコチない態度で話しかけて来た。
「知つてるわ、美術學校の岡倉さんでしよ？」
「え、……えゝ、そうです、實はその、岡倉君に貴女の事を今少し聞いたのですが、僕の願いを聞いてくれませんか、いや、別にその……無理にとは言わないんですが……」
と始めて會つた娘に物を頼もうとする下手なスチュチュアが、彼女にはふと紳士的なものを喫かされたような気がした。そのしどろもどろの様子を見かねたのだろう。奥のボックスから岡倉と呼ばれた學生も出て来て、
「悦ちやん、たつた二時間程で夕飯を食わせて一千圓利得があるんだが、今夜でも出て来ないか？」
「話がうますぎるわね。あたしに高等淫賣でもしろと言うの？」
「まアそうムキになるない、話さねば分らない事だが、いつもの岡倉が話してるんぢやないといふ先入感を以て聞いてくれ給え、実はこの人は洋畫家の吉井暎嶺伯爵の息子さんなんだがね、この人の兄さんが文展に出品する少女裸像を書きたがつてるんだ。所が適當なモデルが居ないので困つてられるんだが、君なら身体もいいし、立派にポーズもつけられるだろうから。君を推薦しようと思うのさ。」
「モデルになればいいのね。」
やつと納得した悦子は、かなりその仕事に心を惹かれてるらしかった。
「そうさ、でも、若い娘は毎日裸になる事は本職のモデルでない限り嫌がるから、一日でいいといふんだ、つまりいろいろな角度からいろいろなポーズで寫眞を撮つておいて、後はその寫眞によつて画を描くんだね。だから二時間程辛抱して貰えば、夕飯も御馳走するし謝禮として千圓出すとゆうんだ。藝術の為だと思つて来てあげてくれないか。」
側から補佐うな吉井とゆう學生も頭を下げて頼むので、とうとう彼女も首を縦に大きく振つて、
「あたしでいいのなら面白そうだから行くわ。でも、モデルつて裸になるんでしよ？」
「うん、でも、アトリエは二重窓になつてるから暖かいよ。それとも裸になるのが羞しいのかい？全部脱ぐんだよ。黒いズロースも。」
岡倉は例の不良らしい口調になつた。
「知つてるわよ、そんな事ぐらい、男に裸を見られて羞しい位なら始めから断るわ、でもねえ、腋毛やなんか毛が生えてたままでもいいの？モデルつてみんな剃るんでしよ？」
「みんな剃らないわよ、刑法に觸れるから書家が勝手に書かないだけの事さ、悦ちやんでももう毛が生えてるのかい。」
「あたしだつて子供ぢやないわよ。」
「三年前から生えてるつてのかい？」
「嫌らしい人！それで一休時に何所へ行けばいいのよ。」

**Record of Lipstick Schoolgirl Behavior**
**Atelier Uproar**
**By Kiyoko Kamogawa**

To the new "Kitan Club" readers, I will introduce myself. My name is Etsuko Kabashima. My common name is Etsu-chan of Kawaramachi. Since I’ll get scolded if I say it clearly, I’ll keep it as "Certain," but I am a 5th-year student at a certain private high school for girls. (I’m not a "Tempura" student, you know.) Things I hate are indecisive, smirking men and hypocrites (for example, ladies acting refined, police and officials swinging their authority, men who act like gentlemen only when it's convenient—I hate all such people!). The person I fear is Prosecutor Kamogawa of the Kyoto District Public Prosecutors Office. Things I like are dancing, alcohol, and many others. Regarding being a delinquent, sloppy, naughty, and strong-willed, I have confidence. Depending on the time and occasion, I might even do prostitution or fighting. Well, since I am that kind of woman, as for what I am always doing, just shut up and read the following and you will understand.

(1)
Into the damp coffee shop "Rouge" in the back of Kiyamachi, a girl with cute bangs in a sailor uniform came in alone. She is Etsuko.
Except for two or three students in the corner mysteriously sipping coffee, there was only one waitress with a bored face; the inside of the shop was deserted.
"Ah, tired. Give me coffee. Put a little whiskey in it."
She threw her body like a ball into a side booth and took out a Lucky Strike from her pocket. When the whiskey coffee was brought, she had the waitress light it, blew out a puff with a tasty-looking "fuu," and buried her body deeply into the cushion.
"Were you dancing?"
"Yeah, some strange student invited me, so I made him treat me to Mimatsu's 'Avec Time'."
While sipping the strong-smelling coffee with relish, one of the students who had been talking in the corner until now came to borrow a light and sat down on the opposite side.
"Excuse me, but do you know that person wearing glasses?"
He spoke to her with an awkward attitude.
"I know him. He's Okakura-san from the Art School, right?"
"Eh... yes, that's right. Actually, about that, I heard a bit about you from Okakura-kun, but won't you listen to my request? No, specifically... I won't say I'm forcing you..."
The clumsy stature of trying to ask something of a girl he met for the first time made her feel as if she had sensed something gentlemanly. Perhaps unable to watch the fumbling state, the student called Okakura came out from the back booth and said,
"Etsu-chan, just for about two hours, I can get you dinner and a 1,000 yen profit. Won't you come out tonight?"
"That sounds too good to be true. Are you telling me to do some high-class prostitution?"
"Now, don't get so defensive. It's something you won't understand unless we talk, but please listen without the prejudice that the usual Okakura is speaking. Actually, this person is the son of the Western-style painter Count Yoshii Eirei. This person's older brother wants to paint a nude statue of a young girl to submit to the Bunten (Ministry of Education Art Exhibition). However, he is troubled because he can't find a suitable model. Since you have a good body and could probably strike a fine pose, I thought I'd recommend you."
"So I just need to be a model."
Etsuko, having finally understood, seemed quite attracted to the job.
"That's right. But young girls hate becoming naked every day unless they are professional models, so he says just one day is fine. In other words, he'll take photos from various angles in various poses, and after that, he'll paint the picture based on those photos. So, if you endure for about two hours, he'll treat you to dinner and give you 1,000 yen as a reward. Won't you come for the sake of art?"
Since the student named Yoshii also bowed his head and asked as if assisting from the side, she finally nodded her head deeply.
"If I'm okay, it sounds interesting, so I'll go. But being a model means becoming naked, right?"
"Yeah, but the atelier has double windows, so it's warm. Or is it embarrassing to be naked? You take everything off. Even the black drawers."
Okakura turned to his usual delinquent-like tone.
"I know that much. If I were embarrassed enough to care about a man seeing me naked, I'd refuse from the start. But hey, is it okay even with armpit hair or whatever still growing? Models all shave, don't they?"
"They don't all shave. It's just that painters don't paint it as they please because it touches on the criminal code. Does Etsu-chan have hair growing already?"
"I'm not a child either, you know."
"Are you saying it's been growing for three years?"
"You're disgusting! So, where should I go at the break time?"

**Chronicles of a Lipstick Schoolgirl**
**The Atelier Incident**
**By Kiyoko Kamogawa**

Allow me to introduce myself to the readers of the new *Kitan Club*. My name is Etsuko Kabashima, though on the streets of Kawaramachi, they call me Etsu-chan. I’d get in trouble if I named my school, so let’s just say I’m a fifth-year at a certain private girls' high school. (And no, I’m not just pretending to be a student!) 

The things I hate: wishy-washy, smirking men and hypocrites—the kind of women who act all refined, the cops and bureaucrats who hide behind their authority, and men who only play the gentleman when it suits them. I detest the whole lot of them! The only person who scares me is Prosecutor Kamogawa at the Kyoto District Office. The things I love: dancing, drinking, and a whole list of other things. I’m proud of being a delinquent—rough, reckless, and stubborn as a mule. Depending on the mood, I’ve been known to brawl or even walk the streets. That’s the kind of girl I am. If you want to know what I’ve been up to lately, just shut up and keep reading.

(1)
A girl with cute bangs and wearing a sailor uniform stepped into "Rouge," a damp little coffee shop tucked away in the back alleys of Kiyamachi. This was Etsuko. 
The place was deserted save for a few students in the corner huddled mysteriously over their coffees and a waitress who looked like she was dying of boredom. 
"God, I'm beat. Give me a coffee. And spike it with some whiskey."
Etsuko threw herself into a booth like a tossed ball and fished a Lucky Strike out of her pocket. When the whiskey-laced coffee arrived, she had the waitress light her cigarette, took a deep, satisfying drag, and sank into the cushions.
"Been dancing?" the waitress asked.
"Yeah. Some weird student asked me out, so I made him foot the bill for 'Avec Time' at the Mimatsu."
As she sipped her aromatic coffee, one of the students from the corner approached, ostensibly to borrow a light. He slid into the seat across from her.
"Excuse me, but... do you know that guy over there with the glasses?" he asked awkwardly.
"Sure do. That’s Okakura from the art school, right?"
"Uh... yes. Exactly. Actually, Okakura-kun was telling me about you... I have a favor to ask. I mean, it’s not... I'm not trying to force you or anything..."
His bumbling, nervous attempt to ask a favor of a girl he’d never met before actually struck Etsuko as somewhat gentlemanly. Seeing his friend falter, Okakura himself came over from the back booth.
"Etsu-chan, I can get you a thousand yen and a free dinner for just two hours of your time. You free tonight?"
"Sounds too good to be true," she replied. "What, are you asking me to be some high-class call girl?"
"Don't get your feathers ruffled. Listen to me—and try to forget it’s just me, Okakura, talking. This guy here is the son of Count Yoshii Eirei, the Western-style painter. His older brother wants to paint a nude of a young girl for the National Art Exhibition, but he can't find a decent model. I thought you’d be perfect—you’ve got the body for it and you know how to strike a pose. I want to recommend you."
"So, I just have to model?" 
Etsuko seemed genuinely interested.
"That's it. Professional models don't mind, but most girls hate being naked every day. He says just one day is enough. He'll take photos from every angle, and then paint the piece from the photos. Two hours of patience gets you a nice dinner and a thousand-yen fee. Come on, do it for the sake of art."
The other student, Yoshii, bowed his head in plea. Finally, Etsuko gave a firm nod.
"If I'll do, it sounds fun. I'm in. But modeling means being stark naked, right?"
"Yeah. But don't worry, the atelier has double-paned windows, so it’s warm. Or are you shy? You have to take off everything. Even those black bloomers." Okakura had slipped back into his usual delinquent drawl.
"I'm not stupid. If I were too shy to let a man see me naked, I wouldn't have agreed. But... what about armpit hair and stuff? Don't models have to shave all that off?"
"Not everyone. Painters just don't usually paint it because it might run afoul of the obscenity laws. Why, Etsu-chan, have you started growing hair already?"
"I'm not a child, you know."
"What, has it been growing for three years then?"
"You're disgusting! Fine, where do I need to go and when?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The text is presented in a traditional Japanese vertical layout (tategaki), read from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The title uses a large, bold, hand-drawn or stylized font common in 1940s-50s magazines. The main text uses a standard serif typeface typical of movable type printing of the era.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the most prominent element, followed by the author's name (加茂川清子) in a smaller but still distinctive hand-written style. The body text is divided into columns. 
*   **Illustration:** A small, simple line drawing of a woman's face (presumably the protagonist, Etsuko) is positioned in the top left, giving the piece a "shojo" or pulp fiction feel.
*   **Page Markers:** A small "— 8 —" at the bottom indicates the page number.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-war "Kasutori" Period):** This text likely comes from a "Kasutori" magazine (named after a cheap, dregs-based liquor). These magazines flourished between 1946 and 1950, focusing on "erotic-grotesque-nonsense" (ero-guro-nansensu) and providing cheap entertainment for a public struggling with post-war poverty.
*   **"Lipstick Schoolgirl" (Kuchibeni Jogakusei):** The term refers to schoolgirls who defied strict school rules by wearing makeup. In the post-war era, this was a symbol of rebellion, Westernization, and sometimes delinquency.
*   **"Tempura" Student:** A slang term for someone who looks like a student (wearing a uniform) but isn't actually enrolled or doesn't attend classes—"crispy on the outside (the uniform), but something else on the inside."
*   **Kiyamachi and Kawaramachi:** These are famous entertainment and nightlife districts in Kyoto. Setting the story here immediately establishes a "city girl" or "delinquent" vibe.
*   **Lucky Strikes:** Mentioning American cigarette brands was a common way to signal "coolness" or association with the Allied Occupation forces.
*   **The 1,000 Yen Fee:** In the late 1940s, 1,000 yen was a significant sum (roughly equivalent to a month's salary for a low-level clerk), explaining why Etsuko finds the offer "too good to be true."
*   **Obscenity Laws:** The mention of "criminal code" (刑法) regarding painting body hair refers to Japan's strict obscenity laws (Article 175), which often censored depictions of pubic hair in art and media until the 1990s.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **奇譚クラブ (Kitan Club):** A famous magazine known for publishing stories involving mystery, erotica, and the bizarre.
*   **アトリヱ (Atorie):** An older spelling of "Atelier" (art studio) using the obsolete kana 'we/ye' (ヱ).
*   **行状記 (Gyojoki):** A "record of behavior" or "chronicle of conduct," often used in titles for semi-biographical or cautionary tales.
*   **淫賣 (Inbai):** An older term for prostitution.
*   **美松 (Mimatsu):** Likely a reference to a real dance hall or cafe in Kyoto at the time.
*   **アベック (Abekku):** From the French *avec* (with). In post-war Japan, it meant a "couple" or "dating."
*   **文展 (Bunten):** The Ministry of Education Art Exhibition, a prestigious venue for artists.
*   **ズロース (Zuroosu):** From "drawers." A type of undergarment (bloomers).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Rebellion:** Etsuko represents the "New Woman" of the post-war era—independent, smoking, drinking, and cynical toward authority figures (police, "refined" ladies).
*   **Art vs. Morality:** The dialogue creates a tension between "Art" (the painting) and "Morality" (the act of being naked). The characters use the prestige of the "Count" and "Art Exhibition" to legitimize a request that borders on the sexual.
*   **Economic Survival:** The immediate focus on the 1,000 yen reflects the harsh economic reality of the time, where even schoolgirls were looking for ways to make money.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** While the men are "scouting" her, Etsuko is portrayed as being in control of the negotiation, using her sexuality and "tough girl" persona as leverage.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Kasutori Literature.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Delinquency, Post-war Japan, Kyoto, Art, Eroticism (Subtle), Modern Girl (Moga), Rebellion.
*   **Classification:** Pulp fiction.
