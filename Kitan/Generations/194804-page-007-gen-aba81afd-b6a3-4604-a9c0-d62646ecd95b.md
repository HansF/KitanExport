★ 南大阪の暗黒街展望
古里 弘

南大阪の玄関、天王寺、新世界、南霞町、飛田、萩之茶屋一帯にかけては、まことに變態と獵奇とを秘めた。隠然と夜の街に君臨する特殊地帯である。
東京の淺草、墨東一帯ほどの深刻なる、デカタン味はないにしても、男娼はゐるし、特殊喫茶は多いし、パンパンに至っては無盡蔵、木賃宿と数えあげれば、暗黒街としての相應の御膳が揃つているから、毎日毎夜獵奇を求めて徘徊しても中々興味は盡きないわけである。
幸か不幸かもつて生れた獵奇趣味からあれこれと探しあてた南大阪の珍名所を御紹介しよう。

一、變態男の珍技

處は飛田遊廓、東門石段を降りきつて石塀に沿つた××楼前の通路。時間は一定していないが、遊客の往来の比較的少い、陽の落ちきつた直後や、やま入りの一時間前というた時刻に、あたりの人氣を伺いながら登場する變態男がある。
着こし召した背廣なども、相当に立派でチヨビ髭を生やした四十輩の男や、三十四五才の着流しの男、着流しといっても、大島であるから捨てたものぢやない。
私の調査によると男は合計三人はいる。ところで此の變態男はあたりに人のないのを伺い、楼の格子の蔭にひそんで、おもむろに前の鈕をはずし、隠し持つたる松茸を取り出すそして遊女をかい間見ながら、ニタニタ笑つて我田引水に及ぶ。
彼氏の最も好むのは真赤な色で此れを見ると、無性に昂奮すると見えて、真赤な腰巻や襦袢をちらつとのぞかして貰えば、全く悦に入つてしまう。
ところが、彼氏らは、遊ぶ金がないから、やむなく變態行爲で滿足しているのだと、推察するのなら、それは大誤りである。彼等に言わせると、女との正常な應接よりも、此の方がどれだけ異常な昂奮と快感を得るかわからないのである。
三、四年前迄は山王町一丁目の飛田門通りの露地にある××喫茶店附近に出没していたが、戰時中に同店が閉鎖したために、河岸をかえ、最近は此處を足場にしているのである。
つて、變態性も相當期が入つている。
けれども彼らの變態行爲はおいそれと見られない、と言うのは女と見ると悦いつて、これ見よがしの露骨な振舞いをする彼らも、一たん男を見ると、コソコソと暗闇にかくれてしまうからである。
だから女装でするか、物蔭にでもかくれた時期を待つか、何れにしても並大抵のことでは見られないのである。

二、サデイズム女郎

元來、飛田にしろ松島にしろ大阪の遊廓はどう言うものか、通り一遍で、特殊サービス等は中々もつて行きあたらない。
そこへ行くと、流石は京都である祗園、宮川などは、色々の好みに應じた女がおつて、それにいとも親切である。おつと話が横道へそれたがそれは何れ後日のお楽しみとして、ところで最近飛田にサデイズムの女郎が、三、四人あらわれた事は全く頼もしい。
××楼のお染さん等はその典型である。彼女は以前、大門筋のカフェーにいたが、例の七ーストツプでさらりと身を沈めた、當年とつて芳紀まさに二十一才の美人である。
彼女のサデイズムと言うのは、相當なもので、少し感じが出てくると客をつかまえて抓ねたり、擦つたりは、まだよいとして、愈々高潮して感激つてくると、無暗矢鱈に噛みつき、果ては馬乗りとなつて首を締める。
殊にアルコールが廻つていると、文字通りの狂的な無茶苦茶の行爲に生傷の三つや四つを負うのは、まだまだ生やさしいもので、うつかりしていると大事なもの迄喰いちぎられてしまうかも知れない。
かと言つて、世の中はよくしたもので、此れで相應に客があるから全く不思議である。どうです一度試しに遊んで見ては、なに生命に別條はないでしょう。呆證はしませんが。

三、社交喫茶の秘密

大阪中に社交喫茶と名のつくものは誠に多いが、その中で最も面白いのは、なんと言つても飛田附近にくものはない。
それもグランドは駄目。ボツクスの五六脚も並べたチャチヤなのが面白い。遊びには夫々コツがあつて夜でも行こうものなら、腹を空かして手繻ねを引いて待つている女どもにワツとばかりにたかられ、その末が胴輩の手前柄、たいしたサービスもして呉れず、阿呆くさい事限りがない。
ゆっくりと手厚いサービスして貰う積りなら白晝行くことである。
部屋が薄暗くて、女は裏番が一人か二人しかいないから、たかられると言う心配がない。
欠伸ばかりして退屈しきつている矢先だから、此れ幸いと中々サービスがよい。もともと此處らの社交喫茶...

南大阪の玄関、天王寺、新世界、南霞町、飛田、萩之茶屋一帯にかけては、まことに変態と猟奇とを秘めた、隠然と夜の街に君臨する特殊地帯である。
東京の浅草、墨東一帯ほどの深刻なるデカダン味はないにしても、男娼はいるし、特殊喫茶は多いし、パンパン（街娼）に至っては無尽蔵。木賃宿（安宿）と数え上げれば、暗黒街としての相応の御膳が揃っているから、毎日毎夜猟奇を求めて徘徊しても、なかなか興味は尽きないわけである。
幸か不幸か持って生まれた猟奇趣味から、あれこれと探し当てた南大阪の珍名所を紹介しよう。

一、変態男の珍技

場所は飛田遊廓。東門の石段を降りきって石塀に沿った××楼前の通路。時間は一定していないが、遊客の往来が比較的少ない、日が落ちきった直後や、「山入り」の一時間前という時刻に、あたりの人気を伺いながら登場する変態男がある。
着こなした背広なども相当に立派で、ちょび髭を生やした40代輩の男や、35、6歳の着流しの男。着流しといっても大島紬（高級絹織物）であるから、捨てたものではない。
私の調査によると、男は合計3人はいる。ところで、この変態男はあたりに人のないのを伺い、楼の格子の陰に潜んで、おもむろに前のボタンを外し、隠し持った「松茸（隠語）」を取り出す。そして遊女を垣間見ながら、ニタニタ笑って「我田引水（自慰行為）」に及ぶ。
彼が最も好むのは真っ赤な色で、これを見ると無性に興奮すると見えて、真っ赤な腰巻きや襦袢をちらりと覗かせてもらえば、全く悦に入ってしまう。
ところが、「彼らは遊ぶ金がないから、やむなく変態行為で満足しているのだ」と推察するのなら、それは大誤りである。彼らに言わせると、女との正常な応接よりも、こちらの方がどれだけ異常な興奮と快感を得るかわからないのである。
3、4年前までは山王町一丁目の飛田門通りの路地にある××喫茶店付近に出没していたが、戦時中に同店が閉鎖したために河岸を変え、最近はこちらを足場にしているのである。
つまり、変態性も相当年季が入っている。
けれども、彼らの変態行為は、おいそれとは見られない。というのは、女を見ると喜んでこれ見よがしの露骨な振る舞いをする彼らも、一旦男を見るとコソコソと暗闇に隠れてしまうからである。
だから女装でするか、物陰にでも隠れて時機を待つか、いずれにしても並大抵のことでは見られないのである。

二、サディズム女郎

元来、飛田にしろ松島にしろ、大阪の遊廓はどういうものか、通り一遍で、特殊サービスなどはなかなか行き当たらない。
そこへ行くと、流石は京都である。祇園、宮川などは、いろいろな好みに応じた女がいて、それにいとも親切である。おっと、話が横道へ逸れたが、それはまた後日のお楽しみとして。ところで最近、飛田にサディズムの女郎が3、4人現れたことは、全く頼もしい。
××楼のお染さんなどはその典型である。彼女は以前、大門筋のカフェーにいたが、例の「七ーストストップ（強制閉鎖？）」でさらりと身を沈めた（娼婦になった）、当年とって芳紀まさに21歳の美人である。
彼女のサディズムというのは相当なもので、少し感じが出てくると、客を捕まえてつねったり、擦ったりするのはまだ良いとして、いよいよ高潮して感激してくると、むやみやたらに噛みつき、果ては馬乗りとなって首を絞める。
特にアルコールが回っていると、文字通りの狂的なめちゃくちゃの行為に、生傷の3つや4つを負うのはまだまだ生易しいもので、うっかりしていると大事なもの（急所）まで食いちぎられてしまうかもしれない。
かと言って、世の中はうまくできているもので、これで相応に客がいるから全く不思議である。どうです、一度試しに遊んでみては。なに、生命に別状はないでしょう。保証はしませんが。

三、社交喫茶の秘密

大阪中に「社交喫茶」と名のつくものは誠に多いが、その中で最も面白いのは、なんと言っても飛田付近にしくものはない。
それもグランド（大規模店）はダメ。ボックス（席）を5、6脚も並べたちゃちなのが面白い。遊びにはそれぞれコツがあって、夜でも行こうものなら、腹を空かせて手ぐすね引いて待っている女どもにワッとばかりにたかられ、その末が胴震いの手前、大したサービスもしてくれず、阿呆くさいこと限りがない。
ゆっくりと手厚いサービスをしてもらうつもりなら、白昼行くことである。

★ South Osaka's Underworld Prospectus
By Furusato Hiroshi

Regarding the gateway of South Osaka—Tennoji, Shinsekai, Minami-Kasumicho, Tobita, and the Haginochaya area—it truly hides abnormality (hentai) and the bizarre (ryoki). It is a special zone that imperceptibly reigns over the night streets.
Even if it lacks the deep decadent flavor of Tokyo's Asakusa or Bokuto areas, male prostitutes exist, special cafes are many, and as for "pan-pan" (streetwalkers), they are inexhaustible. If one counts the "kitchinyado" (cheap lodgings), appropriate preparations as an underworld are assembled; therefore, even if one wanders every day and night seeking the bizarre, interest does not easily run out.
Whether by good or bad fortune, from a born taste for the bizarre, I will introduce the "strange famous places" of South Osaka that I have searched out here and there.

1. The Strange Skill of the Perverted Man

The place is the Tobita licensed quarters. Having descended the stone steps of the East Gate, the passage in front of XX Brothel along the stone wall. The time is not fixed, but at times when the traffic of guests is relatively low—just after the sun has completely set, or about one hour before the "entry to the mountain" (opening time)—gauging the presence of people around, a perverted man appears.
His dressed suit is quite respectable, a man of the 40-something cohort with a "chobi" mustache, or a man of 34 or 35 years in "kinagashi" (casual kimono). Even if called kinagashi, it is Oshima (high-quality silk), so it is not something to be dismissed.
According to my investigation, there are three men in total. By the way, this perverted man, gauging that no one is around, hides in the shadow of the brothel's lattice, slowly unfastens his front button, and takes out the "matsutake" (mushroom/penis) he was hiding. Then, while glimpsing the courtesans, he smiles "nita-nita" (grinningly) and reaches "Gaden-insui" (drawing water to one's own field / masturbation).
What he likes most is the color bright red; seeing this, he apparently becomes intensely excited, and if he is shown a glimpse of a bright red waistcloth or undergarment, he falls into total ecstasy.
However, if one surmises that "these guys, because they have no money to play, are forced to be satisfied with perverted acts," that is a great mistake. According to them, compared to normal dealings with women, they do not know how much more abnormal excitement and pleasure they obtain from this.
Until three or four years ago, he appeared near a certain XX Cafe in the alley of Tobita-mon Street in Sanno-cho 1-chome, but because that shop closed during the war, he changed his "riverbank" (location) and recently uses this place as a base.
Thus, his perverted nature has considerable years of experience.
However, their perverted acts cannot be seen easily. That is to say, though they act boldly for show when they see a woman, once they see a man, they "koso-koso" (secretly) hide in the darkness.
Therefore, whether one does it by cross-dressing or waiting for a time hidden in the shadows, either way, it cannot be seen by ordinary means.

2. The Sadism Prostitute

Originally, whether in Tobita or Matsushima, Osaka's brothels—whatever they may be called—are "street-level" (standard), and "special services" are not easily encountered.
When one goes there, as expected of Kyoto—Gion, Miyagawa, and so on—there are women who respond to various tastes, and they are extremely kind. Oops, the talk has strayed into a side path, but let that be a pleasure for a later date. By the way, recently, that three or four sadistic prostitutes have appeared in Tobita is truly encouraging.
"O-some-san" of XX Brothel is a typical example. She was previously at a cafe in Daimon-dori, but with the "Seven-stop" (likely a police crackdown/closure), she lightly "submerged her body" (entered the trade); she is a beauty of exactly 21 years of age.
Her "sadism" is quite something; when a bit of feeling comes out, catching the guest and pinching or rubbing is still okay, but as it finally reaches a climax and she becomes moved, she bites recklessly, and in the end, sits astride the guest and strangles his neck.
Especially when alcohol is circulating, in literally mad and reckless behavior, bearing three or four raw wounds is still easy; if one is careless, even the "important thing" (genitals) might be bitten off.
That said, the world is well-made, and because she has a corresponding number of guests, it is truly mysterious. How about it—trying to play once? Well, there will likely be no threat to your life. I won't guarantee it, though.

3. Secrets of Social Cafes

In all of Osaka, those called "Social Cafes" are truly many, but among them, the most interesting is, no matter what is said, none can beat those near Tobita.
Even then, "Grand" (large) ones are no good. "Chatchi" (cheap/small) ones with five or six boxes (booths) lined up are interesting. In playing, there are respective "knacks," and if one goes at night, one is swarmed by women waiting with "hand-suturing" (waiting eagerly/greedily) with empty stomachs; in the end, before the "shaking of the torso" (fear/regret), they don't give much service, and it is limited in its stupidity.
If you intend to receive slow and hospitable service, go in broad daylight.
The room is dim, and because there are only one or two "ura-ban" (back-shift girls), there is no worry of being swarmed.
Since it is the very moment they are bored and yawning, they think "this is lucky" and the service is quite good. Originally, the social cafes around here... [Text cuts off]

★ **A Glimpse into the South Osaka Underworld**
*By Hiroshi Furusato*

From the gateway of South Osaka at Tennoji and Shinsekai, through Minami-Kasumicho and Tobita, down to the Haginochaya area, there exists a hidden realm of deviance and the macabre. It is a "special zone" that holds a quiet, dark sovereignty over the city's night-shrouded streets. While it might lack the profound, heavy decadence of Tokyo’s Asakusa or Bokuto districts, it is by no means lacking in flavor. With its male prostitutes, "special" cafes, an inexhaustible supply of *pan-pan* girls, and a glut of flophouses, the underworld's table is fully set. For one who wanders these streets night after night in search of the bizarre, the fascination never truly fades. Whether it be a blessing or a curse, my innate curiosity for the strange has led me to discover several of South Osaka’s "curious landmarks," which I shall now introduce.

**1. The Pervert’s Singular Skill**

The setting is the Tobita red-light district. Just past the stone steps of the East Gate, along the stone wall in front of a certain brothel. The timing varies, but usually just after dusk when the crowds thin, or about an hour before the brothels officially open for the night, a particular deviant makes his appearance. He watches the surrounding foot traffic warily. Despite his habits, he is quite respectably dressed—sometimes a man in his forties with a neat "chobi" mustache wearing a fine suit, or perhaps a mid-thirties man in a casual kimono made of high-quality Oshima silk.

My investigation reveals there are at least three such men. This fellow waits for a gap in the crowd, lurks in the shadows of a brothel’s wooden lattice, and slowly unfastens his trousers to reveal his "matsutake mushroom." While peering at the courtesans within, he grins lecherously and indulges in a bit of "self-service." He has a particular fetish for the color bright red; the mere sight of it seems to send him into a frenzy. If a girl happens to flash a glimpse of a red waistcloth or chemise, he is transported to a state of total bliss.

One might assume these men are merely too poor to pay for a woman and are thus forced into such acts, but that would be a grave error. According to them, a normal encounter with a woman cannot compare to the intense, abnormal euphoria they derive from this display. These men are veterans; until a few years ago, they haunted the alleys near a certain cafe in Sanno-cho, but after that shop closed during the war, they moved their "fishing grounds" here. However, catching them in the act is no easy feat. While they are bold enough to expose themselves to women, the moment they spot a man, they scurry away into the shadows. Unless you are cross-dressing or hiding in the dark, you are unlikely to witness their "performance."

**2. The Sadistic Courtesan**

By nature, the brothels of Osaka—whether in Tobita or Matsushima—tend to be rather perfunctory. One rarely encounters "specialized" services. In that regard, Kyoto remains superior; in districts like Gion or Miyagawacho, one finds women who cater to every specific taste with great kindness. But I digress—I shall save those stories for another time. Recently, however, three or four sadistic courtesans have appeared in Tobita, which is a heartening development for the scene.

A girl named O-some at a certain brothel is the prime example. Formerly a waitress at a cafe in Daimon-dori before a police crackdown forced the shop to close, she is a 21-year-old beauty who has since "sunken" into the trade. Her brand of sadism is quite formidable. When she begins to feel "in the mood," she starts by pinching and scratching the guest—which is manageable—but as her excitement peaks, she loses all restraint, biting wildly and eventually mounting the guest to wring his neck.

If she’s had a few drinks, her behavior becomes truly manic. Escaping with only three or four open wounds is considered a light sentence; if you aren’t careful, she might just bite off your "most precious asset." And yet, the world is a strange place—she has no shortage of regular customers. Why not give it a try yourself? It’s unlikely to kill you, though I make no promises.

**3. The Secrets of the "Social Cafes"**

Osaka is crawling with so-called "Social Cafes," but the most intriguing ones are undoubtedly found near Tobita. Avoid the large, flashy "Grand" establishments. The real interest lies in the cramped, tawdry shops with only five or six booths. There’s a trick to enjoying them: if you go at night, you’ll be swarmed by greedy girls waiting to pounce on your wallet, and you’ll likely end up paying a fortune for very little service.

If you want dedicated, attentive service, the trick is to go in the middle of the day. The rooms are dim, and since there are only one or two girls on shift, you won’t be mobbed. Because they are bored to tears and doing nothing but yawning, they welcome the company and provide excellent service. Originally, the social cafes in this area... [End of page]

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The text is set in traditional vertical columns (read right to left). The title is enclosed in a decorative box with stars, a common feature in mid-century Japanese periodicals to denote a feature story or "special report."
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the largest element, followed by the author's name. Section headers (一, 二, 三) are clearly marked, providing a structured "tour" of the underworld.
*   **Censorship/Style:** The use of "××" to mask the names of specific brothels or cafes is a stylistic choice common in *kasutori* (pulp) magazines. It serves two purposes: protecting the publication from legal trouble or "morality" police, and adding an air of "insider mystery" for the reader.
*   **Tone:** The writing is a mix of journalistic observation and "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) sensationalism. It uses a conversational, slightly mocking, yet enticing tone (e.g., "I won't guarantee [your life]").
*   **Page Number:** The number "7" at the bottom indicates this is an early page in the magazine, likely a lead feature.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII / 1940s-50s):** The mention of "war-time closures" and the term "pan-pan" (the slang for streetwalkers catering to Allied occupation forces) places this firmly in the late 1940s to early 1950s. This was the era of the *Kasutori* magazine—cheap, sensationalist publications printed on bad paper that focused on the "3 Ss": Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports.
*   **Geography:**
    *   **Tobita Shinchi:** One of Japan's largest and most famous red-light districts. Even today, it maintains a unique legal status by operating as "restaurants" (*ryotei*).
    *   **Shinsekai/Tennoji:** Historically the "rougher" part of Osaka, known for its entertainment, day laborers, and nightlife.
*   **Social Categories:**
    *   **Pan-pan:** Street prostitutes who became a visible social phenomenon during the Occupation.
    *   **Special Cafes (Tokushu Kissa):** Often a front for prostitution or "illegal" sexual services, different from a standard coffee shop.
    *   **Decadence (Dekatan):** A popular loanword used to describe the nihilistic, pleasure-seeking atmosphere of the post-war ruins.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **變態 (Hentai):** In this era, it meant "abnormality" or "sexual perversion" in a clinical or descriptive sense, rather than the modern Western association with anime.
*   **獵奇 (Ryoki):** Seeking the bizarre, grotesque, or macabre. A key keyword of the "Ero-Guro-Ryoki" movement.
*   **我田引水 (Gaden-insui):** Literally "drawing water to one's own field" (a proverb about selfishness). Here, it is used as a punning euphemism for masturbation.
*   **松茸 (Matsutake):** "Mushroom." A common Japanese euphemism for the penis.
*   **芳紀 (Hoki):** A literary term for the "flower of youth," specifically referring to a young woman's age (usually around 20).
*   **七ーストツプ (Seven-stop?):** This likely refers to a specific police ordinance or a "crackdown" era (perhaps related to the "Seven" o'clock closing times or a specific regulation number) that forced cafes to close or change their business model.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Urban "Other":** The text treats South Osaka as a frontier or a different world. It frames the "underworld" as something to be explored by a "gentleman" explorer for the sake of curiosity.
*   **The Economy of Pleasure:** There is a recurring theme of money—the perverts who allegedly have no money but actually just prefer their "hobby," and the "greedy" women at the cafes who swarm customers.
*   **Gender and Power:** The section on "Sadism" flips the traditional power dynamic of the brothel. The author presents the violent courtesan as a "encouraging" or "reliable" (頼もしい) novelty, showing a subculture interested in masochistic play.
*   **Post-War Nihilism:** The tone suggests a world where traditional morals have collapsed, replaced by a desperate, often violent search for sensation in the ruins of the city.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay, Reportage, Pulp Fiction/Non-fiction.
*   **Primary Tags:** Underworld, Erotica, Osaka, History, Red-light District, Fetishism, Post-war Japan.
