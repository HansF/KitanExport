友達一人とてもなく、常に寒々しい孤愁の中に沈んでいた。
彼は自分の夢を破り、青春を打ち砕いた二人の女性、新子と美代子を心から恨んでいた。その一人が、偶然今日彼を訪ねて来たので、懐旧の赴くままに新子のアパートへも行き、二人に悲しい回想を懐述したのだった。
「貴方が一楽荘へいらした時、新子さんはどうしてました？」
「何だか頭が痛いとかいって、蚊帳を吊って裸で寝てましたが、僕達が行くとすぐ起きて来ましたよ」
「お帰りは美代子さんとご一緒でしたか？」
「出口までは一緒でした。それから美代子はお茶を誘ったが、僕は断って、堤の道を家へ帰りました。その途中、貴方の家の前でしばらく将棋を指してましたが」
そうだ、あの一楽荘出火の時は、彼は確かに晴子たちの目前にいた。しかも新子は出火の時はまだ確かに生きていた。とすると、彼は不動のアリバイを持っている。しかもあの出火の時の奇怪な表情も、よく頷ける。動機には最も危険に見える彼は、実際は最も無難な人間なのだ。
とにかく放火は八時少し前に行われた。それより以後ではあり得ず、それより以前なら、起きていた新子に発見されただろうし、もっと早く火災が起こったことになる。発火時間だけは動かないとすると、鶴橋は新子を焚殺（ふんさつ）するために、八時前にあそこへ放火することは、絶対になし得ない。

だが、美代子には不利だった。彼女なら、一旦アパートの前で鶴橋に別れ、それから裏へ回って非常階段を登り、裏階段を登った所にある新子の部屋へ侵入することもできるし、火を放つこともできる。たとえドアに鍵が掛かっていても、流し元の小窓を開いて、引火しやすい蚊帳に火を投げれば、十分に火災は起こり得るからである。しかしその彼女には、全く新子殺害の動機がないのだ。部長が朝から渋面になって、晴子の知恵を求めようとしたのも、そのためである。
再度状況が検討されたが、やはり鶴橋の無罪は動かず、彼は間もなく釈放された。

大学の解剖報告書によると、新子が身体に火を受けたのは、生前だったか死後だったかという点については、次のように書かれていた。これは隣室の大学生・森吉君夫の、新子の悲鳴が、錯覚か幻聴でなかったかということを確かめ、焼死を装って、他の方法で殺した死体の、犯跡をくらませようと企んだ放火ではなかったかということを、立証するものだった。
まず、死体は喉頭、会厭（ええん）に多量の煤をつけており、そこに高度の充血、腫脹、水疱形成、粘膜剥離などが認められた。これは、熱気の吸引によって惹起されたもので、時にそのために声門水腫を起こし、窒息死の原因ともなる。煤はさらに深く気管支内に認められ、粘液と混じって黒色物ともなっていた。これらは、咽頭から食道の方へ飲み込まれたもので、こんなに深部までは、死後には侵入することがないから、彼女は生前の火傷死と断定された。
またその第二の重要な所見は、心臓内血液や、大血管内の血液に、一酸化炭素が証明されたことである。死斑も内臓も、一酸化炭素血液の鮮紅色を呈するが、もし他の方法で殺された死体が、一酸化炭素含有度の高い部屋に置かれた場合には、その死体の死斑、その他皮膚上層血管内の血液は、外部からの一酸化炭素の侵入によって、鮮紅色を呈してくるけれども、深部の血液にまでこの影響が及ぶことがないからである。その一酸化炭素は、小さな分光鏡などでは、20％以下の含有量では不明瞭なので、特にクンケル（Kunkel）氏法（化学検査）によって証明された。
法医学は、彼女は確かに火傷直前まで生きていたことを立証し、頭痛の原因は、腸管内から多数発見された、回虫によるものだろうと解された。また胃壁…

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Friend even one not at all, always in chilly lonely sorrow was sinking.
He his own dreams broke, youth shattered two women, Shinko and Miyoko, from heart hated. That one person, by chance today him visited came because, as nostalgia led Shinko's apartment also went, to two people sad recollections recounted.
"When you to Ichirakuso came, Shinko-san how was doing?"
"Somewhat head hurts or something saying, mosquito net hanging naked was sleeping but, we go when immediately woke up came."
"Return with Miyoko-san together was?"
"Until exit together was. After that Miyoko tea invited but, I refused, embankment road home returned. That midway, your house in front for a while Shogi was playing but..."
That's right, that Ichirakuso fire time, he certainly Haruko-others' eyes-front was. Moreover Shinko fire time yet certainly alive was. If so, he immovable alibi has. Moreover that fire time's strange expression also, well can understand. In motive most dangerous seems he, in reality most safe human is.
Anyway arson 8 o'clock slightly before performed was. Than that after not possible, than that before if, awake was Shinko by discovered would have been, more early fire would have happened. Ignition time only if not moving, Tsuruhashi Shinko burn-to-death for, 8 o'clock before there arson to do, absolutely cannot do.

But, for Miyoko disadvantageous was. She if, once apartment in front Tsuruhashi part, then back around emergency ladder climb, back stairs climbed place located Shinko's room, intrude thing also can, fire set thing also can. Even if door key hung, sink-source small window open, easy-to-ignite mosquito net fire throw if, sufficiently fire occur can because is. But that her, at all Shinko murder motive not have. Chief from morning sour-faced become, Haruko's wisdom seek-to-try thing also, that for is.
Again situation examined was but, after all Tsuruhashi's innocence not move, he soon released was.

University autopsy report according to, Shinko body fire received, alive was or dead after was about point, following way written was. This next door university student Moriyoshi Kimio's, Shinko's scream, illusion or hallucination not was thing confirm, fire-death feign, other method by killed corpse, crime traces hide-to try planned, arson not was thing, prove thing was.
First, corpse larynx, epiglottis in large amount soot attached has, there high-degree congestion, swelling, blister formation, mucous membrane peeling etc recognized were. This, hot air inhalation by induced thing, sometimes that for glottis edema cause, suffocation death cause also becomes. Soot furthermore deeply bronchi inside recognized, mucus mixed black substance also had become. These, pharynx from esophagus direction toward swallowed things, such deep parts until, after death intrusion thing not because, she alive-time burn death concluded was.
Also that second important finding, heart-inside blood and, large vessels-inside blood in, carbon monoxide proven thing is. Post-mortem lividity also internal organs also, carbon monoxide blood's bright red color exhibit but, if other method by killed corpse, carbon monoxide content high room placed case in, that corpse's lividity, other skin upper layer vessels inside blood, from outside carbon monoxide intrusion by, bright red color exhibit come although, deep part blood until this influence reach thing not because is. That carbon monoxide, small spectroscope etc by, 20% below content in unclear because, especially Kunkel-method (chemical test) by proven was.
Legal medicine, she certainly burn-just-before until alive was thing proven, headache cause, intestinal tract inside from many discovered, roundworms by thing probably understood was. Also stomach wall...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Having not a single friend, he was constantly submerged in a chilling, lonely sorrow. He harbored a deep-seated hatred for the two women who had shattered his dreams and crushed his youth: Shinko and Miyoko. Since one of them happened to visit him today, he followed the pull of nostalgia and went to Shinko’s apartment as well, where he recounted sad memories to the two of them.

"When you arrived at Ichirakuso, how was Shinko-san?"
"She mentioned having a headache or something and was sleeping naked under a mosquito net, but she got up as soon as we arrived."
"Were you with Miyoko-san on the way back?"
"We were together as far as the exit. Then Miyoko invited me for tea, but I refused and took the embankment road home. On the way, I stopped to play Shogi in front of your house for a while..."

That’s right—at the time the fire broke out at Ichirakuso, he was certainly right in front of Haruko and the others. Moreover, Shinko was definitely still alive when the fire started. This meant he had an ironclad alibi. Even his strange expression during the fire now made sense. Though he seemed the most dangerous in terms of motive, in reality, he was the safest suspect.
In any case, the arson took place shortly before eight o'clock. It couldn't have been later than that; and had it been earlier, the then-awake Shinko would have discovered it, causing the fire to break out sooner. If the time of ignition is fixed, it would have been absolutely impossible for Tsuruhashi to set the fire before eight to burn Shinko to death.

However, things looked bad for Miyoko. She could have parted with Tsuruhashi in front of the apartment, circled to the back, climbed the fire escape, and entered Shinko’s room via the back stairs. Even if the door were locked, she could have opened the small window by the sink and tossed a flame onto the highly flammable mosquito net, which would easily start a fire. Yet, she had absolutely no motive to murder Shinko. This was exactly why the Chief had been sour-faced since morning and was seeking Haruko’s insight.
The circumstances were reviewed once more, but Tsuruhashi’s innocence remained unshaken, and he was soon released.

According to the university’s autopsy report, the following was written regarding whether Shinko had been caught in the fire while alive or after death. This evidence was meant to prove whether the arson was an attempt to cover up a murder committed by other means by feigning a death by fire, and to confirm whether the scream heard by the neighbor, a student named Kimio Moriyoshi, was a reality or a hallucination.
First, the corpse had a large amount of soot in the larynx and epiglottis, where severe congestion, swelling, blister formation, and mucosal peeling were observed. These were caused by the inhalation of hot air, which can sometimes cause glottic edema and lead to death by suffocation. Soot was found even deeper within the bronchi, mixed with mucus to form a black substance. Because these substances are swallowed from the pharynx toward the esophagus and cannot reach such depths after death, her death was determined to be a result of being burned while still alive.
The second critical finding was the presence of carbon monoxide in the blood within the heart and major vessels. While both post-mortem lividity and internal organs take on the bright red hue of carbon-monoxide-saturated blood, if a body killed by other means is placed in a room with high carbon monoxide levels, this bright red color will only appear in the lividity and the blood of the upper skin vessels due to external penetration; it will not reach the blood in the deeper parts of the body. Since the carbon monoxide levels were below 20%—making them difficult to detect with a small spectroscope—they were specifically proven using the Kunkel method.
Forensic science thus proved that she was certainly alive right until the moment of the burns. It was also concluded that her headaches were likely caused by the numerous roundworms discovered in her intestinal tract. Furthermore, the stomach wall...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a traditional Japanese vertical (top-to-bottom, right-to-left) format. It is divided into columns, but the flow is interrupted by a central illustration.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-20th-century printing. Some kanji forms are older (*kyūjitai* or variations like 歸, 聲, 澁, 樂), but most are recognizable to modern readers.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text uses indentation for dialogue and paragraphs. The page number "(99)" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Illustration:** A line-drawing illustration occupies the center-right. It depicts a man (likely Tsuruhashi or a witness) peering through a window or doorway. Below him is a handwritten-style formula: "3 - 1 = 2". This likely refers to a "deduction puzzle" or the number of suspects/victims. The style is reminiscent of 1950s detective fiction (known as *honkaku* or *henka* mystery).
*   **Structure:** The first half of the text focuses on narrative dialogue and the establishing of alibis. The second half (starting on the left) shifts into a technical, pseudo-scientific tone, describing an autopsy in detail.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1960s):** The orthography (mixing some older kanji with modern kana) and the specific medical terminology suggest a post-WWII era, likely the 1950s. This was a "Golden Age" for detective magazines in Japan (like *Hōseki*).
*   **Forensic Science in Fiction:** The detailed description of carbon monoxide levels and "Kunkel's method" reflects the "scientific detective" trope popular in that era. Authors like Seicho Matsumoto or those influenced by Edogawa Ranpo often incorporated realistic (or realistic-sounding) forensic details to ground their mysteries.
*   **Social Conventions:** The mention of "mosquito nets" (蚊帳 - *kaya*) indicates a time before widespread air conditioning and modern insect screens, a common fixture in Japanese summers of that period.
*   **Roundworms (蛔虫 - *kaichū*):** The mention of roundworms as a cause for a headache might seem strange to modern readers, but in the mid-20th century, parasitic infections were still relatively common in Japan, and their presence in medical/forensic context was a standard detail.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **一楽荘 (Ichirakuso):** A typical name for an apartment building or boarding house (*sō*).
*   **懐述 (Kaijutsu):** To recount or relate memories. A somewhat literary term.
*   **焚殺 (Funsatsu):** To kill by burning. A specific, somewhat archaic term for "burning to death" as a criminal act.
*   **澁面 (Shibuzura/Shibumen):** A "sour face" or a grimace.
*   **会厭 (E-en):** Epiglottis. A technical medical term.
*   **鮮紅色 (Senkōshoku):** Bright red/scarlet color. Specifically used in forensics to describe carbon monoxide poisoning.
*   **死斑 (Shihan):** Post-mortem lividity (livor mortis).
*   **Kunkel氏法 (Kunkel-shi hō):** Kunkel's test. A historical chemical test used to detect carbon monoxide in the blood.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Ironclad Alibi":** A classic mystery theme. The protagonist/detective must deconstruct an alibi that seems physically impossible to break.
*   **Science vs. Appearance:** The narrative contrasts the "dangerous-looking" suspect (Tsuruhashi) with the "innocent-looking" but potentially physically capable suspect (Miyoko). However, medical science (the autopsy) provides the objective truth that overrides visual impressions.
*   **The Macabre:** The detailed description of "mucosal peeling" and "blister formation" reflects the darker, "erotic grotesque nonsense" (*ero-guro-nansensu*) roots of Japanese mystery fiction, though here it is presented as clinical fact.
*   **Logic and Deduction:** The "3-1=2" formula suggests a logical elimination process. If there were three people and one is removed (by alibi or death), the remaining two become the focus of the puzzle.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Detective Mystery)
*   **Genre:** Honkaku Mystery, Forensic Thriller
*   **Themes:** Arson, Alibi, Autopsy, Forensic Science, 1950s Japan
*   **Tone:** Analytical, Suspenseful, Clinical
