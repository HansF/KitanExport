**今はむかし**

**宣愁院　春高**

**〔第一話〕**
**若夫婦桃色のゆめ**

今は昔。京の宮家に仕える男が、年貢米を徴集するため上野の國へ下つた。永らく旅をした擧句歸途、美濃の不破の關に宿をとつた。
彼には京に、まだ新婚間のない若い妻があつたが、旅に出る前頃より、どうも、その素振りに不思議なことがあつたので、彼はふとその事を思ひ出した。
すると急に新妻のことが、堪らなく懐かしくなつてきた。
「今頃はどうしているだろうか？」
彼は胸が切なく疼くまでに彼女のことを想つた。そして夜が明けたなら、荷物をおいて大急ぎで歸らうと心にきめた。そして宿の一部屋にそのまま寝入つてしまった。
暫らく、まどろむと、向うから灯を携えた一人の青年が女をつれてやつてきた。やがて、彼の寝ている部屋の傍へ来たのを見ると、その女というのは、彼が京へ置いてきた氣のものめる新妻ではないか。
彼はあツと驚いた。どうした事だろう。不思議なことだ。憎らしい想像が彼を捕えた。
二人は彼の隣りの部屋に泊つた。壁一重である。彼は壁の穴から隣りの部屋を覗いた。見ると青年と新妻とは、寄り添つて並んで、鍋をとり寄せると、直ぐ飯の用意をして一緒に食べ始めた。
彼の心は波のように騒いだ。そうだ、俺が旅に出ている間に、この若僧奴と夫婦の語らいをしたに相違ない。――彼はこう考えて尚も覗いていると、やがて食事の終つた二人は一つ床に臥せたが、間もなく夫の彼にとつては、見るに堪えないことが、壁一重へだてた彼方に始められた。
激怒した彼は、物も言わずに躍り込んでみると、火もな、男も女二人の姿も見えない。――これは一場の夢であつた。
「あゝ夢であつてよかったなア」
と彼はホッとしたが、次の瞬間、烈しい不安が彼をさいなんだ。彼は夜の明けるのを待ちかねて、先を急いだ、夜になつても宿もとらずに、歩きに歩いて、その足で家へ飛び込んでみると、新妻は何の変わりもなく、にこやかに彼を迎えた。
「妾は、昨夜變な夢を見ました。妾の所へ見たこともない男が一人やつてきて、何処とも知らぬ所へ妾をつれて行つたのです。夜でした。灯をもしてある空屋へ入つて、飯を炊いて男と二人で食べた後、二人で寝た所へ突然あなたが現れたかつたので、男も妾も騒ぎ出したと思うと眼がさめました。不思議なこともあるものだと、思つていましたらこうして、あなたがお戻りになりました」
「ほいお」
彼は思わず頭をひねつた。
「実は俺も、そのような夢を見て、夜を日に繼いで帰つて来たのだ」
二人は、不思議なことがあるものだなアと感心した。

**〔第二話〕**
**好色破戒僧の死**

今は昔。多くの犬を飼つておき、それを連れて山野に、鹿や猪などを咬みとらせて家業としている者があつた。世の人には、こうした者を犬山と呼んでいた。
或る日、いつものように犬をつれて山へ分け入つた。食物を携えて暫く山で暮すときもあつたが、その時も、やはり二三日は戻らなかつた。
家には、まだ年若い妻が一人留守番をしていた。
その時、一人の坊さんが軒に立つて、おごそかに食物を乞うた。見ると、水もしたたるばかりの端麗な美僧である。
妻は安心して、坊さんを家の中へ招いて、物を與えた、すると坊さんは、厳然として「私は決して乞食ではありません、佛の道を修業しながら諸國をさまよい歩いている者です、丁度食がなくなつたので、御無心したまでとのこと。」
ときびしく言つた。これを聞いて若い妻は愈々その坊さんを信じて尊敬した。やがて坊さんは又言つた。
「私はその外に、陰陽の方も知つています、霊験あらたかな祭事をも行つています」「祭事と申しますと、それをすれば、どんな事になるのでございますか」
「そうです、僧侶が精進し、且つ賢なる者であれば、身に病なく、自ら財産が出来、神の祟りを受けるような事なく夫婦の仲むつまじく、萬事がよい方に向くようになるものです。」

「私は、昨夜変な夢を見ました。私の所へ見たこともない男が一人やってきて、どこ共知らぬ所へ私を連れて行ったのです。夜でした。灯をともしてある空き家へ入って、飯を炊いて男と二人で食べた後、二人で寝た所へ突然あなたが現れたかと思ったら、男も私も騒ぎ出したところで目が覚めました。不思議なこともあるものだと思っていましたら、こうしてあなたがお戻りになりました」

**Ima wa Mukashi (Now is Old/Long Ago)**
**Collection of This Country's Color Tales**
**Senshuin Harutaka**

**[Chapter 1]**
**The Young Couple's Pink Dream**

Now is long ago. A man serving an Imperial household in Kyoto went down to the country of Ueno to collect land-tax rice. After a long journey, on the way back, he took lodging at the Fuwa Barrier in Mino.
In Kyoto, he had a young wife he had only recently married, but since before he left for the journey, somehow, in her mannerisms there were strange things, so he suddenly remembered that matter.
Then, suddenly, the matter of the new wife became unbearably nostalgic.
"How is she doing at this time?"
He thought of her until his chest painfully throbbed. And when the night broke, leaving his luggage, he decided in his heart to return in a great hurry. And in one room of the inn, he fell asleep just like that.
When he slumbered for a while, from the other side, one youth carrying a light came bringing a woman. Before long, seeing them come to the side of the room where he was sleeping, that woman—was it not the anxious new wife he had left in Kyoto?
He said "Ah!" and was surprised. What could it be? It is a strange thing. A hateful imagination captured him.
The two stayed in the room next to his. It was a single wall thickness. Through a hole in the wall, he peeped into the next room. Looking, the youth and the new wife, snuggling and lining up, when they drew a pot near, they immediately prepared a meal and started eating together.
His heart surged like waves. "That's it, while I am out on a journey, with this young monk-fellow, they must have had couple-talk." —While he thought this and still peeped, before long the two who finished the meal lay in one bed, but soon for the husband him, things unbearable to see were started on the other side separated by a single wall.
He, who was enraged, without saying a word, when he leapt in, there was no fire, and neither the figures of the man nor the woman could be seen. —This was a scene of a dream.
"Ah, it was good that it was a dream," he felt relieved, but the next moment, a fierce anxiety tormented him. He could not wait for the night to break and hurried ahead; even when it became night, without taking an inn, walking and walking, when he jumped into the house with those feet, the new wife without any change, smilingly welcomed him.
"I saw a strange dream last night. To my place, a man I had never seen before came alone, and to a place I did not know, he took me. It was night. Entering an empty house where a light was lit, after cooking rice and eating with the man, just as I thought you suddenly appeared where we two were sleeping, the man and I started a commotion and I woke up. While I was thinking that strange things happen, like this, you have returned."
"Ho-oh."
He involuntarily tilted his head.
"Actually I too, seeing such a dream, returned night and day."
The two were impressed that there are strange things.

**[Chapter 2]**
**The Death of the Lewd Apostate Monk**

Now is long ago. There was a person who kept many dogs, and taking them to the mountains and fields, made it his family business to have them bite and take deer and boars. To the people of the world, such a person was called an Inuyama (Dog-mountain).
One day, as usual, taking the dogs, he entered deep into the mountain. Carrying food, there were times he lived in the mountain for a while, and at that time too, as expected, for two or three days he did not return.
In the house, one still-young wife was house-sitting alone.
At that time, one monk stood at the eaves and solemnly begged for food. Looking, he is an elegant, beautiful monk, as if water were about to drip.
The wife was relieved, invited the monk into the house, and gave things. Then the monk, sternly: "I am by no means a beggar. I am a person wandering through various provinces while practicing the Way of the Buddha. Just because food ran out, I merely asked for a favor."
Thus he said strictly. Hearing this, the young wife more and more trusted and respected that monk. Before long the monk said again:
"Besides that, I also know the way of Onmyo (Yin-Yang). I also perform rituals with miraculous efficacy."
"If you say rituals, if one does that, what kind of things will happen?"
"That is so. If a monk devours himself to purity and is a wise person, there will be no illness in the body, wealth will naturally come, without receiving a curse from the gods, the couple's relationship will be harmonious, and all things will come to head in a good direction."

**Tales of Old**
**An Anthology of Amorous Tales from Our Realm**
**by Senshuin Harutaka**

**[Chapter One]**
**The Young Couple’s Rose-Colored Dream**

Long ago, there lived a man in the service of an Imperial household in Kyoto. He traveled to the province of Kozuke to collect the annual land tax in rice. On his long journey back, he took lodging at the famous Fuwa Barrier in the province of Mino.
He had a young wife in Kyoto whom he had only recently wed. Yet, even before his departure, there had been something unsettling about her demeanor, and the memory of it suddenly flickered in his mind.
A sudden, overwhelming wave of nostalgia for his bride washed over him.
"I wonder how she fares at this very moment?"
He yearned for her until his heart physically ached. He resolved that as soon as dawn broke, he would leave his heavy luggage behind and race home. With this thought, he drifted into a deep sleep in his room at the inn.
After some time in a fitful slumber, he saw a young man carrying a lantern approaching with a woman in tow. As they drew near his sleeping quarters, he was shocked to realize the woman was none other than the bride he had left behind in Kyoto—the very source of his recent anxiety.
He gasped in astonishment. How could this be? What strange turn of fate was this? Dark, hateful suspicions took hold of his mind.
The pair took the room adjacent to his, separated only by a thin wooden partition. Peering through a small knot-hole in the wall, he watched as the young man and his wife sat close together. They pulled a cooking pot toward them, prepared a meal, and began to eat.
His heart churned like a stormy sea. *I knew it!* he thought. *While I have been away, she has been trysting with this young whelp.* He continued to watch, his anger mounting. When the meal was finished, the two lay down together in a single bed. Before long, a sight unbearable for any husband to witness began just on the other side of that thin wall.
Enraged, he leapt into the next room without a word—only to find neither fire, nor man, nor woman. It had all been a vivid dream.
"Thank heavens... it was only a dream," he sighed, relieved. But a moment later, a piercing dread seized him. Unable to wait for the morning light, he hurried on his way. He pushed through the night without rest, walking until his feet were sore, and burst through his front door. There he found his young wife, looking exactly as she always did, greeting him with a radiant smile.
"I had such a peculiar dream last night," she said. "A man I’ve never seen before came to me and spirited me away to a place I didn't recognize. It was dark. We entered a vacant house where a lamp was burning, cooked some rice, and ate together. Just as we lay down to sleep, you suddenly appeared. The man and I were thrown into such a panic that I woke up. I was just marveling at what a strange omen it was when you suddenly arrived home."
"Is that so?" the husband replied, tilting his head in bewilderment.
"To tell the truth, I had the exact same dream. It was that dream that drove me to travel day and night to reach you."
The two sat together, struck by the uncanny mystery of their shared vision.

**[Chapter Two]**
**The Death of the Lustful Apostate**

Long ago, there was a man who made his living by keeping a large pack of hounds, which he took into the mountains to hunt deer and wild boar. People called men of his profession "Inuyama"—the Mountain Dog Men.
One day, he headed into the mountains with his dogs as usual. Sometimes his hunts required him to camp out for several days, and on this occasion, he did not return for two or three nights.
His young wife remained at home alone to mind the house.
During his absence, a monk appeared at her doorstep, solemnly begging for alms. He was an exceptionally handsome man, his beauty described as "so fresh it was as if water were about to drip from him."
Feeling at ease, the wife invited him inside and offered him food. The monk, however, maintained a stern and dignified air. "I am no mere beggar," he said sharply. "I am a seeker of the Way, traveling the provinces in my spiritual training. I have only asked this of you because my supplies have run low."
Impressive and austere, his words won the young wife’s trust and respect. After a time, the monk spoke again.
"Furthermore, I am well-versed in the arts of Yin and Yang. I perform sacred rituals that yield miraculous results."
"Rituals?" she asked. "What sort of blessings do they bring?"
"Indeed," he replied. "If the monk is devoted and wise, these rites ensure a body free of illness, the natural accumulation of wealth, and protection from divine curses. They foster harmony between husband and wife and turn all fortunes toward the light."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese vertical (tategaki) layout, reading from right to left. It uses a three-column structure per page, which was common in mid-20th-century popular magazines (*zasshi*) or "B-class" literature collections.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Ming-style (Minchō) typeface typical of post-war printing. It uses *furigana* (reading aids) sparingly, only for difficult or specific kanji (though none are particularly prominent in this specific crop). The use of brackets like 〔第一話〕 serves as clear section headers.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The main title "本朝いろものがたり集" is centered and significantly larger, enclosed in a decorative border that mimics traditional woodblock book covers. The author's name is placed below it in a smaller box.
*   **Illustrations:** The top right features a stylized illustration of a woman’s face in a "bijin-ga" (beautiful woman) style, which bridges the gap between traditional ukiyo-e aesthetics and modern manga/gekiga styles of the 1950s.
*   **Orthography:** The text uses a mix of modern and slightly older kanji forms (e.g., 國 for 国, 擧 for 挙, 歸 for 帰). It uses the small "tsu" (っ) for geminate consonants, suggesting it was printed after the 1946 orthographic reforms, yet it retains a "literary" feel by choosing some archaic kanji.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **"Ima wa Mukashi" (今は昔):** This is the classic opening phrase of the *Konjaku Monogatari Shū* (Tales of Times Now Past), a massive 12th-century collection of Buddhist and secular folk tales. By using this opening, the author is signaling that these stories are modern "pastiches" or reimaginings of classical Japanese folklore.
*   **Iromono-gatari (色物語):** The word "Iro" (color) in this context refers to "sensuality," "eroticism," or "affairs of the heart." This type of literature, known as *setsuwa* or *shōsetsu*, often focused on the human follies of lust and deception.
*   **Fuwa no Seki (不破の関):** A historically significant "barrier" or checkpoint in Mino Province (modern-day Gifu). In classical literature, it is a poetic site often associated with travel, separation, and the boundary between the capital (Kyoto) and the "east."
*   **Onmyō (陰陽):** Refers to Onmyōdō (the Way of Yin and Yang), a traditional Japanese esoteric cosmology. Practitioners (Onmyōji) were believed to be able to influence fate, perform exorcisms, and tell the future.
*   **Inuyama (犬山):** While "Inuyama" is a place name in Aichi, here it refers to a professional hunter who uses dogs. The text frames it as a specific, somewhat rough social class of the period.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **桃色のゆめ (Momoiro no Yume):** Literally "pink-colored dream." In Japanese, "pink" has long been the color associated with eroticism or romantic scandal (similar to "blue" in English "blue movies").
*   **若僧奴 (Wakasō-me):** A derogatory term for a young monk. The suffix "-me" (written here with the kanji 奴) adds a layer of contempt or anger.
*   **御無心 (Gomushin):** A polite way of saying "asking for a favor" or "begging for money/food," often used by monks or travelers.
*   **破戒僧 (Hakai-sō):** An "apostate monk" or a "corrupt monk"—specifically one who has broken the Buddhist precepts (such as the ban on sex or eating meat).
*   **端麗 (Tanrei):** Used to describe someone who is exceptionally beautiful or elegant.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Synchronicity and Dreams:** The first story explores the concept of *yume-ura* (dream divination) or spiritual connection between lovers. The fact that both husband and wife shared the same dream suggests a supernatural bond, though the husband's initial reaction is one of jealousy and suspicion.
*   **Anti-Clerical Satire:** The second story introduces the trope of the "lustful monk." In Japanese folklore, monks are frequently depicted as hypocrites who use their spiritual authority to seduce women. The title "Death of the Lewd Apostate" promises a moralistic (and likely gruesome or ironic) ending where the monk is punished for his deception.
*   **Male Anxiety:** A recurring subtext is the anxiety of the traveling husband. During the feudal periods (Edo and earlier), men often traveled for months, leaving wives at home. This led to a rich genre of "infidelity" stories driven by male insecurity.
*   **Modernizing Tradition:** The writing style is "neo-classical." It intentionally mimics the rhythm of ancient tales to provide a sense of escapism and "naughty" nostalgia for the Shōwa-era reader.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Folk Tale Pastiche.
*   **Genre:** Amorous Tales (*Iromono*), Erotica (soft), Supernatural/Folkore.
*   **Themes:** Infidelity, Dreams, Religion, Jealousy, Hunting, Ancient Japan.
*   **Target Audience:** Likely adult males in the 1950s looking for "entertainment" stories (*goraku shōsetsu*).
