ば弱い程、後味（あとあじ）が悪く妙に良心をちくちく刺されるような燥（いらだ）ちに狂暴になるのが癖だつた。それに、あきは確かに先天的に喧嘩がうまかつた。一度重ねる毎にいろいろと考えた。あきにはそれが最大の楽しみであつたし、熱心でもあつた。
　そんなあきは忽ち学校中の評判になつた。下級生はあきの傍を通る時は、丁寧なお辞儀をすると、こそこそと逃げるように立去つたし、上級生はわざと目を外して通つた。
　があきはそれが又気にくわなかつた。皆が自分を恐れているのではないか。女の範囲から除け者にして軽蔑しているに違いない、と歯をくいしばつていらいいらした。
　無論あきとて一沫の女への郷愁があつたからである。
　こんなあきであつたが、男と喧嘩をすることは全然なかつた。それは子供の頃から度々父親に折檻された記憶が男の暴力というものに対して先入意識として及ばないことを知つていたし、何一つはせめて男にだけは普通の女として見て貰いたい気持が動いていたからである。あきは男の前では普通の女と何等変る所がなかつた。
　が男と手を組んで街を歩く女を見るとつい腹が立つた。男の手をふりほどいて、女の顔を二つ三つ殴つたらどんなにせいせいすることだろうといつも思つた。
　或る日、学校がひけて帰り途、公園の下の道を一人で歩いていると、前を学生らしい男と、これ又セーラーの服装をした女学生とが連れだつているのに出遭つた。スマートな服装で、髪をのばした背の高い男であつたが手にはバンドに縛つた教科書らしいものをぶら下げていた。一方の女学生は編んだ髪を雨方に分けた品の良いタイプで腰がいらやしい感じであつた。
　公園の古い城跡の下からガードの下をくぐつて公園の入口まであきは黙つてついて行つた。女学生は時々甲高い声を上げて笑つた、屈託のない笑い声であつた。手を上げて男をぶるような恰好もした。男は笑い乍ら逃げる真似をしてみたりして楽しそうな二人連れだつた。黙つてついて歩いていたあきは次第にいらいらし始めた。追い越して通り過ぎようとしたが、横を下水の流れている道は狭く、二人並んだゞけでせいいつ杯の幅しかなかつた。
　あきは仕方なくそんな二人を眺めている中に、許し難い行為だと癇が立つて来たのだ。勿論嫉妬もあつた。その中には全く男の学生には見向きもされない私立の女学校の生徒である卑下がないもの女学生に対する憎悪を倍加していた。
　心の中では同じ女学生であり乍ら猥らな風紀を平然として醸し出しているこの娘に忠告を考えなければならないと一応正義漢めいた言い訳も持つていた。
　やがて公園の入口を通つて車庫の裏へ差掛ると、男は軽く手をあげて、お別れの挨拶らしく、女とは別の横の道へ外れて行つた。その女学生は名残を惜しむように、男の姿が街角を折れて見えなくなる迄其処に佇んでいたが、後からぽんと背を叩かれると驚いて振返り、あきの顔を不思議そうな眼差しで見た。
「あんた何処の女学生なの？」
　女学生はあきの聲に何かを感じて一瞬顔色を変えたが、やがて同じ女学生らしいのに安心したのか、
「そんなことあなたに問われるわけがないわ」
　幾分甲高い調子でさえあつた。
「そう、ちよいとこちらへおいでなさい」
　あきは落着いていた。女学生は流石顔色を再び変えたが、勝気らしくそれでも黙つてあきの後からついて来た。車庫の裏は広い原つぱであつた。土筆（つくし）やたんぽぽがちらほら咲き始めて、もう陽も落ちそうな夕暮の光に淋しい影を造つていた。その中を分けて原つぱの材木を積んである陰まで来ると、あきはたち止つた。
「あんた、女学生のくせに輩の中から男とふざけて恥しくないの？」
　あきの言葉に女学生ははつとした屈辱の表情を見せた。少し蒼ざめた顔に血の気がのぼり、面長い上品な顔立ちは春の夕陽に映えて美しかつた。あきはそれを見ると益々この女学生に対して憤懣を感じた。腕力でしか勝つことの出来ない感じがあき自身を忘れさせた。あきは女学生に近づくと、物も言わずに膝頭でスカートの上から下腹部をしたゝか蹴り上げた。「あつ」その女学生は持つていた通学鞄を思わず落して下腹部を押えて其処へくずれるようにしやがみ込んだ。低い呻き声が歯の間から洩れた。あきはその綺麗な襟元を上から見降し乍ら、
「謝つたらどう？」
と顔をゆがめて笑つた。その笑いはこんな時に必ず浮ぶ笑いであり、一種の優越と、然もその優越が充分満たされない焦燥と、罪を重ねたような自嘲の錯綜した複雑な笑いであつた。女学生はしばらくすると、かみ込んだ下唇を
「女の癖にどうしてそんな乱暴するのよ」
と切れんゞな口調で言つた。あきはその声から暴力しか持たない自分の急所を嘲笑されたように再びいきり立つた。
「何だつて、まだ反抗する気なの」
　あきはその女学生の襟を掴むと、ず〜と引き起し、前と同じ所を再び膝頭でつき上げた。今度は耐え切れず女学生は二三間後ろへよろめいて仰向けに引っくり返つた。スカートがめくれて白い太腿が見えると、あきは汚いものを見たかのように唾をはいた。女学生は顔をゆがめて、それでもすぐ上体を起すと、スカートを手で引き下し「わつ」と泣き伏した。
　両方に分けた髪が草の上に落ちて、しやくり上げる度に草がゆれた。あきは黙つてそれを見ていたが、女学生が泣き出すといよいよ冷い表情になつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The weaker [they were], the worse the aftertaste was, and strangely, as if her conscience were being pricked, she had a habit of becoming violent in an irritation. Besides that, Aki was certainly naturally good at fighting. Each time she repeated it, she thought about various things. For Aki, that was the greatest pleasure, and she was enthusiastic about it too.
Such an Aki immediately became the talk of the whole school. When underclassmen passed by Aki's side, they would give a polite bow and leave as if scurrying away, and upperclassmen would purposely avert their eyes as they passed.
But Aki disliked that again. "Isn't everyone afraid of me? They must be excluding me from the category of 'woman' and looking down on me," she thought, grinding her teeth in irritation.
Naturally, this was because even Aki felt a shred of nostalgia for being a "woman."
Despite being such an Aki, she never fought with men at all. That was because she knew from her childhood memories of being frequently punished by her father that she could not compete with male violence as a preconceived notion, and more than anything, a feeling moved her to want to be seen as a normal woman at least by men. Before men, Aki was no different from a normal woman.
But when she saw a woman walking through town with her arm linked with a man, she unintentionally got angry. "If I shook off the man's hand and punched the woman's face two or three times, how refreshed I would feel," she always thought.
One day, on the way home after school finished, while walking alone on a path below the park, she encountered a student-like man and a female student dressed in a sailor uniform walking together. He was a tall man in smart clothes with long hair, but in his hand, he dangled what looked like textbooks tied with a band. On the other hand, the female student was a refined type with her braided hair parted on both sides, and her waist gave off a vulgar impression.
From below the old castle ruins in the park, passing under the railway bridge, Aki followed silently to the park entrance. The female student occasionally laughed in a high-pitched voice; it was a carefree laughter. She even made a motion as if to swat the man. The man, while laughing, made a show of running away; they were a happy-looking pair. Aki, who was walking and following silently, gradually began to get irritated. She tried to overtake them and pass by, but the path with a sewer flowing beside it was narrow, and the width was at its limit with just two people standing side-by-side.
While Aki was forced to watch those two, a feeling of "unforgivable behavior" rose in her temper. Of course, there was jealousy too. Among that, the self-deprecation of being a student at a private girls' school that wasn't even looked at by male students doubled her hatred toward the [other] female student.
In her heart, she held a self-righteous excuse: "Even though she is a fellow female student, I must give advice to this girl who is calmly giving off an air of immoral public morals."
Soon, after passing the park entrance and approaching the back of a garage, the man lightly raised his hand, seemingly an or-parting greeting, and branched off into a different side path from the woman. That female student, as if reluctant to part, stood there until the man's figure turned the corner and could no longer be seen, but when her back was suddenly thumped from behind, she turned around in surprise and looked at Aki's face with a wondering gaze.
"What school are you a student of?"
The female student felt something in Aki's voice and her complexion changed for a moment, but eventually, perhaps relieved that it seemed to be a fellow female student,
"There is no reason for you to be asking such a thing," she said. It was even in a somewhat high-pitched tone.
"I see, come over here for a moment."
Aki was calm. The female student's complexion changed again as expected, but being strong-willed, she followed behind Aki silently anyway. The back of the garage was a wide field. Horsetails and dandelions were starting to bloom here and there, creating lonely shadows in the twilight light as the sun was about to set. Pushing through them to the shade of stacked lumber in the field, Aki stopped.
"You, despite being a female student, aren't you ashamed to be flirting with a man in broad daylight?"
At Aki's words, the female student showed an expression of sudden humiliation. Blood rushed to her slightly pale face, and her long, elegant features looked beautiful reflected in the spring evening sun. When Aki saw that, she felt even more resentment toward this female student. The feeling of being able to win only through physical force made Aki forget herself. As Aki approached the female student, without saying a word, she kicked her hard in the lower abdomen over her skirt with her knee. "Ah!" That female student unintentionally dropped the school bag she was holding, clutched her lower abdomen, and crumpled down there as if collapsing. A low groan leaked from between her teeth. Aki, looking down at her beautiful collar from above,
"How about apologizing?"
She laughed with a distorted face. That laugh was the kind that always appeared at such times—a complex mix of a kind of superiority, yet the irritation of that superiority not being fully satisfied, and self-mockery as if piling up sins. After a while, the female student, with her bitten lower lip,
"Even though you're a woman, why do you do such violent things?"
She said in a broken tone. From that voice, Aki felt as if her own weak point—having nothing but violence—was being mocked, and she became enraged again.
"What, you still intend to resist?"
Aki grabbed the female student's collar, pulled her all the way up, and thrusted her knee into the same spot as before. This time, unable to bear it, the female student staggered two or three *ken* (approx. 4-5 meters) back and flipped over onto her back. When her skirt turned up and her white thighs were visible, Aki spat as if she had seen something dirty. The female student distorted her face, but immediately raised her upper body, pulled down her skirt with her hands, and cried out "Waah!" face down.
Her hair, parted on both sides, fell on the grass, and every time she sobbed, the grass shook. Aki watched that silently, but as the female student began to cry, her expression became colder and colder.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The more pathetic her victims, the worse the aftertaste—yet Aki was driven by a compulsive habit, a prickling of the conscience that manifested as a sudden, violent irritation. She was, quite simply, a natural-born fighter. After every bout, she would reflect on the mechanics of the conflict; for her, violence was a craft to be practiced with both passion and meticulous care.

At school, her reputation had preceded her. Underclassmen would offer a stiff, formal bow and scurry away the moment she neared, while upperclassmen made a pointed effort to look anywhere but at her. 

This treatment grated on her. *They’re all terrified of me,* she thought, her teeth clenched in frustration. *They’ve decided I’m not a "girl" anymore. They’re looking down on me.* Beneath her rough exterior lay a lingering, faint nostalgia for the femininity she had been cast out from.

Despite her reputation, Aki never raised a hand against men. The childhood memories of her father’s harsh discipline had left her with an ingrained sense that she could never hope to match male strength. More than that, she harbored a desperate, unspoken desire: if no one else, she wanted men, at least, to view her as a normal woman. And indeed, in the presence of men, she was indistinguishable from any other girl.

But seeing a girl walking through town arm-in-arm with a man filled her with a white-hot rage. *If I could just tear her away and smash that face once or twice,* she would think, *imagine how clean I would feel.*

One afternoon, on her way home from school, Aki was walking alone through the park when she came upon a couple: a student-like young man and a girl in a sailor uniform. The man was tall and smartly dressed, carrying textbooks bound in a strap. The girl was the refined sort, her hair in neat braids, though to Aki’s eyes, the curve of her waist looked nothing but vulgar.

Aki followed them silently, trailing them past the old castle ruins and under the railway bridge. The girl’s laughter was high and carefree, and she playfully batted at the man as he teased her. Watching their easy intimacy, Aki’s irritation began to boil. The narrow path, hemmed in by a drainage ditch, left her no room to pass, forcing her to endure the sight of them.

Her annoyance curdled into a sense of moral outrage, though it was fueled by a deep-seated jealousy—the bitterness of a girl from a lowly private school whom no boy would ever look at. *I have to do something about this,* she told herself, cloaking her malice in a shroud of self-righteousness. *She’s a disgrace to female students everywhere.*

When they reached the back of a garage near the park entrance, the man gave a casual wave and turned down a side street. The girl lingered there, watching him until he disappeared around the corner. Aki stepped forward and tapped her sharply on the shoulder. The girl spun around, her eyes wide with confusion.

"What school are you from?" Aki demanded.

The girl’s face flickered with a brief flash of apprehension, but seeing only another student, she regained her composure. "I don't see why I should have to tell you that," she replied, her voice slightly shrill.

"Is that so? Come with me for a minute," Aki said, her voice eerily calm.

The girl’s color drained again, but her pride wouldn't let her back down, and she followed Aki into the overgrown field behind the garage. Dandelions and horsetails were beginning to sprout, casting long, lonely shadows in the fading spring twilight. Aki stopped behind a stack of lumber.

"Aren't you ashamed?" Aki spat. "A 'student' like you, flirting with a man in the middle of the day?"

The girl recoiled as if struck. A flush of humiliation rose to her pale cheeks; she was beautiful in the dying light, her features elegant and refined. The sight only fanned the flames of Aki’s resentment. The realization that her only power lay in her fists took hold of her. Without another word, Aki drove her knee hard into the girl’s lower abdomen.

The girl let out a sharp "Ah!" and dropped her bag, collapsing into a heap as she clutched herself. A low moan escaped her lips. Aki looked down at the girl’s pristine collar and sneered.

"Well? Aren't you going to apologize?" 

Aki’s face twisted into a smile—that familiar, complicated expression that always surfaced in these moments: a dark cocktail of superiority, the nagging itch of a triumph that felt hollow, and the self-loathing of a sinner.

The girl bit her lip, trembling. "You're a girl too... how can you be so cruel?" she managed to gasp.

The words struck Aki like a blow. It felt as if her one great weakness—the fact that she had nothing but her violence—was being mocked. Her temper flared again.

"What? You still want to fight back?"

Aki seized the girl by the collar, hauled her up, and drove her knee into the exact same spot. This time, the girl flew back several feet, landing hard on her back. Her skirt flipped up, exposing her white thighs; Aki spat on the ground as if she had seen something foul. The girl grimaced, but she immediately scrambled to pull her skirt down and buried her face in the grass, sobbing.

Her braided hair lay scattered in the dirt. With every sob, the blades of grass trembled. Aki watched her in silence, her expression growing colder with every tear the girl shed.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** This is a classic example of Japanese literary layout. The text is printed in **vertical orientation** (*tategaki*), reading from top to bottom and right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. It uses **furigana** (reading aids) for some kanji, such as "後味" (atoaji), "燥ち" (iradachi), and "土筆" (tsukushi).
*   **Column Structure:** The page is divided into two horizontal tiers (columns), though the text flows continuously from the top tier to the bottom tier on the same page.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "(21)" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is part of a larger serialized work or a short story collection.
*   **Era Indicators:** The use of "あつた" (atsuta) instead of "あった" (atta) and "つて" (tsute) in smaller script (but often full-sized in older prints) indicates the transitional period of Japanese orthography (late 1940s to early 1950s), though it leans towards modern usage.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Fiction:** The narrative style and themes (delinquency, psychological distress, social alienation) are highly characteristic of post-WWII Japanese literature. Authors like Yukio Mishima, Osamu Dazai, or Shintaro Ishihara often explored the darker impulses of youth during this era.
*   **Student Uniforms:** The "sailor suit" (*seifuku*) for girls and "smart" student attire for boys were symbols of status and youth. The protagonist's resentment toward a "private school student" (*shiritsu no jogakkō*) reflects the class consciousness and social hierarchy of the time.
*   **Social Morality:** The mention of "public morals" (*fūki*) and the shock of a girl "flirting with a man in broad daylight" reflects the conservative social expectations of the 1940s/50s, where such behavior was often labeled "decadent" (*botoku*).
*   **Gender Roles:** Aki’s internal monologue highlights the conflict between her violent nature (associated with masculinity) and her desire to be perceived as a "normal woman." Her violence toward other women is a projection of her own gender-based insecurities.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **燥ち (Iradachi):** Usually written as 苛立ち. It means irritation or fretfulness.
*   **折檻 (Sekkan):** Chastisement or physical punishment, often by a parent. It implies a harsh, corrective violence.
*   **卑下 (Hige):** Self-deprecation or humility, but here used to describe a sense of inferiority regarding her social standing.
*   **癪に障る (Shaku ni sawaru):** An idiom meaning to get on one's nerves or to be aggravating.
*   **二三間 (Ni-san ken):** A "ken" is a traditional unit of measurement (approx. 1.82 meters). "Two or three ken" would be about 4 to 5.5 meters.
*   **わっ (Wa-):** An onomatopoeia for a sudden burst of crying or a loud sob.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Misogyny and Internalized Sexism:** Aki targets other women because they represent the "femininity" she feels she has lost or can never attain. Her violence is a defense mechanism against being "excluded from the category of woman."
*   **Power Dynamics:** The story explores the "pleasure" of violence and the "superiority" felt over the weak. However, this power is portrayed as hollow and leading to "self-mockery" (*jichō*).
*   **Class Resentment:** There is a clear divide between the "refined" private school girl and Aki, who seems to come from a more troubled or lower-class background (implied by the father's violence and her school's reputation).
*   **The "Pure" vs. the "Impur":** Aki views the other girl’s flirting as "immoral," yet she views her own violence as "filthy" when she sees the girl’s exposed thigh. There is a deep psychological confusion regarding what is truly "dirty."
