## Literal English Translation

[The author] takes up the title of the mother-son incest articles that have recently been sensationalized in print, and records that there is a feeling that mother-son incest is completely in vogue.
Furthermore, Mr. Kakinuma writes that the phenomenon of mother-son incest popularization has a strange charm, but certainly, to defile or violate something sacred, or something desired to be sacred, is attractive.
Female teachers, nuns, high school girls, etc., have been the recurring objects of violation until now.
And now, with the mother—who ought to be absolutely sacred to the child—having been defiled, does the sacred no longer exist? Or rather, perhaps the sacred never existed in the first place? If we peek inside the things we believed to be sacred, they might all have been just human beings.
Nevertheless, for the transgressor's side, it is better if the object is sacred. Because reducing the sacred to equal oneself, or even lower, must be the ultimate ecstasy.
In Greek mythology, there is the story of Oedipus, who, unknowingly, married his real mother, and later, upon learning the truth, gouged out his own eyes. Compared to this story, the illustration showing a mother and son embracing (having sex) and then perhaps sitting around a dining table, or a brother and sister sitting around a dining table, is far more terrifying.
In "The Mother and Child in the Secret Room," the modern Oedipus is determined to be frail and weak, but is that truly the case? [He] casually makes his mother masturbate and ejaculates into her mouth. This would certainly shock even the Greek Oedipus.
Five years ago, the Italian master Pasolini, who was brutally murdered by a youth who was said to be his lover, used *Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom* as his final message, and also filmed *Apollo's Hell* based on Oedipus. At that time, he stated, "This is not about nearby problems, but what I myself have lived through," openly admitting that he had been in an incestuous relationship with his mother.
Perhaps one day, a law prohibiting mother-son incest may be enacted in our country. Conversely, a time may also come when other nations look to Japan and decide to lift their prohibitions. This is something unknown to this writer, who is neither a lawyer nor a researcher.

## Literary English Translation

[The essayist] notes that merely taking the titles of the mother-son incest articles currently sensationalized in magazines gives the impression that a mother-son incest trend is sweeping the nation.
Furthermore, Mr. Kakinuma argues that there is a mysterious allure to this trend, but undeniably, the act of defiling and violating something sacred—or something we wish to be sacred—is inherently attractive. Female teachers, nuns, and high school girls have long been the subjects of this repeated violation.
And now, with the mother—who should be absolutely sacrosanct to the child—having been defiled, one must ask: Does the sacred even exist anymore? Or perhaps, the sacred never existed historically? If one were to peer inside those things we believed to be holy, they would likely turn out to be nothing more than ordinary human beings.
Nonetheless, for the transgressor, it is preferable if the object *is* sacred. The height of ecstasy lies in reducing the divine to one's own level, or even lower.
In the Greek myth, Oedipus, unaware of her true identity, married his birth mother, only to later learn the truth and gouge out his own eyes. Compared to that tale, the image of a mother and son embracing (having sex) and then casually sharing a dining table, or perhaps a brother and sister sharing a dining table, is far more horrifying.
In the work "The Mother and Child in the Secret Room," the modern Oedipus is characterized as utterly spineless and weak, but is this truly accurate? [The modern Oedipus] casually makes his mother masturbate and then ejaculates inside her mouth. Even the original Greek Oedipus would surely be shocked by this.
Five years ago, the Italian master Pasolini—who delivered *Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom* as his final message before being brutally murdered by a youth said to be his lover—filmed *Apollo's Hell*, based on the Oedipus myth. At that time, he confessed that this was "not about abstract or immediate problems, but what I myself have survived," openly revealing that he had been in an incestuous relationship with his own mother.
Perhaps one day, a law prohibiting mother-son incest will be established in our country. Conversely, the time may also come when other nations look to Japan and choose to deregulate such prohibitions. This is simply unknown to this writer, who is neither a legal expert nor a professional researcher.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Field | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Scholarly/Editorial Commentary (論説/論評) or critical essay, dealing with contemporary sensationalism through the lens of myth, psychoanalysis, and celebrity scandal. |
| **Author Attribution** | Unattributed (anonymous author/editor). Explicitly states: "This writer, who is neither a lawyer nor a researcher." |
| **Editorial Voice** | Highly analytical and intellectual, yet infused with sensationalist elements typical of *Kitan Club*. The voice is transgressive, discussing taboo subjects clinically but drawing focus to the "highest ecstasy" of violation. |
| **Target Audience** | Readers interested in high-brow scandal, psychoanalytic theory (Freud/Oedipus), avant-garde European cinema, and extreme sexual themes (Ero-Guro). |
| **External References** | Mentions "柿沼氏" (Kakinuma), "密室の母と子" (The Mother and Child in the Secret Room, likely a contemporary piece of fiction/reportage), Pier Paolo Pasolini (Italian filmmaker, murdered 1975), *Sodom no Ichi* (Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, 1975), and *Apollo no Jigoku* (Apollo's Hell, likely *Oedipus Rex*, 1967). |
| **Positioning/Dating** | The reference to Pasolini's murder "Five years ago" (he died Nov 1975) strongly dates this piece to **circa 1980–1981**, placing it in the late Showa period and the final years of the magazine's run. |
| **Layout Context** | The text flows around an illustration (implied sexual embrace/dominance) and concludes the column on page 35. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

1.  **Mother-Son Incest (母子相姦) as a Postwar Trope:** After WWII, Japanese society grappled with the erosion of traditional family structures and morality. Psychoanalytic concepts, especially the Oedipus complex, were widely discussed in intellectual and popular magazines, often serving as a gateway to explore transgressive sexuality. *Kitan Club* capitalized on this intellectual veneer to discuss raw taboo subjects.
2.  **Transgression of the Sacred (神聖なもの):** This concept is central to the Ero-Guro movement. The violation of figures deemed pure (nuns, teachers, mothers, high school girls) is explicitly defined as the source of "highest ecstasy." This reflects a psychological rejection of established post-war moral order and pre-war Imperial purity standards.
3.  **Oedipus Myth:** The text uses the classical Oedipus (accidental incest, self-punishment) as a contrast to the "modern Oedipus," who engages in incest and extreme sexual acts (forced masturbation, oral sex/ejaculation) casually. This highlights the perceived moral decay or radical sexual frankness of the contemporary era compared to classical tragedy.
4.  **Pasolini and *Sodom no Ichi***: The reference to Pier Paolo Pasolini is a key historical marker. His film *Salò* (1975), a brutal allegory of fascism and power through sexual violence, was highly controversial globally and represents the extreme edge of modernist art and transgression. Pasolini's murder in 1975 and the subsequent revelation of his own admission of incestuous feelings (or relationships) provided sensational material that linked high-art transgression with real-life scandal, perfectly suited for *Kitan Club*'s format.
5.  ***Apollo no Jigoku***: This likely refers to Pasolini's 1967 film *Edipo Re* (Oedipus Rex), which visually and thematically explores the Oedipal complex in a modernist, primal setting.
6.  **Legal Context:** The final paragraph discussing potential laws against mother-son incest (which was generally covered under general obscenity or assault laws, but not specifically defined as a separate crime in the way father-daughter incest often was) reflects the ongoing socio-legal negotiation of sexual boundaries in Japan during the late Showa period.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (JP) | Reading (JP) | Meaning | Context / Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **母子相姦** | *boshi sōkan* | Mother-son incest | The central taboo subject. |
| **神聖なもの** | *shinsei na mono* | Sacred things/objects | The objects of violation; includes the mother, nuns, teachers. |
| **汚す・犯す** | *yogosu / okasu* | To defile / to violate (rape) | The active verbs defining the source of erotic thrill (transgression). |
| **尼僧** | *nisō* | Nun | Represents religious purity, making violation highly transgressive. |
| **戴ひ合つた** | *idahiatta* (historical) | Embraced each other | Euphemism for sexual intercourse, used here to describe the mother-son act. |
| **えぐり取つて** | *eguritorutte* | Gouge out | Refers to Oedipus' self-mutilation, used to emphasize the severity of the original myth vs. the modern casualization. |
| **ひ弱** | *hiyowa* | Frail; spineless | Used to describe the "modern Oedipus" in the fictional work cited. |
| **マスターベーション** | *masutābēshon* | Masturbation | Explicit sexual term used clinically to describe the modern Oedipus' demand of his mother. |
| **射精** | *shasei* | Ejaculation | Explicit sexual term, describing the act into the mother's mouth (oral sex). |
| **巨匠** | *kyoshō* | Master/Maestro | Used to refer to Pasolini, granting him high artistic status despite the scandalous context. |

## Themes & Subtext

1.  **The Loss of Taboo (Desacralization):** The dominant theme is the disappearance of the sacred in modern life. The ultimate erotic experience is derived from violating the most absolute of taboos (the mother), confirming that if the mother is merely human, nothing is truly sacred.
2.  **Psychoanalysis and Perversion:** The essay is deeply rooted in Freudian analysis, using Oedipus as the core framework. The modern iteration of Oedipus is not tragic but purely perverse and hedonistic—he seeks pleasure from the violation, not cosmic fate.
3.  **Voyeurism and Sensationalism:** By contrasting the Greek myth (tragic, self-blinding) with the modern depiction (casual, at the dining table), the text justifies the modern Ero-Guro fascination. The implied fantasy is not the dramatic fate of Oedipus, but the sustained, normalized perversion of the "mother and son embracing and then having dinner."
4.  **Artistic Transgression:** The inclusion of Pasolini serves to link Japanese pulp sensationalism to high European art/cinema, suggesting that the drive for transgression is universal and legitimate, even if leading to personal ruin (Pasolini's murder and confession).
5.  **Shame and Power:** The "highest ecstasy" is defined as exercising power over the sacred object, reducing it to the level of the self or lower. This is an articulation of sexual domination driven by the desire to flatten hierarchical social structures, especially the primal mother/child hierarchy.
