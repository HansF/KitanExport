女性の肉体を狙う

美しき小鳩は……
……鷲に狙われている

**一、職業婦人を釣る廣告の裏**

孝子（たかこ）は洋館の大邸宅を訪れていた。
彼女は新聞で「婦人秘書採用」とゆふ廣告を見て、履歴書を送り、今朝面談したいとゆふ手紙を受取つて、早速その廣告主を訪れて来たのであつた。
先づ彼女を驚かしたのは、その堂々たる邸宅であつた。そして、その主人の秘書になる自分を考えると、孝子はその身なりのあまりにもみすぼらしいのが悲しかつた。
玄関に立つた彼女は、思いきつて呼鈴のボタンを押した。奥の方にそれが反響すると間もなく一人の少女が取次に出た。
「あの私お手紙を頂いて参つたものでございますが……」
「どうぞお上り下さい」
立派な應接室で暫く待つていると、今度は又別の少女が見えて、主人の室へ案内して行つた。孝子が恐る〜入つてゆくと、主人は打ち解けた態度で彼女を迎え入れた。
「あゝ、あなたが岩佐孝子さんでいらつしやいますか、大へんいい御体格ですね。私のところでは健康が何よりですから、あなたのような体格の方なら、もうそれだけで理想的です。一つお働き願うことに致しましよう」
主人は立ちどころにきめてしまつた。
仕事とゆうのは書類の下調べと、往復文書の整理とゆうことで、月給は最初四千円、なるべく泊込みを歓迎するとゆうようなことを、彼女は聞かされた。
両親弟妹を混えて五人家族が狭い裏長屋の六畳一間に團子（だんご）のようになつて暮していた孝子は飛び立つばかりに喜んだ。そして翌日衣類や化粧道具等一通りを小型のトランクに詰めてその邸宅に移つて行つた。
二三日はこれとゆふ仕事もなく、新聞や雑誌を読んで過ごした。たゞ主人の話相手をして一緒にお茶を飲んだりした。

**こんな話もあります**
**でんすけに肉体を賭けた女**
――でんすけ賭博――

ビースの箱三個の中の一個に白を抉（えぐ）つて印をつけこれを新聞紙を貼つた石油箱の上で、賭博屋が、手練の指先で操作しつつ、並べたビースの箱の、どの一つが背中が白いかを当てさせる賭博だ。
「白当り、青ダメ。これ白、背中白い、これ無いのみなダメ。そら白どつこい行つた。これ当る。五百円賭ける五百円渡す。千円賭ける千円渡す。私たち親分ある。金いくら出しても親分の金。私、損ない。いくら賭けても出す」
とやつている。日本人でもわざと自分の国の言葉をカタコトにしているようだ。
この賭博は全國津々浦々盛り場という盛り場には必ずこの連中が見世を張つているから、皆様も見られた事と思う。
群衆の肩を押し分けて、これを見物するのが私は好きだ。
百円札四枚をカシワに折り五枚目をその帯に逆に折り込んだ五百円包を無操作にポケットに放り込んで、出し入れしているのを見て

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Targeting the flesh of women.
**A Hundred Forms of Seduction Demons**
By Shinzō Tsumura
Illustration by Mitsuhira

(Inside Illustration):
The beautiful little dove is...
...being targeted by an eagle.

**1. Behind the advertisement for fishing for career women**

Takako was visiting a large Western-style mansion. 
She had seen an advertisement in the newspaper saying "Hiring Lady Secretary," sent her resume, received a letter saying [they] wanted to interview this morning, and had promptly come to visit the advertiser. 
First, what surprised her was that imposing mansion. And, thinking of herself becoming the secretary of that master, Takako was sad that her appearance was so very shabby.
Standing at the entrance, she decisively pressed the doorbell button. When it echoed in the back, before long, one young girl came out to attend. 
"Um, I am the one who received the letter and came, but..."
"Please, come up."
Waiting for a while in a fine reception room, this time again another girl appeared and guided her to the master's room. As Takako entered fearfully-fearfully, the master welcomed her with an open-hearted attitude.
"Ah, are you Miss Takako Iwasa? You have a very good physique. Because health is more important than anything at my place, if it is someone of a physique like yours, already with just that it is ideal. Let's decide to have you work [here]."
The master decided right on the spot.
Regarding the work, it was investigation of documents and organizing correspondence, and she was told things like the monthly salary would be initially 4,000 yen, and [he] welcomed live-in arrangements as much as possible.
Takako, who lived with her parents and younger siblings, a five-person family, in a single six-tatami room of a narrow back-alley tenement, crowded like dumplings, was so happy she could almost fly. And the next day, packing a set of clothes, makeup tools, etc., into a small trunk, she moved to that mansion.
For two or three days, there was no work to speak of, and she spent time reading newspapers and magazines. She just acted as a conversation partner for the master and drank tea together.

**There is also a story like this**
**The woman who bet her body on Densuke**
—Densuke Gambling—

It is a gamble where, having gouged a mark into one of three Peace [cigarette] boxes to mark it white, the gambler, while operating with practiced fingertips on top of an oil box covered in newspaper, has [the player] guess which one of the lined-up Peace boxes has a white back.
"White is a hit, blue is no good. This is white, back is white, these without it are all no good. There, white has gone 'dokkoi.' This will hit. Bet 500 yen, I give 500 yen. Bet 1,000 yen, I give 1,000 yen. We have a boss. No matter how much money is put out, it's the boss's money. I have no loss. No matter how much is bet, I put it out."
...is what they are doing. Even if they are Japanese, it seems they purposely speak their own country's language in broken baby-talk.
Because this gambling, in every single entertainment district across the country, these fellows certainly set up shop, I think everyone has seen it.
Pushing through the shoulders of the crowd, I like watching this.
Seeing [them] carelessly toss into their pocket a 500-yen bundle made by folding four 100-yen notes into a 'kashiwa' [square] and folding a fifth one in reverse into the band, and taking it in and out...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Targeting the Flesh of Women: A Hundred Guises of the Seducer**
Written by Shinzō Tsumura
Illustrated by Mitsuhira

(Inside the central illustration):
*The innocent dove is marked...*
*...by the predatory eagle.*

**I. The Sinister Reality Behind Ads for "Career Women"**

Takako stood before the gates of a sprawling Western-style manor. Drawn by a newspaper classified seeking a "Lady Secretary," she had sent off her resume and received a prompt summons for an interview that very morning. Her heart sank as she looked at the imposing residence; her own clothes felt painfully shabby at the prospect of serving such a master.

Taking a deep breath, she pressed the buzzer. A young maid soon appeared and ushered her inside. After a brief wait in a lavish drawing room, another girl led her to the master’s private study. Takako entered with trepidation, but the master greeted her with surprising warmth.

"Ah, so you are Miss Takako Iwasa. A fine, sturdy build you have! Health is my primary concern here, and your vitality alone makes you the ideal candidate. Consider yourself hired."

The decision was instantaneous. He explained that her duties would involve reviewing documents and filing correspondence. The starting salary was a princely 4,000 yen a month, with the added "request" that she live on the premises. For Takako, who lived crammed like sardines with her parents and three siblings in a tiny one-room tenement, this seemed like a dream come true. The very next day, she packed her meager belongings into a small trunk and moved into the mansion.

For the first few days, there was no real work to be done. She spent her hours leafing through magazines, serving as little more than a companion to the master over tea. Little did she know the trap that was closing around her...

**A Sidebar: The Woman Who Bet Her Body on the Street**
*—The Scourge of "Densuke" Gambling—*

The game is simple: three empty Peace cigarette boxes, one marked with a hidden white notch. The grifter, with lightning-fast fingers, shuffles them across a newspaper-covered oil crate while the marks try to guess which one holds the prize. 

"White's the winner, blue's a loser! Look at the white one go! Bet five hundred, get five hundred back! Bet a thousand, get a thousand! The boss provides the bankroll—it's not my money, so I've got nothing to lose! Step up and place your bets!" 

The barkers often affect a strange, broken dialect, even if they are clearly Japanese, to add an air of exotic mystery. You can find these dens of iniquity in any entertainment district across the nation; no doubt you’ve seen them yourselves. I've always found it fascinating to watch the crowds. I once saw a man carelessly stuffing 500-yen bundles—four 100-yen notes folded into a square with a fifth wrapped around them—into his pocket as if they were scrap paper...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page uses a classic vertical orientation typical of Japanese magazines. The main title "誘惑魔百態" (A Hundred Forms of Seducing Demons) uses a stylized, slightly "shook" or dripping font to evoke a sense of danger, mystery, and pulp sensationalism.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and the large, circular illustration dominate the top third of the page. The illustration—a woman (dove) being stalked by a predator (eagle)—is a heavy-handed but effective metaphor for the "warning" theme of the article.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is divided into two distinct sections. The top half is the beginning of a serialized "true crime" or "cautionary tale" style fiction. The bottom right is a shorter, perhaps non-fiction editorial sidebar about street gambling.
*   **Pagination:** The page number (43) is at the very bottom center in parentheses.
*   **Visual Elements:** The use of "Peace" cigarette boxes and oil crates in the gambling description provides a gritty, realistic texture that contrasts with the "high-class" Western mansion in the main story.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s/Early 1950s):** The mention of 100-yen notes (*hyakuen-satsu*) and 4,000 yen salaries places this in the early post-war period. In the late 40s, 4,000 yen was a significant monthly wage (the average starting salary for a teacher was around 2,000-3,000 yen).
*   **Shokugyō Fujin (Career Women):** This term gained popularity in the Taisho and early Showa eras. In the post-war chaos, many young women were desperate for work to support families, making them targets for employment scams or "predatory" employers.
*   **Western-style Houses (Yōkan):** These were symbols of extreme wealth and often carried an air of "foreign" mystery or moral decadence in popular fiction of the time.
*   **Densuke Gambling (Densuke-tobaku):** This was a notorious street scam, essentially a shell game using cigarette boxes. The name "Densuke" reportedly comes from a popular comic character of the time. It was a common sight in the black markets (*yami-ichi*) and entertainment districts of bombed-out Japanese cities.
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** This page is almost certainly from a *kasutori* magazine. These were cheap, tawdry, short-lived publications that flourished in the post-war ruins, focusing on "3 S's": Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports (or Scandals). They often featured "true accounts" of the underworld.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **誘惑魔 (Yūwakuma):** Literally "Seduction Demon." A classic pulp-era term for a predatory male or a "femme fatale" (though usually used for men targeting women in this context).
*   **百態 (Hyakutai):** "A hundred forms" or "all various aspects." This implies a long-running series or a comprehensive exposé.
*   **でんすけ (Densuke):** The specific name for the shell-game scam described in the text.
*   **裏長屋 (Ura-nagaya):** A back-alley tenement house. These were the standard low-income housing for the urban poor, emphasizing the protagonist’s poverty.
*   **カタコト (Katakoto):** Broken speech or baby talk. The text notes that the gamblers used a fake "foreign" or "low-class" accent to lure in victims.
*   **カシワ (Kashiwa):** Referring to *kashiwa-ori*, a way of folding paper (or money) into a specific square shape, named after the *kashiwa* (oak) leaf used in sweets.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Predatory Capitalism & Post-War Desperation:** The main story highlights the extreme vulnerability of young women in the post-war economy. Takako’s desperation to move her family out of a one-room tenement makes her ignore the "too good to be true" nature of the job.
*   **The "Invisible" Threat:** The story frames the employer not as a monster, but as a "refined" gentleman in a Western mansion, emphasizing that danger often wears a mask of civility.
*   **Class Anxiety:** The contrast between the *nagaya* (tenement) and the *yōkan* (mansion) drives the narrative. The master’s comment on Takako’s "physique" suggests she is being viewed as livestock or an object rather than an employee.
*   **Street Life & Cynicism:** The sidebar on *Densuke* gambling offers a cynical look at the "entertainment" of the ruins. The author admits to enjoying watching the marks get swindled, reflecting a certain hardened, post-war sensibility.
