花の子戦術
原 紅太郎

**[Main Text]**
（一）
春のペーベントには、陽炎が燃えていた。その下の地の底では、地下鉄が満員の乗客を孕んで、あえぐように走っている。
車内は身動きもならぬ雑踏で、車の動揺のたびに人の波が右に左に翻弄されている。
花子達には、ここが絶好の稼ぎ場所である。今丁度ヤミ屋らしい中年の黒ジャンバー姿の男に花子は前から子分の新吉は後から、ぴったりと身体を押しつけてチャンスを狙っているところだった。
さりとは夢々御存じないヤミ屋の親爺は、花子の美しい顔を盗むように見ては、にやり、にやりとほくそ笑んでいる。とゆうのは車の動揺のたびに、ぎゅううんと押してくる花子の柔かい肉体の感触を、思わぬ儲けものとばかりに秘かに楽しんでいるところだったからだ。車内の誰も彼もぎゅうぎゅう押合っている時とて、それを特に変に思う者も、又特にそれへ注目する者もなかった。彼はいつか露骨に喋った仕草までやりだした。
――ヘンこの助平め――花子は今に見ろと思いつつ、素知らぬ顔をしている。
まもなく新吉の方へチラリと何やら眼信号をきらめかす花子の。
――おいきた合図――無言のまま頷く新吉。いよ〜彼の役目の作業に取りかゝった。彼の作業はカモを押し戻したり突いたりして注意をその方へ反らせようとするのだ。
彼等の良きカモであるそのヤミ屋は、あまりに執拗な背後のいたづらに、今迄の陶酔気分をすっかり毀されてしまった。
――うるさい、何をするんだ――と、むっとした顔で振向いた其の瞬間！花子の指先は素早く活動した。そしてもう既に虫も殺さぬような素知らぬ顔つき。
ところが、まもなくそれに氣づくに男の相手と言うものは、そう簡単に得る事が出来なくて、悶々の月日を送っている悩みの女性を救い、且つはお慰め申すのが、斯く言う男妾である。
この遊閑婦人の慰安所が目下阿倍野と阪急沿線に二つある。
露地の奥まったところに素人風の一軒を構え、観音様とは見れば、口髭を生やし、眼鏡をかけた四十がらみの、体重十七八貫もあるかと思える偉丈夫。
ちょっと見たところ好き者には見えないが、どうしてどうして精力絶倫、なにしろうえきった女や、淫乱の変態性女のお相手をつかまる仕事だけに……
天王寺や大門通りにポンビキを派遣し、これこれと思う女に
「面白い処へ御案内しましょうか、へい、どうです」
と誘いかける、大概の女はちょと意味がわからず途まどいするが、耳に口を寄せ
「奇麗な男さんですよ」
等と言えば、「失礼な」と柳眉を逆立てるものもいるが、此方も商賣柄睨んだ目に誤りはなく、先づ黙ってついてくるものが多い。
ショートタイムなら三、四百圓、泊りは十時頃からで千圓から千二百圓と言つたところで、パンパンよりは余程高い、やはり男の方が女より値打ちがあると見える。
お好みに應じてどんなサービスでも致しますが、此んな所へ遊びに来る女は好き者と見えて、やたらに回敷を多く要求したり、又女だてらに特別サービス一点張りと言うのもあって、男妾も又辛いかなである。
然し一晩、平均四、五人の客があり花代がそっくり手取りとなるから月収一万五千圓から二万圓にはなるから、此の商業、中々もつてやめられぬ。
買いに来るお客は、二十七、八才以上の年増で、流石にそれ以下は、何にも錢を出して男を買わなくとも、女人到る處男子ありと言うわけでもあるまいが、来ためしがない。
六十に手がとどく、全く色気だけが残っていると言った老婆も現れることがあるから、大岡越前守の母の言葉ではないが、
「此の道ばかりは灰になるまで！」
×　　　×　　　×
更に筆を進むれば、契約結婚（短期結婚）婦人アパート、下等淫賣、木賃宿等、あれこれと興味ある珍名所も多いが、長くなったので一應これで筆を擱き後日の楽しみにしたい。

男の相手と言うものは、そう簡単に得ることができなくて、悶々の月日を送っている悩みの女性を救い、かつはお慰め申すのが、こう言う「男妾（だんしょう）」である。
この有閑婦人の慰安所が目下、阿倍野と阪急沿線に二つある。
路地の奥まったところに素人風の一軒を構え、主（あるじ）を見れば、口髭を生やし、眼鏡をかけた四十がらみの、体重十七、八貫（約64-68kg）もあるかと思える偉丈夫。
ちょっと見たところ、数寄者（すきもの）には見えないが、どうしてどうして精力絶倫。なにしろ飢えきった女や、淫乱な変態女性のお相手を務める仕事だけに……。
天王寺や大門通りにポン引きを派遣し、これこれと思う女に「面白いところへご案内しましょうか、へい、どうです」と誘いかける。大概の女はちょっと意味がわからず戸惑いするが、耳に口を寄せ「綺麗な男さんですよ」などと言えば、「失礼な」と柳眉を逆立てるものもいるが、こちらも商売柄、睨んだ目に誤りはなく、まず黙ってついてくるものが多い。
ショートタイムなら三、四百円、泊まりは十時頃からで千円から千二百円といったところで、パンパンよりは余程高い。やはり男の方が女より値打ちがあると見える。
お好みに応じてどんなサービスでもいたしますが、こんな所へ遊びに来る女は好き者と見えて、やたらに回数を多く要求したり、また女だてらに「特別サービス一点張り」というのもあって、男妾もまた辛いものである。
しかし一晩、平均四、五人の客があり、花代がそっくり手取りとなるから、月収一万五千円から二万円にはなる。この商売、なかなかやめられぬ。
買いに来るお客は、二十七、八歳以上の年増で、流石にそれ以下は、何にも金を出して男を買わなくとも、女人至る所に男子ありというわけでもあるまいが、来た例がない。
六十に手が届く、全く色気だけが残っていると言った老婆も現れることがあるから、大岡越前守の母の言葉ではないが、「この道ばかりは灰になるまで！」

In the spring pavement, heat haze was burning. In the depths of the ground below that, the subway, pregnant with full-capacity passengers, is running as if gasping.
The inside of the car is a congestion where even moving is impossible; with every shaking of the car, the wave of people is being toyed with to the right and to the left.
For Hanako and her group, this is the perfect earning place. Right now, against a middle-aged man in a black jacket who looks like a black-marketeer, Hanako from the front and her subordinate Shinkichi from behind were pressing their bodies tightly and aiming for a chance.
The black-marketeer old man, who knows absolutely nothing of this, looks as if stealing a glance at Hanako's beautiful face and is smirking "niyari, niyari." This is because, with every shaking of the car, he was secretly enjoying the sensation of Hanako's soft flesh pressing "gyuuun" against him, thinking it an unexpected windfall. Since everyone in the car was pressing "gyuu-gyuu" against each other, there was no one who thought it particularly strange or paid attention to it. He eventually began even blatant gestures.
"--Hmph, this lecher--" Hanako thinks "just you wait" while keeping an innocent face.
Before long, Hanako flickers some kind of eye-signal toward Shinkichi.
"--Hey, the 'it's come' signal--" Shinkichi nods wordlessly. Finally, he set about his role's work. His work is to push back or poke the "duck" (mark) to divert his attention that way.
That black-marketeer, who is their good "duck," had his previous intoxicated mood completely destroyed by the too-persistent mischief from behind.
"--Shut up, what are you doing!--" At that moment he turned around with a miffed face! Hanako's fingertips actively moved with speed. And then, she already had an innocent face as if she wouldn't even kill a bug.
(...)
As for a male partner, such a thing cannot be obtained so easily; the one who saves and consoles troubled women spending days in agony is what is called a "male concubine" (male prostitute).
Comfort stations for these idle ladies currently exist in two places: Abeno and along the Hankyu line.
Setting up an amateur-looking house in the back of an alleyway, if you look at the master, he is a great man around forty, with a mustache and glasses, weighing about 17-18 kan (64-68kg).
At a glance, he doesn't look like a lecher, but on the contrary, he has peerless energy. After all, because it is a job of serving starving women or lewd, perverted women...
Sending "touts" to Tennoji or Daimon-dori, they call out to women they think are "this and that": "Shall I guide you to an interesting place? How about it?" Most women are confused, not understanding the meaning, but when he leans to the ear and says "He's a beautiful man," some raise their eyebrows saying "How rude," but his eyes, trained by trade, make no mistake, and most come along in silence.
For a short time it's 300-400 yen; staying over starts from 10 PM and is 1,000 to 1,200 yen—quite a bit higher than a "Pan-pan." It seems men have more value than women after all.

**The Strategy of the Flower-Girl**
By Kotaro Hara

**(1)**
Heat shimmered off the pavement this spring day. Deep beneath the surface, the subway labored along, its cars pregnant with a crush of gasping commuters. The interior was a claustrophobic sea of bodies, tossed left and right with every lurch of the train.

For Hanako and her crew, this was the perfect hunting ground. She had identified a mark—a middle-aged man in a black jacket who reeked of the black market. Hanako pressed in from the front while her accomplice, Shinkichi, squeezed in tight from behind, waiting for the moment to strike.

Utterly oblivious to the trap, the old black-marketeer stole glances at Hanako’s pretty face, a greasy smirk playing on his lips. He was privately reveling in the sensation of her soft body being crushed against him by the train's motion, viewing it as a delightful, unexpected bonus to his day. In the "gyu-gyu" crush of the morning rush, no one spared them a second glance. Emboldened, the man began to make increasingly lewd, overt movements.

*Hmph, you lecherous pig,* Hanako thought, maintaining a mask of cool indifference. *Just you wait.*

Soon, she caught Shinkichi’s eye and gave a sharp, fleeting signal.

*Here we go,* Shinkichi signaled back with a silent nod. He began his part of the job: shoving and poking the "duck" from behind to keep his attention diverted. Frustrated by the persistent irritation at his back, the black-marketeer’s erotic reverie was shattered.

"Hey! Watch it! What do you think you're doing?" he snapped, whipping around in a huff. In that split second, Hanako’s fingers blurred into motion. By the time he looked back, she already wore a look of such angelic innocence you’d think she couldn't hurt a fly.

[...]

Finding a male companion is no easy feat for some. The man who "rescues" and "consoles" these women languishing in lonely boredom is known as a *dansho*—a male prostitute. Currently, two of these "comfort stations" for idle wives operate in Abeno and along the Hankyu line.

Tucked away at the end of an alley, the establishment looks like an ordinary home. The proprietor is an imposing figure in his forties, mustachioed and bespectacled, weighing nearly 150 pounds. He doesn't look like a libertine, but his stamina is legendary—a necessity, given his clientele of "starving" or "deviant" women.

He dispatches touts to Tennoji and Daimon-dori to scout for prospects. "Care for a trip to somewhere interesting?" they'll whisper. Most women are confused at first, but when the tout leans in and murmurs, "He's a real beauty," some might take offense, but many—spotted by the tout’s practiced eye—simply follow in silence.

A "short time" costs three to four hundred yen. An overnight stay from 10 PM runs a thousand to twelve hundred—significantly steeper than the rates for "Pan-pan" girls. It seems, in this market, a man’s time is worth more than a woman’s.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is formatted for a mass-market magazine or a cheap paperback (*bunkobon*). It features a vertical layout typical of Japanese literature.
*   **Visual Elements:** The title "花の子戦術" (The Strategy of the Flower-Girl) is presented in a stylized, bold typeface with a background graphic that resembles a silhouette of a building or a tower (possibly the Tsutenkaku in Osaka, given the geographic references).
*   **Structure:** The story is divided into numbered sections, suggesting a serialized format. The use of "× × ×" as a section break indicates a transition between scenes or themes.
*   **Typography:** The text includes furigana (reading aids) for difficult kanji (e.g., 陽炎 - *kagerō*). The use of long dashes (――) for internal monologue or dialogue is a standard literary convention of the era.
*   **Page Numbering:** The number "6" at the bottom suggests this is near the beginning of the publication or a specific story segment.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** The late 1940s to early 1950s (the Occupation period). This is evident from the mention of *yami-ya* (black marketeers) and *Pan-pan* (streetwalkers who served Allied soldiers).
*   **Geography:** The text mentions **Abeno**, **Tennoji**, and the **Hankyu Line**, placing the setting firmly in **Osaka**. Post-war Osaka was a hub for black markets and the "Kasutori" pulp culture.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term "Kasutori" refers to cheap, sensationalist magazines that flourished after the war. They often focused on "the three S's": Sport, Screen (movies), and Sex. The grit and illicit sexuality in this text are hallmarks of the genre.
*   **Social Class:** The text contrasts the "black marketeer" (newly rich but low-class) with "idle wives" (*yukan-funin*) who have the money to pay for male companionship.
*   **Economic Context:** The prices mentioned (300-1200 yen) reflect the hyperinflation and subsequent stabilization of the post-war yen. For context, in the late 40s, a starting salary for a teacher might have been around 2,000-3,000 yen a month. The "male prostitute" earning 20,000 yen a month would have been incredibly wealthy by comparison.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ヤミ屋 (Yami-ya):** Black market dealers who thrived during the post-war shortage of goods.
*   **パンパン (Pan-pan):** A colloquial/derogatory term for Japanese prostitutes who catered to the US Occupation forces.
*   **ポン引き (Pon-biki):** A tout or pimp who lures customers to illegal brothels or gambling dens.
*   **男妾 (Dansho):** Literally "male concubine," used here to refer to a male prostitute for women.
*   **ぎゅうぎゅう (Gyu-gyu):** Onomatopoeia for a tight squeeze, synonymous with the "commuter hell" of Japanese trains.
*   **カモ (Kamo):** Literally "duck," slang for a "mark" or an easy target for a scam or theft.
*   **柳眉を逆立てる (Ryubi o sakadateru):** "To raise one's willow-like eyebrows"—an idiom meaning a woman is getting angry/indignant.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Urban Jungle:** The train is depicted as a place of struggle and predation where the crowd provides cover for crime (pickpocketing) and harassment.
*   **Survival and Cunning:** Hanako is not a victim; she is a predator using her beauty and the man's lechery to facilitate a crime.
*   **Gender and Value:** The author makes a pointed (and cynical) observation that male prostitutes cost more than "Pan-pan" girls, suggesting a supply-and-demand hierarchy in the post-war sexual economy.
*   **Eroticism and Voyeurism:** The text functions as "edutainment"—part story, part "reportage" on the seedy underbelly of Osaka, designed to titillate the male reader with descriptions of "starving" and "perverted" women.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Pulp/Noir), Social Commentary.
*   **Genre:** *Kasutori* literature, Crime fiction.
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Black Market, Prostitution, Pickpocketing, Urban Life, Gender Relations.
