**盛り場いんちきブギウギ**
**門　好太郎**

**第一話　すばらしい拾い物**

秋の夜は長いが、飲んでいると時間のたつのがわからない。
「あれ？、もう十一時だぜ、阪急の終発におくれたらたいへんだ、じゃあ失敬！」
僕は悪友たちに挨拶すると、カバンを抱いて、あわてゝ酒場をとび出した。曽根崎の裏町だから梅田はすぐそこだ。さすがに十月といえばしっとりと肌寒い。いつものように地下道の階段を下りて、うすぐらいところをすたすたと急いでいると、ふいに後ろから
「もしもし、ちょっと」
と声をかけられた。まわりに人影はないし、僕のことにちがいない。まさか追剥（おいはぎ）じゃなかろうし、僕は警戒しながら、ふっと立ちどまった。
「これは旦那の時計ちがいいますか？」
ハンカチにつゝんだ丸い平べったい物を手の上にのせて近寄って来たのは、ルンペンみたいな、うす汚い男だった。僕も、亡くなった親父の形見の懐中時計をもっている。そういわれて、反射的に僕はチョッキのポケツトを探ってみた。やれやれ一安心、僕の時計はコチコチとぶじに時を刻んでいる。
「いや、ありがとう、僕のじゃなかった」
「そうですかい、ふん、いい時計だな、こりゃ旦那、たしかに金側（きんがわ）ですなあ、誰が落したか知らんが、すばらしい金目のものですぜ」
ルンペンが感心するのに引かれて僕ものぞきこんだ。うすぐらい地下道の電燈の下だがチカリと純金らしく光っている。
「旦那、いくらぐらいの値打ちがします？」
「うん、純金だったら一万円はするだろう」
「一万円？、そうですかい、みすみす警察へ届けて五百円や千円のお礼をもらうのもばかばかしいや…」
すばやくまわりをじろりと見渡したルンペンは声をひそめて僕にさゝやいた。
「旦那、どうです、知ってるのはあんたとわたしだけだ、こいつを売って、二人で五千円ずつ山分けにしませんかえへへ」
拾い物を猫ババするなんてのはおもしろくない。しかし、酔っていた僕はふっと魔がさした。だまってうなずくと、
「じゃあねえ、旦那、わしみたいなルンペンが売りに行っちゃきっと怪しまれるから、御苦労だが、旦那ちょいと地下道を上ったとこの時計屋までこいつを売りに行って下さいよ、まだ起きているはずだし、旦那のような紳士なら向うが安心してすぐ金にしてくれますあ…」
こゝで待っているからというルンペンに僕はカバンを預けると、その時計を持って、教えられた通りの時計屋へいそいだ。
「旅費を落してこまっているいるんだが、この時計を買ってくれないか」
というと、時計屋のオヤジは二つ返事で
「へえ、じゃあ一つとっくり拝見」
と例の時計を明るいスタンドランプの下で調べ始めた。
一万円？　一万五千円？、僕は胸をどきどきさせてオヤジの返事を待った。

（中略・下段コラム）

秋の夜は長いが、飲んでいると時間の経つのを忘れてしまう。
「あれ？　もう十一時だ。阪急の最終電車に遅れたら大変だ、じゃあ失敬！」
私は悪友たちに挨拶すると、鞄を抱えて慌てて酒場を飛び出した。曽根崎の裏町だから梅田はすぐそこだ。さすがに十月と言えばしっとりと肌寒い。いつものように地下道の階段を下りて、薄暗いところをすたすたと急いでいると、不意に後ろから
「もしもし、ちょっと」
と声をかけられた。周りに人影はないし、私に違いない。まさか追剥（おいはぎ）ではないだろうし、私は警戒しながら、ふと立ち止まった。
「これは旦那の時計ではありませんか？」
ハンカチに包んだ丸い平べったい物を手の上に乗せて近寄ってきたのは、ルンペンのような、薄汚い男だった。私も、亡くなった親父の形見の懐中時計を持っている。そう言われて、反射的に私はチョッキのポケットを探ってみた。やれやれ一安心、私の時計はカチカチと無事に時を刻んでいる。
「いや、ありがとう、私のではないよ」
「そうですか。ふん、いい時計だな。これ旦那、確かに金側（きんがわ）ですよ。誰が落としたか知りませんが、素晴らしい金目の物ですぜ」
ルンペンが感心するのに引かれて私も覗き込んだ。薄暗い地下道の電灯の下だが、キラリと純金らしく光っている。
「旦那、いくらぐらいの値打ちがします？」
「うん、純金だったら一万円はするだろう」
「一万円？　そうですか。みすみす警察へ届けて五百円や千円のお礼をもらうのも馬鹿馬鹿しいな……」
素早く周りをじろりと見渡したルンペンは、声を潜めて私に囁いた。
「旦那、どうです。知っているのはあんたと私だけだ。こいつを売って、二人で五千円ずつ山分けにしませんか。へへへ」
拾い物をネコババするというのは感心しない。しかし、酔っていた私はふっと魔が差した。黙って頷くと、
「じゃあねえ、旦那。私のようなルンペンが売りに行けばきっと怪しまれるから。ご苦労だが、旦那、ちょっと地下道を上がった所の時計屋までこいつを売りに行ってくださいよ。まだ起きているはずだし、旦那のような紳士なら向こうも安心してすぐ現金にしてくれますよ……」

**Kado Kotaro**

**Episode 1: A Wonderful Find**

Autumn nights are long, but when drinking, the passage of time is not known.
"Huh? It's already 11 o'clock. If I miss the last Hankyu train, it'll be terrible. Well, excuse me!"
I greeted my bad friends, hugged my bag, and hurriedly rushed out of the bar. Since it was the backstreets of Sonezaki, Umeda was right there. As expected for October, it was damply chilly. As usual, descending the stairs of the underground passage, as I was walking briskly through a dim area, suddenly from behind,
"Excuse me, hey,"
I was called out to. There were no other figures around, so it must be me. It wouldn't be a highwayman, surely; I stopped suddenly while being on guard.
"Is this your watch, sir?"
The one who approached, putting a round, flat object wrapped in a handkerchief on his hand, was a dirty man looking like a *lumpen* (homeless person). I also have a pocket watch, a memento from my late father. Being told that, reflexively I searched my vest pocket. Phew, a relief; my watch was ticking away safely.
"No, thanks, it wasn't mine."
"Is that so? Hmm, it's a good watch. Look, sir, it's definitely gold-cased. Don't know who dropped it, but it's a wonderful valuable item."
Drawn by the lumpen's admiration, I also peered in. Though under the dim underground passage light, it glinted like pure gold.
"Sir, about how much value does it have?"
"Well, if it's pure gold, it would be worth 10,000 yen."
"10,000 yen? Is that so? It's foolish to just hand it to the police and get a 500 or 1,000 yen reward..."
Quickly glancing around, the lumpen lowered his voice and whispered to me.
"Sir, how about it? Only you and I know. Let's sell this and split it 5,000 yen each. Hehehe."
Embezzling a found item isn't good. However, being drunk, I was suddenly tempted. When I nodded silently,
"Then, sir. If a lumpen like me goes to sell it, I'll surely be suspected. It's a bother, but sir, please go sell this at the watch shop just up from the underground passage. They should still be awake, and if it's a gentleman like you, they'll feel safe and turn it into cash right away..."
To the lumpen who said he would wait here, I entrusted my bag, took that watch, and hurried to the watch shop as instructed.
"I've lost my travel money and am in trouble; won't you buy this watch?"
When I said that, the watch shop old man gave a quick "yes" and said,
"Well then, let me take a good look,"
and began examining that watch under a bright desk lamp.
10,000 yen? 15,000 yen? My heart pounding, I waited for the old man's reply.

**The Bogus Boogie of the Pleasure Quarters**
**By Kotaro Kado**

**Episode 1: The Incredible Find**

Autumn nights stretch long, yet time has a way of slipping away when you're drinking.
"What? Eleven already? If I miss the last Hankyu train, I'm done for! Catch you later!"
I tossed a quick goodbye to my drinking buddies, tucked my briefcase under my arm, and bolted out of the bar. We were in the Sonezaki backstreets, so Umeda Station was just a stone's throw away. It was October, and the air had that signature damp, biting chill. I hurried down the stairs of the pedestrian underpass as usual, my footsteps echoing in the gloom, when a voice suddenly called out from behind.
"Excuse me, sir! A moment, if you please."
There wasn't another soul in sight, so he had to be talking to me. It wasn't likely to be a mugging, but I stopped, keeping my guard up.
"Begging your pardon, sir, but would this happen to be your watch?"
The man who approached me was a filthy-looking fellow—a "lumpen," as they say. He held out a round, flat object wrapped in a handkerchief. I happened to be carrying my late father's pocket watch, so I instinctively patted my vest pocket. To my relief, I felt the steady *tick-tock* of my own timepiece.
"No, it's not mine. But thanks anyway."
"Is that so? Well, it’s a beauty, isn't it? Look here, sir—this case is solid gold, I'm sure of it. Whoever dropped it must be sick over it. It’s worth a fortune."
The man’s wide-eyed admiration piqued my curiosity, and I leaned in for a look. Even under the dim lights of the underpass, the thing gave off a rich, golden glint.
"Sir, just between us... what do you reckon a thing like this is worth?"
"Well," I said, "if that's solid gold, it’s easily worth ten thousand yen."
"Ten thousand?! You don't say. Seems a bit of a waste to hand it over to the cops just for a measly few hundred yen reward..."
He shot a furtive glance around the tunnel, then leaned in and whispered.
"Look, sir. No one knows about this but you and me. What if we sell it and split the take? Five thousand apiece. What do you say? Hehehe."
Normally, I wouldn’t dream of pocketing found property, but the alcohol had clouded my judgment. I felt a sudden, greedy impulse and nodded.
"That’s the spirit. Now, if a vagrant like me tries to hawk this, they’ll call the police for sure. I hate to trouble you, sir, but there’s a watch shop just up the stairs from this tunnel. They should still be open. If a fine gentleman like yourself walks in, they won't suspect a thing and'll give you cash on the spot."
He offered to wait there and hold my briefcase. I handed it over, took the watch, and hurried toward the shop he’d pointed out. 
"I've lost my travel funds and I'm in a bit of a bind," I told the shopkeeper. "Would you be interested in buying this watch?"
"Certainly," the old man replied instantly. "Let's have a look."
He placed the watch under the glare of a desk lamp and began his inspection.
Ten thousand? Maybe fifteen? My heart hammered against my ribs as I waited for him to name his price.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** This is a standard magazine page from the mid-20th century. It uses vertical text (tategaki) read from top-to-bottom, right-to-left. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** 
    *   The title "**盛り場いんちきブギウギ**" (Pleasure Quarter Bogus Boogie-Woogie) is prominently displayed on the right in a bold, decorative font.
    *   The author's name "**門 好太郎**" (Kotaro Kado) follows.
    *   The chapter title is set in a smaller but clear typeface.
    *   A unique visual element is the handwritten-style graphic in the upper left: "**わて ほんまに、よいわんわ**" (I really can't say it), which uses a playful, cursive-leaning script. This serves as a "teaser" or a catchphrase associated with the series.
*   **Typography:** The main body text is a standard Mincho-style font common in printing of that era. Punctuation follows older conventions (e.g., using commas after question marks in some places).
*   **Lower Column:** The bottom of the page features a "footer" section separated by a horizontal line. This section contains shorter, more gossip-oriented or news-snippet style text, possibly satirical accounts of local corruption or social scandals.
*   **Pagination:** The number "(32)" is visible at the very bottom center, indicating the page number.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-War 1940s-50s):** The text mentions "Hankyu" (an Osaka-based railway), "Umeda," and "Sonezaki," placing the setting firmly in Osaka. The mention of "10,000 yen" for a watch and the term "Lumpen" (from the German *Lumpenproletariat*) are hallmarks of the post-war Japanese economic landscape.
*   **"Lumpen" (ルンペン):** In the 1940s and 50s, this was a common term for homeless individuals or the day-laborer class who lived in the ruins of bombed-out cities.
*   **The Scam:** The story describes a classic "drop-item" scam (*hiroimono-sagi*). The "found" watch is invariably a cheap brass fake. The scammer gains the victim's trust by offering a "split" of the profit and then holds the victim's valuables (the briefcase) or asks for "earnest money" before the victim realizes the watch is worthless.
*   **Boogie-Woogie:** Following the 1947 hit "Tokyo Boogie-Woogie" by Shizuko Kasagi, the word "Boogie-Woogie" became a buzzword for the frantic, often chaotic energy of post-war liberation and the black market culture.
*   **Political Context:** The footer mentions the "Socialist Party" (*Shakai-to*, here slightly modified as *Shayu-to*) and election violations, reflecting the turbulent political atmosphere and corruption scandals of the era.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **いんちき (Inchiki):** Fake, bogus, cheating, or shoddy.
*   **猫ババ (Nekobaba):** To pocket something found; to embezzle or keep a found item for oneself secretly.
*   **金側 (Kingawa):** Gold-cased (referring to a watch). 
*   **一瀉千里 (Isshasenri):** A four-character idiom (yojijukugo) meaning "with lightning speed" or "at a stretch," often used for a rapid decline or a forceful flow.
*   **左前 (Hidarimae):** To be in a bad financial state; for business to go downhill.
*   **玉のこし (Tama-no-koshi):** Marrying into wealth (lit. "a jeweled palanquin").

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Greed and Temptation:** The protagonist considers himself an upright citizen but is easily swayed by the prospect of "easy money" while under the influence of alcohol. This reflects a common moralizing theme in pulp fiction of the time.
*   **Post-War Chaos:** The setting—a dim underpass in a rebuilt city—and the presence of scammers and desperate people highlight the precarious social conditions of the Occupation era.
*   **Urban Sophistication vs. Street Smartness:** The protagonist sees himself as a "gentleman" (*shinshi*) compared to the "lumpen," yet he is the one being easily duped.
*   **Cynicism:** The title "Bogus Boogie-Woogie" and the satirical snippets at the bottom suggest a cynical, worldly-wise outlook on society, where everyone has a "racket."
