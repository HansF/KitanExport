　　　　（一）
　恵以子が第三の男と逢ったのは、鎌倉から帰って大分経った八月末のことである。
　男は二十七才。自称では画家と言っていたが、自己流に絵筆を持つだけの男。それでも『貴女をモデルに傑作を創り出したい』という絵描きの言葉は、女にとって正に殺し文句であった。男の画室は農家の納屋を改造した薄暗いがらんとした部屋だった。
「キミ、ボクのアトリエに来たら、ボクの言う通りにポーズとらなあかんで。ボクがよし云うまでそのままでおるんや。」そう云ってから男はにやと笑って、「キミも、ヒドク扱って貰う方がいいんと違うか」と云った。
　恵以子は両手首を頭上に括られて吊下げられた。男は恵以子の腰を抱くようにして抵抗を避けながら、洋装の彼女の上下半身を包んでいる下着を徐々に剥いで行った。スーツからスリップが長く露われて腿までを覆っていたが胡乱な風の触れるのは避けられなかった。男が離れると、恵以子の体は一本のロープにかかって手首や腕の附根が焼けるように痛んだ、その苦痛は、羞恥を意識しながらも頻りに足場を探って空を蹴らずにはいられぬ程だった。男は恵以子の背後に脚立を持ち出し、それに跨って片手で彼女の衣類の襟をぐいと纏めてつかむと、片手で手首の縄を器用にほどいた。二、三度激しくゆすぶられるとスーツもブラウスもスリップも今まで包んでいた女体を落して男の手に残った。パットを入れたブラジャーだけが残されていたが、それもすぐ男にむしるようにして取られた。
「やせとるなア、キミ、一体何食べとったんやね。年頃の女はどないにまずいもの食べたかて豚みたいによう肥えるもんやで。何でキミこないなんや。」
　男は恵以子の背に廻り、いきなりヒップをびしや／＼叩いて嘲笑した。男は細引で恵以子を後手に縛り首縄をかけて締上げた。画室には麻縄、棕梠縄、荒縄は勿論、芝居の太綱までが揃っていて、その上に恐ろしい責の大道具、小道具が金具を鈍く光らせ壁際に影を曳いていた。恵以子は初めて気付いた光景への恐怖と縛しめの苦痛に「うー、うー」と身を慄わせて低く呻いた。
“Life is short, art is long” 男は楽しそうだった。恵以子の前へ自作の責絵を並べた。
「どうや、これ。今日びは身体の美しいモデルが増えたそうやけど、ボクだけはモデル旱りや。ええ女やなア思うと思いッきりきついポーズにしてもうやろ、どないに我慢強いモデルかて泣いたり怒ったりや。二度と来いへん。

**Title:** "Seeking Suffering" (2)
**Subtitle:** —From the notes of a woman who longs for the rope—
**Author:** Kondō

(1)
It was late August, quite some time after returning from Kamakura, when Keiko met the third man.
The man was twenty-seven years old. He called himself a painter, but was just a man who held a brush in his own self-taught style. Even so, the painter's words, "I want to create a masterpiece with you as the model," were truly a "killing line" (seduction phrase) for the woman. The man's studio was a dimly lit, empty room that was a converted farmhouse shed.
"You, if you come to my atelier, you must strike the poses exactly as I say. You will stay that way until I say 'good'." After saying that, the man grinned and said, "Isn't it that you, too, would prefer to be treated terribly?"
Keiko had both wrists tied above her head and was suspended. Avoiding her resistance by holding Keiko's hips, the man gradually stripped away the underwear wrapping the upper and lower half of her Western-clothed body. The slip was revealed long from the suit, covering down to her thighs, but the touch of the suspicious draft (wind) was unavoidable. When the man stepped away, Keiko's body hung by a single rope, and her wrists and the roots of her arms hurt as if burning; the pain was such that, while conscious of her shame, she could not help but incessantly search for a foothold and kick at the empty air. The man brought a stepladder behind Keiko, straddled it, grabbed the collars of her clothes roughly in a bunch with one hand, and deftly untied the wrist rope with the other. After being shaken violently two or three times, the suit, blouse, and slip dropped from the female body they had been wrapping until now, remaining in the man's hands. Only the padded brassiere was left, but that too was immediately taken by the man as if plucking it off.
"You're thin, you. What on earth have you been eating? Girls of this age usually fatten up like pigs no matter how terrible the food they eat is. Why are you like this?"
The man went around to Keiko's back and suddenly slapped her hips *bisha-bisha* (smacking sound) and sneered. The man bound Keiko's hands behind her back with a thin cord and placed a neck-rope on her, tightening it. In the studio, hemp rope, palm-fiber rope, and rough rope were of course present, but even thick theatrical ropes were gathered there; furthermore, terrible large props and small props for torture dragged their shadows along the wall, their metal fittings shining dully. Keiko, in terror of the scene she had noticed for the first time and the pain of the binds, shivered her body and groaned low, "Oooh, oooh."
"Life is short, art is long." The man looked like he was having fun. He lined up his own torture paintings in front of Keiko.
"How is it, this? Nowadays, I hear there are more models with beautiful bodies, but I alone am in a model drought. If I think 'what a fine woman', I end up putting her in poses that are as tight/harsh as possible, you see; no matter how patient the model, she cries or gets angry. They never come a second time.

**In Search of Suffering** (Part 2)
*—From the memoirs of a woman longing for the rope—*
By Kondō

**(I)**
It was late August, some time after her return from Kamakura, when Keiko met the third man.

He was twenty-seven. He styled himself a painter, though he was merely an amateur wielding a brush in his own peculiar fashion. Nevertheless, the artist’s line—"I want to make you the model for my masterpiece"—proved to be the perfect seduction. His studio was a converted farmhouse shed, a dim and cavernous room.

"Listen. If you come to my atelier, you pose exactly as I tell you. And you stay that way until I say you’re done." He grinned lewdly. "Besides, you’d prefer to be treated cruelly, wouldn't you?"

Keiko was hoisted up, her wrists bound overhead. Holding her hips to stifle her resistance, the man began to peel away the layers of lingerie beneath her Western clothes. Her slip was revealed, extending long from beneath her suit to cover her thighs, but she could not escape the caress of the suspicious draft in the room. When the man stepped back, Keiko’s entire weight hung from a single rope; the roots of her arms and wrists burned with pain. Despite her shame, the agony forced her to kick blindly at the air, desperate for a foothold that wasn't there.

The man positioned a stepladder behind her and straddled it. With one hand, he roughly bunched the collars of her clothes; with the other, he deftly undid the rope at her wrists. He shook her violently two or three times, and her suit, blouse, and slip—which had clothed her body until a moment ago—fell away, leaving her naked skin exposed as the garments remained in his grasp. Only her padded bra remained, and he tore that away as if plucking feathers from a bird.

"You're skinny, aren't you? What have you been eating? Girls your age usually fatten up like pigs, even on slop. What’s wrong with you?"

He circled behind her, suddenly slapping her buttocks—*thwack, thwack*—and sneering. He bound Keiko’s hands behind her back with a thin cord and tightened a noose around her neck. The studio was stocked with hemp rope, palm-fiber rope, and straw rope, of course, but even thick theatrical hawsers lay in wait. Worse still, large and small torture implements lined the walls, their metal fittings gleaming dully in the shadows. Overwhelmed by the terror of this newly realized scene and the agony of her bonds, Keiko shivered and let out a low groan. *"Uuh... uuh..."*

"Life is short, art is long." The man seemed to be enjoying himself. He lined up his own "torture paintings" in front of her.

"What do you think of this? They say there are plenty of models with beautiful bodies these days, but I’m the only one in a drought. See, the moment I find a fine woman, I can't help but twist her into the harshest poses imaginable. No matter how patient the model, they end up weeping or flying into a rage. They never come back."

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Genre:** *Jitsawa* (True Story) / *Shuki* (Memoir) style fiction. This was a dominant format in *Kitan Club* and *Abnormal World*, where erotic fantasies were framed as reader submissions or confessions to add a layer of voyeuristic authenticity.
*   **Target Audience:** Men interested in SM, bondage (shibari), and domination scenarios. The text specifically caters to "rope longing" (*nawa e no dōkei*).
*   **Narrative Voice:** Third-person limited (focusing on Keiko), but heavily influenced by the male gaze of the antagonist. The tone shifts between clinical descriptions of clothing/binding and the character's internal sensory pain.
*   **Structure:** This is installment (2). The reference to "The third man" and "Kamakura" implies a serialized narrative where the protagonist moves from one abusive/dominant partner to another, fulfilling the title's promise of "Seeking Suffering."
*   **Editorial Layout:** The use of "Life is short, art is long" in English is a distinctive stylistic choice, likely intended to make the antagonist seem pretentious, intellectual, or nihilistic—a common trope for "evil artist" villains in ero-guro fiction.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **The "Atelier" Setting:** In postwar Japan (and prewar ero-guro), the painter's studio was a liminal space where social norms could be suspended. It provided a plausible excuse for nudity and bizarre posing under the guise of "Art."
*   **Western Clothing (*Yōsō*):** The text specifies "Western clothing" (suit, blouse, slip). By the 1950s, this was common, but the fetishistic focus on the *layers* (slip under suit, padded bra) reflects a specific fascination with modern female fashion and the act of dismantling it.
*   **Body Standards:** The antagonist insults Keiko for being thin ("Why aren't you fat like a pig?"). In the immediate postwar era (late 40s/early 50s), plumpness was often a sign of health and wealth. Being too thin could imply poverty or illness. However, in fetish literature, this verbal abuse serves to humiliate the subject.
*   **Rope Varieties:** The text lists specific types of rope:
    *   *Asanawa* (Hemp): Standard.
    *   *Shuro-nawa* (Palm fiber): Coarse, dark, very rough on skin.
    *   *Ara-nawa* (Rough straw): Very cheap, scratchy.
    *   This cataloging appeals to the *shibari* connoisseur reader.
*   **Kansai Dialect:** The antagonist speaks in a rough Kansai (likely Osaka) dialect (*akan, oru n ya, donai*). In Tokyo-centric media, this often coded a character as distinct from the polite norm—potentially aggressive, mercantile, or earthy/criminal.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Seme-e (責絵):** Lit. "Torture pictures" or "Blame pictures." A genre of ukiyo-e and later pulp illustration depicting bondage and torture.
*   **Koroshi-monku (殺し文句):** Lit. "Killing phrase." Means a pick-up line or a persuasive phrase that "seals the deal."
*   **Uron (胡乱):** Suspicious/Dubious. Used here to describe the "draft" (wind) touching her legs—an atmospheric way to describe feeling exposed and unsafe.
*   **Hosobiki (細引):** A thin but strong cord/rope.
*   **Kusareru (括られる):** To be tied up/bound.
*   **Patto (パット):** Pad/Padding (in the bra). Highlights the artificiality of the modern silhouette, which the man exposes.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Masochistic Epistemology:** The title "Seeking Suffering" implies the protagonist is not merely a victim but a participant on a quest for sensation. The text balances on the edge of non-consent and latent desire ("preferred to be treated terribly?").
*   **The Sadistic Artist:** The antagonist justifies his cruelty through Art. He claims "torture" is necessary to extract something from the model, a twisted take on the "suffering artist" trope.
*   **Objectification:** Keiko is literally turned into an object. She is "hoisted," her clothes are "peeled," and she is left "hanging by a single rope." The man's commentary on her weight treats her like livestock ("pig").
*   **Voyeurism:** The narrative slows down significantly during the undressing sequence, detailing every layer (suit -> slip -> bra), mimicking the reader's gaze.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Category:** Erotic Fiction / SM Literature.
*   **Sexual Content:** High. Bondage, forced stripping, nudity (implied/described), humiliation.
*   **Violence:** Moderate. Slapping (*bisha-bisha*), painful binding, suspension torture.
*   **Themes:** Non-consensual (or dubiously consensual) BDSM, humiliation, art fetish, rope fetish.
*   **Language:** Rough dialect, verbal abuse (body shaming).
