（ところで）
手だて、ケイベツに値ひする。
堂々と明るい所でヤリタマエ。エエですか。人数は２対２が最も容易とされている。
その場合、男は片方がギセイ的に三枚目を演じる必要がある。
何故二人連れの女子がよいかを、心理学的に分析すれば、女は總べてウヌボレと競争意識を強くおモチアソバシている。
「あの方が見ているのはあたしよ。えゝ、あたしですとも！」
と、兩方共カンガエル。
加えて、多少の冒険心に伴う危険を感じる裏に依頼心がヒソンデいるのだ。
「二人だから、めつたなことはないわ」
実際、もう一人ふえればカシマシイと古來定義されている女だから、二人でも十分氣丈夫に違いない。――でしょう。

北向きの季節風はひどい嵐とかわり、アカシヤの街路樹がヒステリーのように泣いていました。いつも来るワンタン売りも、今宵の嵐には辟易したと見え、寂しいチャルメラの音も聞えません。
オゝ、大事を決行するチャンスを天は興えたんです。此の機会を逃しては再び彼女の息の根を止める事が出来ません。
嵐はしきりに窓を打っています。夜は風と共に更けて行きます。私は凡ての用意を整えて例の秘密の通路を馬の胴腹にくっついたダニのように這いつくばり先づホテルの客室の上に来ました。

（ところで）
手段は、軽蔑に値する。
堂々と明るい所でやりたまえ。いいですか。人数は2対2が最も容易とされている。
その場合、男は片方が犠牲的に三枚目を演じる必要がある。
なぜ二人連れの女子がよいかを心理学的に分析すれば、女はすべて自惚れと競争意識を強くお持ちあそばしている。
「あの方が見ているのは私よ。ええ、私ですとも！」
と、両方とも考える。
加えて、多少の冒険心に伴う危険を感じる裏に依存心が潜んでいるのだ。
「二人だから、めったなことはないわ」
実際、「もう一人増えれば喧しい（かしましい）」と古来定義されている女だから、二人でも十分気丈夫に違いない。――でしょう。

六、場所（ところを選べ）
場所としては、寂しい暗いところは、必ず緊張しているから駄目である。明るい賑やかな、心のウキウキするような所を舞台とすべきである。

七、第一条件（ファーストインプレッション）

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Tactics for Acquiring a Love Interest]**
Tsumura

(By the way)
Means [of approach], are worthy of contempt.
Do [it] grandly in a bright place. Is that okay? As for numbers, 2-on-2 is said to be the easiest.
In that case, one man must sacrificially play the "third-rate" [comic relief] role.
If one psychologically analyzes why women in pairs are good, all women strongly possess vanity and a sense of competition.
"The person that gentleman is looking at is me. Yes, it's me!"
So, both of them think.
In addition, behind the danger accompanying a slight sense of adventure, a spirit of dependence is hidden.
"Because there are two of us, nothing unusual will happen."
Actually, because women are defined since ancient times as being "noisy if one more is added," even two must be sufficiently stout-hearted. --Right?

6. Place (Choose the place)
As for place, lonely dark places are no good because [she] is always tense. A bright, lively place where the heart goes "uki-uki" [excited] should be the stage.

7. First Condition (First Impression)
First, make [her] recognize [you]. Also, as favorably as possible. "Nishiki-fukusoku" [Splendid clothes but no substance?] is no good.

8. Sensation (Oh, what shall I do?)
Often without being conscious of it themselves, by the vibration of buses or trains, women are those whose sensations become very acute. Even if so, there are many cases where they do not notice it.
As for the appearance of the form, they align both legs neatly and stand on tiptoe. Then, they lose composure. Eyes take on a shine, and complexion becomes good. This is, in many cases, interpreted as "fatigue."

9. Love Ten Commandments (Must keep these in mind)
1. Do not wear disheveled clothing (Aloha shirts are a major taboo).
2. Do not be unclean (both body and heart).
3. Do not despise women (be a "lady first" advocate, okay).
4. Do not be obscene (attitude of course, and talk too).
5. Do not eat garlic (stinky thing).
6. Do not be below common sense (for example, memorize at least the movies opening that week).
7. Do not look at other women (jealousy is a woman's nature).
8. Do not tell lies (God dwells in an honest head).
9. Do not wear makeup (for a man, it’s strange).
10. Do not be eerie (resentful faces, funny faces, scary faces, etc., are troublesome).

10. Practical Section (Are there that many?)
1. On the sidewalk— When passing each other...

**[Fiction: Stormy Night]**
6. Stormy Night
The northerly seasonal wind changed into a terrible storm, and the acacia street trees were crying like hysterics. The usual wonton seller, appearing daunted by tonight's storm, his lonely charamela [horn] sound cannot be heard.
Oh, Heaven gave the chance to carry out the great deed. If I miss this opportunity, I cannot stop her breath again.
The storm repeatedly strikes the window. Night deepens with the wind. I prepared all arrangements and, like a tick stuck to a horse's belly, crawled through the usual secret passage and first came above the hotel guest room.
Looking through a knothole, a man in his forties specializing in smuggling appeared to have taken on malignant international syphilis; he was making a grimace and treating it.
To me, in this case, such things do not matter. Making a sound like a Japanese rat snake crawling on a ridgepole, while brushing away newly spun spider webs directly above her bedroom, I finally arrived.
Fortunately, her room is quite far from the drawing room, providing perfect conditions for murder.

7. Namiko's Last
She did not even dream that this fearsome hunchbacked intruder was lurking in the ceiling, and was sleeping soundly.
The storm grows worse...
Oh, from the second kiss to the third kiss, she who bravely threw everything—that worthless tower gate called virginity—into the melting pot of pleasure for the sake of her sailor lover, has become very adult-like these past two or three days, and her pelvis has developed to further stir a man's lust.
"Damn, she's even wearing a smile, she must be dreaming of that sailor. Just you wait..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Art of Winning a Lover**
By Tsumura

(A Word of Advice)
Sneaky tactics deserve nothing but contempt. Approach her boldly in the light of day. Are we clear? The easiest way is "two-on-two." In such a scenario, one man must gallantly play the foil—the comedic sidekick. Why are women in pairs preferable? Psychologically speaking, every woman harbors a deep-seated vanity and a competitive streak. Each thinks to herself, "He’s looking at *me*, of course!" Furthermore, behind the thrill of a minor adventure lies a hidden desire for safety. "I'm safe as long as I'm with a friend," she tells herself. Since the dawn of time, women have been described as "noisy in groups," so a pair provides just enough courage for her to be approachable. Don’t you agree?

**6. The Setting:** Avoid dark, lonely places; she’ll be too guarded. Choose a bright, bustling atmosphere that lifts the spirits.
**7. First Impressions:** You must make an impression, and a favorable one at that. No flashy, empty posturing.
**8. The Senses:** Often, without realizing it, a woman's physical sensitivity is heightened by the vibrations of a bus or train. You’ll see her press her legs together and stand on her toes, losing her cool. Her eyes sparkle, her cheeks flush—though most men mistake this for "tiredness."
**9. The Ten Commandments of Love:**
1. Dress sharp (No Aloha shirts!). 2. Stay clean in body and soul. 3. Respect women (Ladies first!). 4. Avoid obscenity in word or deed. 5. No garlic (it stinks). 6. Have some class (know what's playing at the cinema). 7. Don't ogle other women (jealousy is their nature). 8. Don't lie (honesty is divine). 9. No makeup (you're a man, for heaven's sake). 10. Don't look creepy (no scowling or weird faces).

**Practical Tips:** 1. On the sidewalk—when passing her...

**Short Story: A Night of Storms**
**VI. The Stormy Night**
The north wind had turned into a howling gale, and the acacia trees along the street wailed like hysterical spirits. Even the wonton peddler had retreated from the storm; the lonely cry of his horn was nowhere to be heard. Heaven had finally granted me the moment to strike. If I failed now, I would never have another chance to end her life. The wind lashed against the glass as the night deepened. I prepared my tools and crawled through the secret passage like a tick clinging to a horse’s belly, reaching the space above the hotel room. Through a hole in the wood, I saw a middle-aged smuggler grimacing as he treated a foul case of "international syphilis." I didn't care about him. Moving like a snake across the rafters, I brushed aside spiderwebs until I was directly above her bed. Her room was far from the others—perfect for murder.

**VII. Namiko’s End**
She slept soundly, never dreaming that a monstrous, hunchbacked intruder was lurking just above her head. The storm raged on. Ah, she had recently surrendered her "worthless" virtue to her sailor lover in a fit of passion; over the last few days, she had blossomed into a woman, her figure now a cruel provocation to a man's desire. "Damn her," I hissed. "She's smiling... dreaming of that sailor, no doubt. Just you wait..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This is a typical page from a mid-century Japanese "pulp" or *kasutori* magazine. These magazines were known for their cheap paper (which often smelled like the dregs of shochu, hence the name "kasutori") and their mix of practical advice, eroticism, and grotesque fiction (*ero-guro*).
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of Kyujitai (old-style kanji) and Katakana for emphasis and loanwords (like "First Impression"). The font is a standard Mincho style, but the layout is cramped, typical of high-density pulp printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "戀人獲得術" (Tactics for Acquiring a Lover) is bolded at the top right. The page uses horizontal dividers and numbering to break up sections. 
*   **Illustration:** A stylized, somewhat cartoonish illustration at the top shows abstract symbols (perhaps keys or pipes) and a small figure, adding a playful yet slightly mysterious tone. In the center, a more dramatic illustration shows a man looking through a ceiling hatch, setting the scene for the noir fiction below.
*   **Structure:** The page is structured to maximize content, fitting a "useful" column and a "thrilling" story onto one page (page 81).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-WWII):** The use of terms like "International Syphilis" and "Smuggler" (密輸専門) points to the chaotic black-market era of late 1940s/early 1950s Japan. The mention of "Aloha shirts" as a taboo reflects the influx of Western (specifically American) fashion and the conservative backlash against "frivolous" styles.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The "Love Tactics" section is overtly patriarchal and manipulative, reflecting the gender norms of the time. It views women as competitive with each other and susceptible to psychological "tricks."
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** The fiction at the bottom follows the "Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense" tradition popular in Japan. The protagonist is described as a "hunchback" (佝僂 - *sekuri/kumushi*, a common trope for "creepy" villains in old pulp) and the focus on the woman's "developed pelvis" is a clear appeal to the male gaze of the era's readership.
*   **The Wonton Seller:** The mention of the "Charamela" (the horn blown by ramen/wonton sellers) is a classic trope to establish a lonely, urban midnight atmosphere in Showa-era literature.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **三枚目 (San-maime):** A theatrical term from Kabuki referring to the comic role. In dating, it means playing the "funny guy" to make the friend feel comfortable.
*   **カシマシイ (Kashimashii):** Written with three "woman" characters (姦しい), it means noisy or boisterous. The text references the ancient joke that three women together are "noisy."
*   **ウキ＼／ (Uki-uki):** An onomatopoeia for being cheerful or excited.
*   **ニシシキフソク (Nishiki-fukusoku):** Likely a typo or archaic slang for *Nishiki-no-mihata* (gilded banners/empty prestige) or *Nishiki-ni-fuku-nashi* (wearing fine clothes but having no luck/substance).
*   **国際梅毒 (Kokusai Baidoku):** "International Syphilis." This likely refers to a particularly virulent strain of the disease thought to be brought in by sailors or foreign soldiers during the occupation.
*   **青大将 (Aodaisho):** The Japanese rat snake. Used here as a simile for the creeping, silent movement of the intruder.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Predatory Nature:** Both sections view the relationship between men and women as a hunt. The top section treats romance as a "tactic" or "acquisition," while the bottom section literalizes the hunt as a murder plot.
*   **Urban Decay:** The mention of smugglers, disease, and secret passages in hotels reflects the gritty reality of post-war Japanese cities.
*   **Misogyny:** Women are depicted either as vain, competitive creatures to be manipulated (in the advice column) or as sexual objects whose "pelvic development" is a focal point even in a murder scene (in the fiction).
*   **The "Mask" of Civilization:** The advice column suggests "acting" a certain way to win a woman, implying that social interactions are a series of performances and deceptions.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Magazine Page, Advice Column, Pulp Fiction (Ero-Guro).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Romance, Crime, Post-war Japan, Misogyny, Social Etiquette, Noir, Sensationalism.
*   **Classification:** Kasutori Magazine (Pulp).
