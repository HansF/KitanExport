```
This image contains two distinct sections of text from a Japanese publication, likely an "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) or "pulp" magazine from the early post-war period (late 1940s to 1950s). The top half provides "instructional" advice on how to pick up women in public spaces, while the bottom half is a gruesome piece of fiction titled "Eating Female Flesh."

**[ナンパの心得]**
うっかり見つめ合う。これで、矢庭に追跡するような軽挙は控えた方がいい、次の機会を待つ。もう一度逢った時、つんとされたら止めた方がよろしい。
　微笑をしたら、もはやしめたもの。見てくれただけでも脈はある。三度出逢えば申し分ないが、そのへんは要領よく考えて、さも自然らしく挨拶するか、後を追う。
　これは追い越し、追い越され、更に追い越し、更に追い越されながら「意識の流れ」を測量しつつ順次接近する。相手がもし暗い横町などへ折れば、既に好機である。
　この場合、最も難しいことは、他人に気付かれないでやることだ。
「お嬢さん」
「何ですの」
相手はきっと白々しくとぼける。
「一緒に散歩して下さいませんか？」
「だって、あたし、あなたを存じ上げないんですもん」
「だって、始めは知らないもんですよ。でも、もう……」

②喫茶店の類（たぐい）で――
　偶然そこで発見したのでも、「これだ」と目指して後から従ったのでもよい。席は真正面か、前斜め、じっと凝視。相手もこちらを見たら、先に視線をそらす。
「気の弱い方！」
と、もしそうでなくても、ほのかな優越を感じる。そこに「隙」ができる。
　注文するものは、女と同じものにすると効果がある。特にそれが、オレンジエードとか、グレープジュースとか、割に高いものだと、更によい。そんな時、
「あら、真似してるわ」
相手が笑ったら、目で挨拶をする。で、女が立ったら、同時に席を離れる。レジスターでかち合ったら、ちょっと退いて、女を先にする。そして、外へ出たら……

③映画劇場のよう（な）ところで――
　いともおぞましき（？）恋愛映画の濃厚なのが終わった後などが、ふさわしい。
「天然色映画はいいわね」

「六神丸売りの婆さんから買った毒の吹き矢は、私の口から放たれて、小気味よく彼女の心臓に突き刺さったではないですか。
『おお、彼女は昇天した、勝利だ、アハハ』
　見たまえ、彼女は苦悶し始めました。両の腕で空の半月を抱くような格好をしたかと思うと、私にとっては最も鬼門の二つの足を宙に躍らせ、何か叫んだまま息絶えたようです。」

　ああ、彼女はこの佝僂（せむし）の手に依って倒れました。さて、どうして死体の始末をしたらよいか。私はスルスルと屋根裏から下りて、彼女の重い死体を再び屋根裏へ担ぎ上げたんです。
　豊麗な若い肉体はすっかり私に預けられて、その重量に小さな私は幾度つまずき、よろけたでしょう。
　やがて彼女の屍（しかばね）をズルズル引きずり、私の部屋まで持って来ると、静かに寝台の上に寝かせました。なんだか死んでいるとは思われず、細い寝息を立てているようです。
　私は「ひかり」（タバコ）を一服吸った後、いよいよ死体の始末に取りかかりました。最後の接吻を屍に与えると、黙祷したのち、バラバラに手足を、心臓を小さな瓶に密封しました。
　彼女のあの伸びやかな若い牝鹿（めじか）のような身体は、余すところなく、この醜いセムシの腹の中に尊い宝物のように隠されたのです。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Seduction Tips]**
Carelessly eyes meet. With this, suddenly to follow-like reckless-act had better refrain, next opportunity wait. Once more when met, if treated coldly, stopping is better.
If (she) smiles, already caught-thing. Only looking-at (me), there is a pulse. Meeting three times is ideal, but that part intelligently think, and as if naturally greet, or follow behind.
This is passing, being passed, further passing, further being passed while "stream of consciousness" measuring, gradually approach. If partner into dark alleyway etc. turns, already good.
In this case, most difficult thing is, by others not being noticed, doing it.
"Young lady." "What is it?" Partner surely blank-expression gives.
"Together stroll please won't you?" "But, I, you don't know-thing (particle)." "But, beginning is not knowing-thing. But, already..."

8. Woman-Flesh Eating
Rokushin-gan seller old woman from bought poison blow-dart from my mouth released, satisfyingly her heart in stuck wasn't it. "Oh, she ascended, victory ahahaha."
Look, she agony began. Both arms with sky's half-moon embracing-like pose did think, for me most demon-gate two legs in mid-air danced something shouting while breath-ended it seems.
Ah, she by this hunchback's hand fell. Now, how corpse disposal should do? I smoothly from attic descended her heavy corpse again to attic carried up.
Voluptuous young body completely to me was entrusted and its weight by small me many times stumbled tottered probably.
Soon her corpse dragging to my room bringing when quietly bed top on laid. Somehow dead not thought thin sleep-breath making seems.
I "Hikari" (cigarette) one puff smoked after, finally corpse disposal began. Last kiss to corpse giving then silent prayer did after, into pieces hands-feet, heart small bottle in sealed.
Her that supple young doe-like body without leaving anything, this ugly hunchback's belly inside precious treasure-like was hidden.
Her fat father surely...

**[Pick-up Tactics]**
You happen to lock eyes. At this point, you should refrain from the reckless act of immediately tailing her; instead, wait for the next opportunity. If she gives you the cold shoulder the next time you meet, it’s best to give up.
If she smiles, you’ve already won half the battle. Just the fact that she looked at you means there’s a spark. Meeting three times is ideal, but you must use your wits—either greet her as if by chance or follow her. 
The trick is to pass her, let her pass you, and pass her again, gauging the "stream of consciousness" as you gradually close the distance. If she turns down a dark alleyway, it’s the perfect chance.
The most difficult part is doing this without being noticed by others. 
"Excuse me, miss." "Yes?" She will almost certainly feign ignorance.
"Would you care to go for a stroll with me?" "But I don't even know you." "Well, everyone is a stranger at first. But now..."

**[Short Story]**
8. Consuming Female Flesh
The poisoned blow-dart I bought from the old woman who sells Rokushin-gan flew from my lips and struck her squarely in the heart. 
"Oh, she has ascended! Victory! Ahahaha!"
Look at her—she began to writhe in agony. Just as I thought she looked like she was reaching out to embrace the half-moon in the sky, she thrust her legs—those two limbs that were my ultimate nemesis—into the air, and with a final cry, she drew her last breath.

Ah, she fell by the hands of this hunchback. Now, how to dispose of the body? I slid down from the attic and carried her heavy corpse back up into my lair.
Her voluptuous young body was now entirely mine; I, small as I am, stumbled and tottered many times under her weight.
Before long, I dragged her corpse into my room and laid her gently on the bed. She didn't look dead at all; it was as if she were still breathing softly in her sleep.
After taking a puff of a Hikari cigarette, I finally set to work on the remains. Giving the corpse a final kiss and offering a silent prayer, I dismembered her—limbs and heart—and sealed them in small jars.
That supple, young, doe-like body was tucked away, every inch of it, inside this ugly hunchback’s belly like a precious treasure.
Her fat father would never suspect...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into two distinct horizontal zones. The top half is a "how-to" guide for approaching women, while the bottom half is a shocking fictional story.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of Kanji and Hiragana, with significant use of Katakana for emphasis, foreign loanwords (like "Technicolor"), and certain adjectives/verbs—a common stylistic choice in mid-century Japanese magazines.
*   **Visual Elements:** Two line-art illustrations accompany the text. One shows a man and a woman in a stylized, romanticized encounter (relating to the top text), while the other shows a woman in a state of distress or collapse (relating to the "Eating Female Flesh" story).
*   **Structure:** The top section is organized with numbered headings (②, ③) indicating different "stages" or "scenarios" for the seduction guide. The bottom section uses a numbered chapter title ("八" / 8).
*   **Page Number:** The number "-82-" is visible at the bottom right.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** This is likely from a *Kasutori* magazine—low-quality pulp magazines that flourished in Japan shortly after WWII (late 1940s to early 1950s). They were known for a mix of "3 S's": Screen (movies), Sport, and Sex.
*   **Ero-Guro Nonsense:** The bottom story is a classic example of "Erotic Grotesque Nonsense," a literary and artistic movement that focused on the bizarre, the perverse, and the shocking.
*   **Technicolor (天然色/テクニカルカラー):** The mention of "Natural Color" and "Technicolor" films points to the post-war era when color cinema was a new and exciting luxury in Japan.
*   **Hikari (ひかり):** A popular brand of cigarettes in the early Showa era.
*   **Rokushin-gan (六神丸):** A traditional Chinese/Japanese medicine (herbal pills) often sold by itinerant peddlers. Using an "old woman selling Rokushin-gan" as a source for poison is a common trope in detective/mystery pulps.
*   **Social Conventions:** The seduction guide reflects a time when "strolling" (散歩) was a common euphemism for a date, and the "pick-up" culture was heavily influenced by Western cinema.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ヤニワ (Yaniwa):** Archaic/Dialectal for "suddenly" or "on the spot" (矢庭に).
*   **シメタモノ (Shimeta-mono):** Derived from *shimeru* (to tighten/close). Used idiomatically to mean "I've got it!" or "Success!"
*   **意識の流れ (Ishiki no nagare):** "Stream of consciousness." While usually a literary term, here it likely refers to gauging the "vibe" or mental state of the woman being followed.
*   **ヨキ (Yoki):** An archaic/poetic way of saying "good" (良き).
*   **白ばつくれる (Shirabakkureru):** To feign ignorance or act as if one knows nothing.
*   **佝僂 / セムシ (Kuru / Semushi):** Archaic terms for a hunchback (kyphosis). "Semushi" is now considered a highly offensive/discriminatory term in modern Japanese.
*   **鬼門 (Kimon):** Literally "Demon Gate" (the unlucky Northeast direction in geomancy). Metaphorically used to mean a weakness, a nemesis, or something one cannot overcome.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Misogyny and Objectification:** Both texts treat women as objects to be "hunted" (the guide) or "consumed" (the story). There is a heavy focus on the "voluptuousness" and "doe-like" quality of the female body.
*   **The "Outcast" Protagonist:** In the fiction piece, the narrator is a "hunchback" who feels inferior (referring to the woman's legs as his "nemesis"). His act of murder and cannibalism is framed as a "victory" over his physical deformity and social status.
*   **Escapism:** These magazines provided a dark, sensationalist escape for men in the grueling years following Japan's defeat in WWII.
*   **Contrast of Mundane and Macabre:** Placing a "how-to" guide for a movie theater date next to a story about dismembering and eating a woman highlights the jarring, "nonsense" editorial style of these pulp publications.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Pulp Fiction, Advice Column, Ero-guro.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Seduction, Murder, Cannibalism, Disability, Cinema, Post-war Japan, Misogyny, Horror.
*   **Classification:** Mature/Explicit (themes of violence and non-consensual behavior).
