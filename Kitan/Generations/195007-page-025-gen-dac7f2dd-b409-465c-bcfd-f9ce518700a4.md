ニューギニア島の西方に、ちょうど日本の四国ぐらいな大きさの島で、セラム島というのがある。その一部落で「男の阿部定事件」というのが起こった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**South-Seas Trouble Picture-Scroll**

**The God of Amorous Affairs**

**From "Ala Manis"**

**Kadoya Shizufumi**

**1**

To the west of New Guinea island, in an island just about the size of Japan's Shikoku, there is one called Ceram Island. In one village there, a "Male Abe Sada Incident" occurred.
It was around two o'clock in the middle of the night.
From the house of a man named Abdullah, suddenly, the sound of throwing objects and the "dotan-batan" sound of violent struggling occurred. Consequently, in the next house, an Arab man named Ahama woke up.
"Tch, they've started it again."
Opening his sleepy eyes halfway, as if it were a bother, while saying so, he looked at the face of his wife lying beside him.
The bright moonlight peculiar to the South Seas leaked through gaps in the wall woven with coconut leaf stems, illuminating the wife's beautiful sleeping face palely.
Having held the wedding ceremony just about three months ago, the fresh wife, her 18-year-old tense body beside her husband's—who was 15 years different in age—rugged black legs, was making peaceful sleeping breaths as if completely at ease.
Because she was a woman Ahama had hand-picked, the Arab-specific long-slit eyes like a Greek goddess, long eyelashes, wonderfully well-formed high nose, and rich cheeks—all these were exceedingly soft, radiating a womanly sexiness.
As Ahama opened his eyes wide as if for the first time and stared entranced at his wife's sleeping face, the commotion next door suddenly became quiet. Ahama knitted his brows slightly and strained his ears. Usually, it would continue longer, and after that, there would always be sounds of giggling or kisses, but tonight something is strange. Not even a "kotori" (clink) sound is made.
When Ahama raised his upper body and brought his ear to the wall, his wife woke up and,
"What's the matter?"
she said in a sugary voice, wriggling her naked body, and like her husband, placed her ear against the wall.
"I can't hear anything, can I?"
Saying so, as if perhaps having a lewd recollection, she stared at her husband with feverish eyes and smiled.
"No, you were sleeping without knowing, but they were making a racket just now. It suddenly went 'pitat' silent—somehow the situation is strange."
"It's fine, isn't it, such a thing?"

**The South Seas Scandal Chronicles**

**The Deity of Desire**

**From the collection "Ala Manis"**

**By Shizufumi Kadoya**

**I**

West of New Guinea lies an island roughly the size of Shikoku called Ceram. It was in a village there that a local version of the "Abe Sada Incident"—this time involving a man—took place.
It was around two in the morning.
The sudden sound of objects being hurled and the heavy thuds of a violent struggle erupted from the home of a man named Abdullah. In the house next door, an Arab man named Ahama was jolted awake.
"Tch, they're at it again," he muttered.
He pried his heavy lids halfway open with an air of annoyance and glanced at his wife lying beside him.
The brilliant moonlight, so characteristic of the South, filtered through the gaps in the walls woven from palm fronds, casting a pale glow over her beautiful, sleeping features. They had been married only three months. His bride, just eighteen and full of youth, lay there breathing softly and contentedly beside her husband—a man fifteen years her senior with rugged, dark-toned legs.
She was a woman Ahama had chosen with the utmost care. She possessed the long, almond eyes of a Greek goddess, long lashes, a perfectly sculpted high nose, and full cheeks—all of which combined to radiate a soft, feminine allure.
As Ahama stared at her, mesmerized as if seeing her for the first time, the ruckus next door abruptly ceased. He knit his brows and listened intently. Usually, the fighting lasted much longer, followed inevitably by the sounds of muffled giggles and kisses. Tonight, however, felt different. There wasn't even the faintest rustle.
Ahama sat up and pressed his ear to the wall. His wife woke.
"What is it?" she asked, her voice thick with sleep and sweetness. She shifted her naked body and joined him, pressing her own ear against the wall.
"I don't hear a thing," she whispered.
She looked at him with a sultry smile and a suggestive glint in her eyes, as if lost in some naughty memory of her own.
"No, you were asleep," Ahama replied. "There was a terrible row just a moment ago. Then it just stopped, dead silent. Something isn't right."
"Oh, never mind them," she teased.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography:** The page features a classic vertical Japanese layout. The main title "色ごとの神さま" (The God of Amorous Affairs) is hand-lettered in a bold, stylized, and slightly playful display font, typical of the "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines of the post-war era.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the series ("南方いざこざ絵巻") is placed at the top right, followed by the specific story title in the largest font. The author's name is placed beneath the title.
*   **Illustrations:** The top and bottom left feature line-art illustrations of palm trees and tropical huts, establishing the exotic "South Seas" setting immediately. The illustrator is credited simply as "Reiko."
*   **Column Structure:** The text is divided into thin vertical columns, a standard formatting choice for periodicals to make the dense text easier to scan.
*   **Punctuation:** The text uses Japanese-style tildes (〜) to indicate prolonged sounds or a "bubbly" tone (e.g., ホヤ〜, ごり〜, 惚れ〜), which was common in popular fiction of that period to convey a lighter or more sensual mood.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** This text likely dates to the late 1940s or early 1950s. During this time, "Nanpō-mono" (South Seas stories) were popular. This fascination stemmed from Japan's wartime occupation of Southeast Asia; many veterans returned with stories, and the public maintained a lingering exoticized interest in the region.
*   **The Abe Sada Incident (阿部定事件):** Mentioned in the first paragraph, this refers to a famous 1936 crime where a woman named Abe Sada strangled her lover and severed his genitals. By calling the events on Ceram Island a "Male Abe Sada Incident," the author is signaling to the reader that a grizzly, sexually-charged crime (likely involving genital mutilation) has occurred.
*   **Geographic Setting:** Ceram Island (Seram) is a real island in Indonesia. The mention of it being "about the size of Shikoku" helps Japanese readers visualize the scale. The "Arab man" (Ahama/Ahmad) reflects the historical presence of the Hadrami Arab diaspora in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia).
*   **"Ala Manis" (アラ、マニス):** "Manis" means "sweet" in Malay/Indonesian. "Ala Manis" is a well-known folk song/phrase from the Moluccas region. Its use here adds local color and suggests a romantic or sensual theme.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **いざこざ (Izakoza):** Trouble, feud, or bickering. Often implies a messy or petty dispute.
*   **色ごと (Irogoto):** A love affair, a scandal, or matters relating to romance and sex. It often has a slightly "pulp" or salacious connotation in this context.
*   **阿部定事件 (Abe Sada Jiken):** A cultural shorthand for a crime of passion involving sexual mutilation.
*   **ニュウギニヤ (Nyūginiya):** An older phonetic spelling of New Guinea (modern: ニューギニア).
*   **ホヤ〜 (Hoya-):** Derived from "hoya-hoya," meaning brand new or "piping hot." Used here to describe a "newlywed" wife.
*   **蒼白く (Aojiroku):** Palely. Often used in a literary sense to describe skin illuminated by moonlight or the paleness of a corpse/ghost.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Exoticism and Eroticism:** The text heavily emphasizes the "otherness" of the setting (palm trees, moonlight, Greek goddess comparisons for an Arab woman) to create a sensuous, escapist atmosphere for the Japanese reader.
*   **Domestic Contrast:** The author contrasts the violent, mysterious noise of the neighbors (Abdullah) with the quiet, domestic, and highly sexualized intimacy of the protagonists (Ahama and his young wife).
*   **The Male Gaze:** The description of the wife focuses entirely on her physical attributes (lashes, nose, cheeks, "naked body") and her "sweet" or "feverish" behavior, catering to a male-dominated readership.
*   **Suspense:** The sudden transition from noise to silence is a classic narrative hook, using the characters' eavesdropping to pull the reader into the mystery.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Fiction (Kasutori).
*   **Genre:** Mystery, Nanpō-mono (South Seas fiction), Ero-guro (erotic-grotesque - implied).
