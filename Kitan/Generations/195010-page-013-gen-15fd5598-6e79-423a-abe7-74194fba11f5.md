## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Must Not Laugh**

...Thinking of such a loathsome disease name in his head, he was feeling depressed.
Then his wife said,
"Dear, there is a strange thing."
For about two months this month, she hasn't seen the "red thing" in the detached toilet; the condition of her body is also strange... so she says.
Again the wet nurse is dragged out. And, that wet nurse's reply was unexpected.
This spring, when visiting the Oinari-sama shrine, under the first torii gate, she met a world-beatingly beautiful page (koshō), and that page appearing in her dreams at night, every night, every night... and, she became this kind of body, she says.
So weeping and weeping, the young lady confessed, it is said.
"Hm, I see."
Mozaemon, that night, thrust a short sword into his belt and hid under the veranda of the detached room.
At the hour of the ox (dead of night), a pure white thing jumped over the fence.
It was a white fox. Standing before the rain shutters, it tapped twice, "ton ton," then the door opened naturally, and by the wind entering from the gap, the light went out with a "fuh," and before long, the sound of the daughter moaning in her sleep began to be heard.
"Wait, monster!"
When he called out waiting for it to come out,
"Kon kon (barking)," it said.
"Coming to this point, 'kon kon' is no use (pun on 'none'). Well, please come back here. Let us have you become my daughter's husband."
O-ito-san crawled into the futon and was turning bright red in the total darkness.

**○Strange Medicine**
Nurse: "Doctor, it's terrible. This patient won't wake up no matter how many injections I give."
Doctor: "It can't be helped. It's the last resort. Show him the bill."

**○Counterfeit Bills**
Policeman: "Why did you stop being blind? A blind man would get more [alms], wouldn't he?"
Beggar: "Because lately counterfeit bills are circulating."

**○Long Time Waiting**
She: "Hey, you. At least when you have a rendezvous with me, you should shave your chin (bone) clean."
He: "No, actually I shaved before leaving, but... [it grew back because I waited so long]."

**○Love Control**
"Um, truly sorry, but could you please turn off the electric light in the front room?"
"Oh, has the blackout control (blackout) started again?"
"No, actually, the silhouettes of the two of you are reflected on the paper screen..."

**○Letter of Introduction**
Wife: "You! Please wake up. Something is rattling at the entrance. Hey, wake up quickly, it's surely a thief."
Husband: "Mmm, no, it's a rat, it's definitely a rat."
Wife: "Oh, you're scared, aren't you? Surely that's it, I'm sure of it. Coward!"
Husband: "D-don't be stupid! If it's a thief, I've made it a rule never to meet anyone without a letter of introduction. I... you know that too, don't you?"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Don't You Dare Laugh**

Haunted by the name of some loathsome disease, he sat there moping.
His wife spoke up: "Dear, something strange is happening."
She explained that for about two months now, their daughter hadn't seen her "monthly visitor" in the outhouse, and her physical condition seemed... off.
The wet nurse was summoned once more, and her report was quite a shock.
Apparently, while visiting the Oinari Shrine this spring, the daughter had encountered an exquisitely beautiful young page under the first torii gate. Since then, he had appeared in her dreams night after night... until her body ended up in this state. This was the confession the young lady had made through her tears.
"I see," Mozaemon muttered.
That night, he tucked a short sword into his belt and lay in wait beneath the floorboards of the detached room.
In the dead of night, a snow-white figure leaped over the garden wall. It was a white fox. It stood before the shutters and tapped twice—*tap, tap*. The door slid open of its own accord, a gust of wind blew out the lamp, and soon the sound of the girl’s distressed moaning filled the air.
"Halt, monster!" Mozaemon cried, intercepting it as it tried to flee.
"Kon, kon!" the fox barked.
"It’s a bit late for 'kon-kon' excuses! You might as well come back inside. We'll have you as our son-in-law!"
Inside, O-ito-san burrowed deep into her quilts, her face turning crimson in the pitch black.

**Strange Little Tales**
**by Furyu Taro**

**A Miracle Cure**
Nurse: "Doctor, it’s an emergency! No matter how many stimulants I inject, this patient won't regain consciousness!"
Doctor: "There's nothing for it. Use the nuclear option: show him the hospital bill."

**Fake Money**
Policeman: "Why’d you stop pretending to be blind? Surely a blind beggar pulls in more coins."
Beggar: "Not these days, officer. There are too many counterfeit bills going around."

**The Long Wait**
She: "Really, dear. When we have a 'rendezvous,' the least you could do is shave your face clean."
He: "I did shave before I left home, honestly... [but I've been waiting here for so long it grew back!]"

**Romance Under Control**
Neighbor: "Excuse me, I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind turning off the light in your front room?"
Woman: "Oh dear, has the wartime blackout started again?"
Neighbor: "No, it's just that... your silhouettes are being projected quite clearly onto the paper screens."

**The Letter of Introduction**
Wife: "Wake up! Someone's rattling around at the front door. Get up, it's definitely a burglar!"
Husband: "Mmm... no, it's just a rat. Definitely a rat."
Wife: "Oh, you're just terrified, aren't you? I knew it! You're a total coward!"
Husband: "D-don't be ridiculous! I have a strict policy: I never meet anyone—burglars included—unless they have a formal letter of introduction. You know that's how I roll!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout**: The page follows a classic "variety page" layout common in Japanese pulp magazines (*kasutori* magazines). It is densely packed with text-based entertainment and visual puzzles.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**:
    *   The main title **"笑つてはいかん"** (Don't Laugh) is large, stylized, and set in a decorative border at the top left, signaling the humorous intent of the section.
    *   The **"奇譚小話"** (Strange Tales) section uses bold bullet points (circles) to separate individual jokes.
    *   The **Shogi diagrams** (Figure 2 and 3) are clearly boxed to the right, serving as a mental challenge for the reader.
    *   The **Comic (Manga)** at the bottom left provides a visual anchor and a final lighthearted punchline.
*   **Typography**: The text uses traditional vertical layout (*tate-gaki*). It utilizes older orthography (e.g., small 'tsu' is the same size as regular characters, use of *hentaigana* style or older kanji forms like 醫 for 医).
*   **Columns**: The page is divided into two main horizontal tiers, with the top tier containing the primary story and the bottom containing shorter jokes, Shogi, and the manga.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s/Early 1950s)**: The reference to "灯火管制" (Blackout Control) is a direct nod to WWII-era Japan, but here it is used as a joke, suggesting a transition period where the war is a fresh, often bitter, but joke-able memory.
*   **Kasutori Culture**: Post-war Japan saw the rise of cheap, "kasutori" (dregs) magazines—low-quality pulp fiction that focused on gossip, eroticism, and humor to provide an escape for a weary population.
*   **The Fox Wedding (Kitsune no Yomeiri)**: The top story plays on Japanese folklore regarding foxes (*kitsune*) possessing or seducing humans. The "loathsome disease" implied is pregnancy, which the father humorously resolves by demanding the fox marry into the family.
*   **Strip Shows (ストリップ・ショウ)**: These became extremely popular in the late 1940s in Japan (notably the *Teigeki* and *Shinjuku* theaters). The manga at the bottom mocks the "dazzling" effect of returning to reality (the sun) after being in a dark, illicit theater.
*   **Social Manners**: The "Introduction Letter" joke mocks the rigid formality of Japanese social hierarchy, where one technically shouldn't interact with a stranger without a proper third-party introduction—a rule the husband uses as a comical excuse for his cowardice.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **離れ (Hanare)**: A detached room or building, common in traditional wealthy Japanese homes for guests or unmarried daughters.
*   **丑満刻 (Ushimitsudoki)**: The "hour of the ox," specifically between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM, traditionally considered the time when the veil between the human and spirit worlds is thinnest.
*   **脇差 (Wakizashi)**: A short sword worn by samurai. Its mention suggests a period setting (Edo era) for the first story.
*   **ランデブー (Randebū)**: "Rendezvous." Loanwords from French/English were becoming fashionable "modern" terms for dates in this era.
*   **お骨 (Okotsu)**: Literally "bones," but used colloquially here to refer to the jawline or chin area.
*   **灯火管制 (Touka Kansei)**: Wartime blackout regulations where citizens had to cover windows to prevent Allied bombers from seeing city lights.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Subversive Humor**: The jokes often punch "sideways"—mocking the medical system (the bill waking the patient), the poverty of beggars (fake money), and the absurdity of social etiquette.
*   **Sexual Innuendo**: The "red thing" (menstruation) and the pregnancy by a "fox" are thinly veiled references to illicit affairs or premarital sex, common themes in adult humor magazines of the time.
*   **Gender Dynamics**: The "Cowardly Husband" and "Nagging Wife" are archetypal figures used to provide relatable, safe comedy.
*   **Juxtaposition of Tradition and Modernity**: The page moves from a traditional ghost story (fox possession) to modern "Strip Shows" and hospital bills, reflecting the chaotic mix of old and new in post-war Japan.
