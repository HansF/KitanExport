**桃色・セクション**

**オフィス戀慕調**
**忘れたハンド・バッグ**
**此花 大助**

榮商會の事務所で、一人居残つて仕事をしていた崎山君は、實に思いがけなくも、大變な發見をした。
トイレツトの棚の上に、無造作に置き忘れられたハンド・バッグ、崎山君は、ハテ誰のだろうと何気なく手に上つて、そのまま保管しておくとりだつたが、ふと好奇心を起して、中に入つているものを調べて見たくなつた。それがイケナカツタ。
中から出て来たものは、コンパクト、櫻紙、爪切り、小さな櫛、現金百八十四圓也入りの財布、それらは何の變哲もなかつたが、たつた一つ、不可解至極のものが現れた。
外でもない。ハート型の中に美人の繪を画いた包紙に包まれた指でさわつてみると、まわりが寸高くなつたヤツである。
げに合點のゆかぬ代物であるいや、品物はそれ程むづかしいものではない。馬鹿や聖人でない限り、當今の男性ならば、よしんばそれは類稀なる石部金吉でも、風の便りに聞き及んでい。たアレである。
誰にも分る代物なのだが、分らないのは、ハンド・バッグは言うまでもなく婦人の持ち物である。今崎山君の發見したものは女性に必要のないものである。何のために、こんなものがこんなところに入つているのか、分りきつたものも、その有り場所によつて、極めて不可解になる。さすがの崎山君も、ハテナ？と首を捻つた。
中に入つていた名刺によればこれは女事務員の須藤有磨子嬢の持ち物である。須藤嬢は社内でも、噂に高い美貌の持ち主、獨身の崎山君もひそかにその影を慕つている一人だ。
何か一思案した後、ニヤリと笑つて、自分の名刺を一校その中に入れてパチリと閉め元の場所へ置いた。
何くわぬ顔をして崎山君が再び仕事をしていろ所へ上つて來たのが須藤嬢だつた。
「オヤ、須藤さん」
「えゝーす、忘れものをしましたものですから」
「あゝ、そうですか」
と、え知らぬ顔をした崎山君肚の中では十分彼女の狼狽を予期していた。
果して、ハンド・バッグを収つてトイレツトから出て來た彼女通りすがリざま、崎山君を見て躊躇したが、何と思つたか、つと側へ寄つて來た。
「大變、御精が出ますこと」
「崎山君、オヤさい思いながら、えゝ是非今日中に片づけおかなきやならないことがあつてね」
「まだ中々お済みになりませんか？」
「いや、もう十分もすれば済むんです」
「では お待ちしていますから御一緒に、お茶でも召上りませんか？」
「結構ですねー」
ーで、しばらく沈默が續いたが、やがて須藤嬢、ピタリと寄り添つて
「木下さん」
と呼びかけた。
「あなた、あたしのハンド・バッグの中をごらんになりましたわね」
「えゝ」
と崎山君、顔を擧げて
「何気なく、拝見しました」
「あんまり何気なくもございませんわ。で、どうお考えになりました？」
「何が？」
「何がつてあのの中にありましたもの」
「いや、なか〜御盛んで結構だと思いましたよ」
「まぁ！」
須藤嬢ことゝで改つて
「崎山さん、お願いございますわ、どうぞどなたにも秘密に遊ばして。」
「えゝ、勿論」
「まぁ、それで安心致しましたわ。どうぞ是非ね」
そこで崎山君きつぱりとして
「但し、條件付きですよ」
と言つた須藤嬢ぎくりとして
「條件とおっしゃいますさ？」
崎山君、立ち上つて、彼女の手を執つた。
「つまりその、ハンド・バッグの中のものを使用する光榮を、僕に奥えて戴きたいのです」
「あら！」
と須藤嬢、飛びしきつて、
「あなたは卑怯な方ね」
「卑怯でも何でも構わんのです。おイヤならどうぞお構いなく」
「……」
須藤嬢はしばらく默つていたが、やがて蚊の泣くような聲で言つた。
「仕方ありませんわ、では一度だけ、ね」

栄商会の事務所で、一人居残って仕事をしていた崎山君は、実に思いがけなくも、大変な発見をした。
トイレの棚の上に、無造作に置き忘れられたハンドバッグ。崎山君は、はて誰のだろうと何気なく手に取って、そのまま保管しておくつもりだったが、ふと好奇心を起こして、中に入っているものを調べてみたくなった。それがイケなかった。
中から出てきたものは、コンパクト、桜紙（ティッシュ）、爪切り、小さな櫛、現金百八十四円也入りの財布。それらは何の変哲もなかったが、たった一つ、不可解至極なものが現れた。
外でもない。ハート型の中に美人の絵を描いた包み紙に包まれた、指で触ってみると、周りが一段高くなったやつである。
実に合点のゆかぬ代物である。いや、品物はそれほど難しいものではない。馬鹿や聖人でない限り、今日の男性ならば、よしんばそれが類稀なる石部金吉（堅物）でも、風の便りに聞き及んでいるあのアレである。
誰にも分かる代物なのだが、分からないのは、ハンドバッグは言うまでもなく婦人の持ち物であることだ。今、崎山君が発見したものは女性に必要のないものである。何のために、こんなものがこんなところに入っているのか。分かりきったものでも、その在り場所によって、極めて不可解になる。さすがの崎山君も「はてな？」と首を捻った。
中に入っていた名刺によれば、これは女事務員の須藤有磨子嬢の持ち物である。須藤嬢は社内でも噂に高い美貌の持ち主。独身の崎山君も密かにその影を慕っている一人だ。
何か一思案した後、ニヤリと笑って、自分の名刺を一枚その中に入れてパチリと閉め、元の場所へ置いた。
何食わぬ顔をして崎山君が再び仕事をしている所へやって来たのが須藤嬢だった。
「おや、須藤さん」
「ええ……。忘れ物をしてしまいましたものですから」
「ああ、そうですか」
と、素知らぬ顔をした崎山君。腹の中では十分彼女の狼狽を予期していた。
果たして、ハンドバッグを取ってトイレから出てきた彼女は、通りすがりざま、崎山君を見て躊躇したが、何と思ったか、つと側へ寄って来た。
「大変、お精が出ますこと」
「崎山君、おやすい御用と思いながら、ええ、是非今日中に片付けておかなきゃならないことがあってね」
「まだ中々お済みになりませんか？」
「いや、もう十分もすれば済むんです」
「では、お待ちしていますから、ご一緒に、お茶でも召し上がりませんか？」
「結構ですね」
――で、しばらく沈黙が続いたが、やがて須藤嬢、ピタリと寄り添って
「崎山さん」※
と呼びかけた。
「あなた、あたしのハンドバッグの中をご覧になりましたわね」
「ええ」
と崎山君、顔を上げて
「何気なく、拝見しました」
「あんまり何気なくもございませんわ。で、どうお考えになりました？」
「何が？」
「何がって、あの中に入っていたもの」
「いや、中々お盛んで結構だと思いましたよ」
「まぁ！」
須藤嬢、ここで改めて
「崎山さん、お願いがございますわ。どうぞ、どなたにも秘密に遊ばして（内緒にして）」
「ええ、もちろん」
「まぁ、それで安心いたしましたわ。どうぞ是非ね」
そこで崎山君、きっぱりとして
「ただし、条件付きですよ」
と言った。須藤嬢はぎくりとして
「条件とおっしゃいますと？」
崎山君は立ち上がって、彼女の手を取った。
「つまり、そのハンドバッグの中のものを使用する光栄を、僕に与えていただきたいのです」

*(Note: In the original text, she calls him "Kinoshita-san" once in the dialogue column, but he is referred to as "Sakiyama-kun" everywhere else. This is likely a printing typo for "Sakiyama-san".)*

**Office Love-Longing Style**
**The Forgotten Handbag**
**By Konohana Daisuke**

In the office of Sakae Trading Company, Sakiyama-kun, who was staying behind alone and doing work, truly unexpectedly, a great discovery made.
On top of the shelf of the toilet, carelessly left behind handbag. Sakiyama-kun, "Hmm, whose is it?" casually took in hand, and as it was, intended to keep it safe, but suddenly curiosity arose, and what was inside he became wanting to investigate. That was the bad thing.
Things that came out from inside were: a compact, tissue paper, nail clippers, a small comb, a wallet containing 184 yen cash. Those were nothing unusual, but just one, an extremely mysterious thing appeared.
It was nothing else. Inside a heart-shaped wrapping paper with a beautiful woman's picture drawn, wrapped, when touched with a finger, the around-part was one-step-high thing.
Truly, it is a thing that does not make sense. No, the item itself is not that difficult a thing. As long as not a fool or a saint, if a modern male, even if he is a rare "Ishibe Kinkichi" (stiff/moralist), it is "that thing" he has heard of through rumors.
It is a thing anyone understands, but what is not understood is, a handbag is, needless to say, a woman's possession. That which Sakiyama-kun discovered now is a thing unnecessary for a woman. For what purpose is such a thing in such a place? Even a thing well-understood, depending on its location, becomes extremely mysterious. Even the Sakiyama-kun, "Huh?" and tilted his head.
According to the business card that was inside, this is the possession of the female clerk, Miss Yumako Suzufuji. Miss Suzufuji is even within the company a person of rumored high beauty. The single Sakiyama-kun is also one who secretly longs for her shadow.
After thinking for a moment, with a smirk, he put one of his own business cards inside, clicked it shut, and placed it back in the original location.
Acting as if nothing happened, while Sakiyama-kun was working again, the one who came up was Miss Suzufuji.
"Oh, Miss Suzufuji."
"Yes... I did a forgotten thing, so..."
"Ah, is that so?"
Sakiyama-kun, who acted as if he didn't know. In his belly, he was fully expecting her panic.
As expected, taking the handbag and coming out from the toilet, as she passed by, she looked at Sakiyama-kun and hesitated, but thinking something, she came straight to his side.
"My, you are working very hard."
"Miss Suzufuji—well, I thought it would be easy, but yes, there's something I must finish today."
"Is it not finishing yet?"
"No, if it's ten more minutes, it will be finished."
"Then, I will be waiting, so together, shall we have some tea?"
"That would be wonderful."
—And so, for a while silence continued, but soon Miss Suzufuji, pressed close to him...
"Sakiyama-san."
...she called out.
"You, you looked inside my handbag, didn't you?"
"Yes," Sakiyama-kun said, raising his face. "Casually, I had a look."
"It wasn't very casual, was it? So, what did you think?"
"About what?"
"I mean, about the thing that was inside that."
"Well, I thought you were quite 'active' (lusty), and that's fine."
"My!"
Miss Suzufuji, here becoming formal:
"Sakiyama-san, I have a request. Please, keep this a secret from everyone."
"Yes, of course."
"My, I am relieved by that. Please, definitely."
There, Sakiyama-kun, becoming decisive:
"However, it is with conditions."
He said. Miss Suzufuji, startled:
"Conditions, you say?"
Sakiyama-kun stood up and took her hand.
"In other words, the honor of using the thing inside that handbag, I want you to grant it to me."
"Oh!"
Miss Suzufuji, jumping back:
"You are a cowardly (mean) person."
"I don't care if I'm cowardly or anything. If you dislike it, please don't mind me (it's off)."
"..."
Miss Suzufuji was silent for a while, but soon in a voice like a mosquito's cry, she said:
"It can't be helped... then, just once, okay?"

**Office Romance: The Forgotten Handbag**
**By Konohana Daisuke**

Sakiyama was working late and alone at the Sakae Trading Company office when he made a most unexpected and startling discovery. 
He spotted a handbag left carelessly on a shelf in the restroom. At first, he simply picked it up, wondering whose it might be, intending to keep it safe. But a sudden spark of curiosity got the better of him, and he decided to peek inside. That was his first mistake.

Inside, he found the usual items: a powder compact, some tissues, nail clippers, a small comb, and a wallet containing 184 yen. There was nothing out of the ordinary—except for one thing. It was utterly baffling. 
Wrapped in a heart-patterned paper featuring a beautiful woman’s face was an object that, when touched, felt raised around the edges. 
It was a nonsensical thing for a woman to carry. Or rather, the item itself wasn’t mysterious; any man of the modern age, unless he was a complete fool or a saintly monk, would recognize it instantly from rumors, even if he were a notorious prude. 

What Sakiyama couldn’t fathom was why such an item—strictly for male use—would be in a lady’s handbag. A familiar object becomes a complete enigma depending on where you find it. Sakiyama scratched his head in confusion.
A business card inside revealed the owner: Miss Yumako Suzufuji, the office clerk renowned for her beauty. Sakiyama, a bachelor, was one of many who secretly admired her from afar.
After a moment’s thought, he smirked. He slipped one of his own business cards into the bag, snapped it shut, and returned it to the shelf.

A few moments later, Miss Suzufuji appeared while Sakiyama was pretending to be engrossed in his work.
"Oh, Miss Suzufuji."
"Yes... I realize I’ve left something behind."
"Ah, I see," Sakiyama replied, feigning ignorance while secretly anticipating her panic.

Having retrieved her bag from the restroom, she hesitated as she passed his desk, then decided to approach him.
"My, you’re working quite late."
"Yes, I thought I’d be done sooner, but there’s some work I absolutely must finish today."
"Will you be much longer?"
"No, I should be done in about ten minutes."
"In 그 case, I’ll wait for you. Shall we go for tea together?"
"That sounds lovely."

A silence hung between them for a while as they walked, until Miss Suzufuji leaned in close and whispered.
"Mr. Sakiyama... you looked inside my bag, didn't you?"
Sakiyama looked up. "I did have a casual look, yes."
"It wasn't exactly 'casual,' was it? So... what did you think?"
"About what?"
"About... what was inside."
"Well," he replied, "I thought you seemed quite adventurous. I think it’s great."
"Goodness!" 
She turned serious. "Mr. Sakiyama, I have a favor to ask. Please, don't tell a soul about this."
"Of course not."
"Oh, what a relief. Please, you must promise."
Then, Sakiyama took a firm tone. "On one condition."
She gasped. "A condition?"
Sakiyama stood up and took her hand. "I want the honor of being the one to use that item you have in your bag."
"Oh!" She jumped back. "You’re a despicable man!"
"Despicable or not, I don't care. If you don't like the idea, then forget I said anything."
"..."
Miss Suzufuji fell silent for a long moment. Finally, in a voice no louder than a mosquito's hum, she spoke.
"I suppose I have no choice... just this once, then."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of *Kyujitai* (pre-war kanji) and *Shinjitai* (modern kanji), typical of the transition period in the late 1940s. The title uses the archaic character for love (戀).
*   **Layout:** The page is structured in vertical columns, common for Japanese magazines. The header "桃色・セクション" (Pink Section) is enclosed in a decorative border with heart/lip icons, signaling adult or romantic content.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is large and bold, followed by the subtitle and author. The illustration is placed at the bottom, breaking up the text.
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing of a stylish woman of the era (likely Yumako) looking in a hand mirror and applying lipstick. This reinforces the "modern girl" (Moga) influence that persisted into the post-war era.
*   **Page Number:** "-73-" at the bottom suggests this is a mid-magazine feature.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Publication Era (Late 1940s - early 1950s):** This story belongs to the "Kasutori" magazine subculture. These were cheap, pulp magazines that flourished during the occupation of Japan. They often featured "ero-guro-nansensu" (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) or light, suggestive "pink" stories.
*   **The "Item" in the Bag:** While never explicitly named (a common rhetorical device in such stories), the text heavily implies a **condom**. The description—wrapped in paper with a woman's face, "raised around the edges" when felt through paper—matches the packaging of the era. The shock comes from the fact that a "virtuous" office lady is carrying a male contraceptive, implying she is sexually active or "modern."
*   **Office Culture:** The setting reflects the early days of the "OL" (Office Lady) culture, where men and women worked together, but social hierarchies and reputations were strictly guarded. 
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** The name "Kasutori" comes from a cheap dreg-liquor; it was said these magazines lasted only three issues (the amount of drinks it takes to get drunk on the liquor).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **戀慕 (Renbo):** An old-fashioned, romantic word for love or longing.
*   **石部金吉 (Ishibe Kinkichi):** A four-character idiom (yojijukugo) used to describe a stubborn, overly serious, or straight-laced person—a "square."
*   **狼狽 (Robai):** Confusion, panic, or being flustered.
*   **御盛ん (Osakan):** Literally "prosperous" or "thriving," but in this context, it is a euphemism for being sexually active or "frisky."
*   **蚊の泣くような聲 (Ka no naku yōna koe):** A "voice like a mosquito's cry"—an idiom for a very faint, thin, or barely audible voice, often used to show bashfulness or submission.
*   **櫻紙 (Sakuragami):** An old term for soft tissue paper or toilet paper.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Voyeurism and Privacy:** The story begins with a violation of privacy. The male protagonist's curiosity is rewarded with leverage over the female protagonist.
*   **Sexual Liberation vs. Reputation:** The drama hinges on the contrast between Miss Suzufuji's public image (a beautiful, respected clerk) and her private life (implied by the "item").
*   **Blackmail as Romance:** The ending is problematic by modern standards. Sakiyama uses his discovery to coerce her into a sexual encounter ("the honor of using the item"). This was a common trope in the pulp fiction of that era, where "bargaining" for sex was framed as a cheeky romantic conquest.
*   **The "Modern Girl":** The story plays on the post-war anxiety and fascination with "liberated" women who might be carrying their own birth control.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Short Fiction, Pulp Fiction, "Pink" Story.
*   **Tags:** Office Romance, Post-war Japan, Euphemism, Social Manners, Coercion, Kasutori Culture.
