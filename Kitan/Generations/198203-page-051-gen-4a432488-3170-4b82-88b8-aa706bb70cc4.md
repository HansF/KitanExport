## 3️⃣ Literal English Translation

Even for a woman who has experienced [other] men, her way of thinking is that she feels the man she had sex with holds a weakness [over her]. Taking this in reverse [taking advantage of this], one executes SM play semi-forcibly.
If, at that time, the woman becomes rebellious, that is proof that she was not satisfied by the sex. If she has been satisfied by sex, a woman will listen to almost anything.
In a woman's head, the thing called logic does not exist. All that exists are lust and greed. If one does not understand this fact, one will end up kneading strange logic to justify SM play and try to make the woman cooperate, but as I stated before, such logic does not work on women.
She does it because the man she likes says "Let's do this and that"; if you knead strange logic there, it will only invite the woman's suspicion.
SM play is still seen as perversion, and no matter how much one tries to justify it, in the end, it is futile.

Women are trapped by sexual morals far older than men think, and this is the same even for the young women of today who are called free and uninhibited. Even for a woman who is liberated regarding sex, SM play is different. Do not believe the nonsense articles in weekly magazines and the like.
It is SM play that risks [you] being called a pervert if you mistake the method of inducement, but if you incorporate this right in the middle of sex, the unnaturalness fades compared to cases without sex.
To impatiently pull out a rope from the beginning cannot be called a very good plan. Rather, in the beginning, one ascertains the partner's reaction through psychological SM play.
For example, while joined in the rear-entry position, twist the woman's both hands up to her back. While holding the woman's both hands down just like that, deepen the union further in the same state as if she were bound behind her back with a rope.
For the woman, it is a state just as if she is being raped, but if she reaches climax just like that, it can be said she has sufficient aptitude as a masochist.

## 4️⃣ Literary English Translation

Even a woman with prior experience tends to feel that a man she has slept with holds a certain leverage over her. A man should turn this to his advantage and execute SM play semi-coercively.

If she resists at that moment, it is proof she was not satisfied by the sex. A woman satisfied sexually will accede to almost anything.

Logic does not exist within a woman’s mind. There is only lust and desire. If a man fails to understand this, he will attempt to invent strange rationales to justify SM play to gain her cooperation. However, as I have stated before, such logic has no currency with women. She participates simply because the man she fancies says, "Let's do this or that." To introduce complex reasoning is merely to invite her suspicion. SM play is still viewed as perversion; attempting to intellectually justify it is ultimately futile.

Women remain bound by sexual morals far more archaic than men realize. This holds true even for the young women of today, ostensibly known for their "free and uninhibited" nature. Even a woman sexually liberated in other respects views SM play as something distinct. Do not trust the reckless articles found in the weekly tabloids.

While SM play carries the risk of being branded a pervert if the introduction is mishandled, incorporating it during the act of intercourse makes it feel far less unnatural than attempting it cold.

It is poor strategy to impatiently produce a rope right at the start. Rather, one should first gauge the partner's reaction through psychological SM play.

For instance, while joined in the rear-entry position, twist her arms up behind her back. Pinning her hands there—mimicking the state of being bound by rope—deepen the penetration.

For the woman, this simulates a state of being raped. If she is able to reach climax in this condition, one can say she possesses sufficient aptitude as a masochist.

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** Editorial / Instructional Essay (likely from a column on "SM Technique" or "Sexual Psychology").
*   **Narrative Voice:** Authoritative, clinical, and misogynistic. The writer adopts the persona of a veteran or "Sensei" guiding the male reader through the complexities of seduction and dominance.
*   **Target Audience:** Adult men, specifically those interested in expanding their sexual repertoire into BDSM but fearful of social stigma or rejection.
*   **Magazine Positioning:** The high page number (51) and dense text suggest this is a feature article (reading material) rather than a purely visual pictorial. The juxtaposition of text and a relevant illustrative photo (shibari) reinforces the "educational" framing of the erotica.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Gender Essentialism:** The text reflects the rigid gender norms of Showa Japan. The assertion that "logic does not exist" (*rikutsu... sonzai shinai*) in women's minds is a standard trope of the era's pulp literature, characterizing women as purely emotional/carnal beings to be managed by male intellect.
*   **The "Weekly Magazine" (*Shūkan-shi*) Boom:** The text disparages "weekly magazines." This dates the text to the post-1956/1959 era, when mainstream weekly tabloids (*Shukan Shincho*, *Shukan Bunshun*) exploded in popularity. Pulp magazines like *Kitan Club* often positioned themselves as the "authentic" underground alternative to the "nonsense" found in mainstream tabloids.
*   **"Free and Uninhibited" (*Jiyū Honpō*):** This references the changing sexual mores of the late 50s/60s (the "Sun Tribe" or *Taiyōzoku* generation), acknowledging that young women were becoming sexually active but arguing they still held conservative views on fetishism.
*   **Rape Fantasy (*Gōkan*):** The text explicitly encourages roleplaying non-consent. In the context of *Kitan Club*, fantasies of helplessness were a primary genre convention, often serving as a safe outlet for exploring power dynamics in a rigid society.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Rikutsu (理屈):** Logic/Reasoning. Here used with a negative nuance, implying quibbling, excuse-making, or cold rationality that kills the mood.
*   **Iro to Yoku (色と欲):** Lit. "Color (Eros) and Greed." A phrase with Buddhist roots reducing human motivation to carnal desire and worldly gain.
*   **Kore-kore (コレコレ):** "This and that." A placeholder for specific sexual acts or requests, implying they need not be spoken aloud or justified.
*   **Haikō-i (背向位):** "Back-facing position." A somewhat clinical/formal term for rear-entry or doggy style.
*   **Jakumi (弱味):** Weakness/Vulnerability. In this context, it implies the social shame or emotional attachment a woman feels after having sex, which the author frames as leverage.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Dominance via Psychology:** The text argues that physical bondage (ropes) is secondary to psychological bondage (leverage, shame, authority).
*   **Gatekeeping:** The author draws a line between "mainstream" sex (which may be liberated) and "SM" (which remains taboo/perverse), framing the latter as a higher tier of intimacy that requires careful calibration.
*   **The "Teacher" Archetype:** The writer positions himself as a cynical sage who sees through the "facade" of modern women to their "true" primitive nature.
*   **Coercion as Foreplay:** The text blurs the line between consent and coercion, suggesting that "semi-forced" action is actually what women desire deep down (a common, albeit problematic, trope in this literature).

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Type:** Text (Essay/Instructional) + Image (Photo).
*   **Sexual Content:** Explicit descriptions of sexual positions (rear entry), BDSM (binding, twisting arms).
*   **Themes:** Masochism, Dominance, Rape Fantasy (*Gōkan*), Misogyny, Psychological Manipulation.
*   **Intensity:** Medium-High (Text is explicit about manipulation; Image is standard bondage erotica for the era).
