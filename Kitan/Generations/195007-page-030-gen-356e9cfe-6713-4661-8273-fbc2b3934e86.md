きやした。で、いつものように思う存
分なことをと思つても、もう、ちつと
も楽しくも面白くもありません。
で、あつしや、ふと思いついたんで
す、これを切りとつてしまや、もうい
ろ〜することあたねえ、これがあるば
つかしに、どれだけ苦しんだか、そう
思つてつく〜見ると、髭を生やして
にやりと笑つて、やがるような気がし
て、もうあつしや、カーッとのぼせ
あがると、傍にあるナイフをとりあげ
ていたんです。そしてどういう風に切
りとつやろうと考えたが、どうも切
りようがないんでさあ、そこでハタと
困つたんですーー」
　アハマとイマムはもうすつかり話に
魅せられて、はて、自分なら、どうい
う具合に切りとるだろうと、色々想像
をたくましゆうしながら、食い入るよ
うにアブドラの顔をみつめている。
「すると、娘が正気に返えりやして、
ふとあつしが持つているナイフに気が
ついて、キャッーと悲鳴を上げたんで
す、で、あつしや夢中で、颯とナイフ
を斬りおろしてしまつたんです」
　　　　トワン・ドクトル

「ふーむ――」
　アハマとイマムは、やつと我れに返
つたように顔をゆるめた。
　やがて、沈黙を破つて、イマムがお
むろに言つた。
「アブドラ、女を切りや、一番困るの
は、いつたい誰だと思う、お前なん
だぞ」
「御尤もで――」
　アハマがくすりと笑つて、イマムに
「しかし、その男つてのはどんな奴な
んだろう」
と言つて、腕を組んで考え込んだ。
すると、イマムが立上つて
「おい、アブドラちょっとそのコップ
というのを見せてくれ」
といった。
　アブドラは直ちに立上つて隣室へ行
くと、小さな陶器製の古ぼけたコップ
を持つてきて
「これでございます」
とイマムに差し出した。
「ふーむ、これはお前、どこで手に入
れた」
「道端で拾つたんでさあ、もう十年も
前ですかな？」
「ふーむ」
　イマムは、不思議そうに裏をみた
り、撫でてみたり、匂いをかいだりし
ていたが
「おい、こりゃ、俺も見たことがない
珍しいものだ、ひよつとすると――神
様の仕業かも知れないぞ」
「へぇ？――」
　アハマとアブドラが驚いて眼を剥い
た。
「きつとそう違いない、普通の人間な
らそんな器用な真似
は出来やしない、それ
はな、アブドラ、お前
の嫉妬深いのを神様が
お試しになつたんだと
俺は思う、このコップ
はきつと、昔々の大昔
アラ・マニス（色事の
神様）に捧げたコップ
に違いない」
　そう言つてイマムが
うや〜しく掌に汚な
らしいコップを載せて
ムニャ〜と祈りを上
げた。
　アブドラとアハマも
祈りの言葉をとなえた
やがてイマムが言つ
た。
「いまこそ謎がとけ
たぞ、アブドラ、つま
り、お前がいない間、
このコップがお前の身
代りをつとめたんだ、
だからお前が留守にす
ると水がこぼれたんだ
女房がいつたらうあなたの留守中だつ
てこぼしますとな」
　そういつてまたイマムが高らかに祈
りを上げた。アブドラとアハマも。あ
まりの有難さに立上つて、聲を合わせ
て祈り上げた。
　その後、イマムは、そのコップを祭
壇にまつり、嫉妬深い男や女に対して
祈つてやると、まことにレイケンあら
たかで、みな心を柔らげられ、喜んで
帰つていつた。で、この部落は、それ
から、ずーつと、嫉妬に狂つて斬つた
はつたの事件を起こすような者はひと
りもなくなった。おかげで、どんな男
が夜這いにこようと女房を寝とろう
と、文句を言うような男はひとりもな
くなり、有難いことには、どれが誰の
女房やら亭主やら、さつぱり見当もつ
かなくなつてしまつた。

「ごもっともで――」

「いまこそ謎が解けたぞ、アブドラ、つまり、お前がいない間、このコップがお前の身代わりを務めたんだ、だからお前が留守にすると水がこぼれたんだ。女房が言ったろう、あなたの留守中だってこぼしますとな」
　そう言ってまたイマムが高らかに祈りを上げた。アブドラとアハマも。あまりの有り難さに立ち上がって、声を合わせて祈り上げた。
　その後、イマムは、そのコップを祭壇に祭り、嫉妬深い男や女に対して祈ってやると、まことに霊験（れいけん）あらたかで、みな心を和らげられ、喜んで帰っていった。で、この部落は、それから、ずっと、嫉妬に狂って斬ったはったの事件を起こすような者は一人もなくなった。おかげで、どんな男が夜這いに来ようと女房を寝取ろうと、文句を言うような男は一人もなくなり、有り難いことには、どれが誰の女房やら亭主やら、さっぱり見当もつかなくなってしまった。

Came. And, as always thinking-at-will things doing though, already, at all fun also interesting also there is not.
And, I (asshu), suddenly thought of it, if this cut off, already various things to do there isn't, because of this existence only, how much suffered, so thinking closely looking, beard growing grinning laughing, seems like is doing feeling, already I, kaaa-head heated up, nearby being knife took up was. And in what way cut off would do thought, but really way to cut is not, there "hata" troubled I was---"
Ahama and Imam already completely in story fascinated being, well, if self, in what manner cut off would, various imagination making-active while, as if eating-in Abdura's face staring.
"Then, girl to sanity returned, suddenly I holding knife noticed, 'Kyaaa' scream raised. And, I in-trance, 'sa' knife slashed down finished."
        Tuan Doktor

"Hmm---"
Ahama and Imam, finally to self returned like faces loosened.
Before long, silence breaking, Imam slowly said.
"Abdura, woman cut-if, most troubled person, who think, you it is."
"Most reasonable---"
Ahama "kusuri" laughed, to Imam
"But, that man what kind of guy is he I wonder"
saying, arms crossed thought deeply.
Then, Imam stood up
"Hey, Abdura a little that cup called thing show me"
said.
Abdura immediately stood up next room went, small ceramic-made old cup bringing
"This it is"
to Imam offered.
"Hmm, this you, where hand-in entered (obtained)."
"Roadside-at picked up, already ten years before is it?"
"Hmm"
Imam, strangely back looked, stroked, smell smelled doing was but
"Hey, this, I also seen thing-not rare thing it is, by chance---God's work might be."
"Hee?---"
Ahama and Abdura surprised eyes peeled.
"Surely so no-mistake, ordinary human if such skillful imitation (feat) can't do, that is, Abdura, your jealousy-deepness God tested I think, this cup surely, long long ago Ara Manis (Love-affairs' God) to offered cup no-mistake."
So saying Imam respectfully palm-on dirty-looking cup placed "munya-munya" prayer raised.
Abdura and Ahama also prayer words recited.
Before long Imam said.
"Now mystery solved, Abdura, in other words, you not-being while, this cup your substitute served, therefore you absent being-when water spilled. Wife said right, your absence-during even spills."
So saying again Imam loudly prayer raised. Abdura and Ahama also. Too much gratefulness-to stood up, voices together prayed up.
Thereafter, Imam, that cup altar-on enshrined, jealous men and women towards prayed for, truly divine-efficacy fresh-and-clear, everyone hearts softened, happily went home. And, this village, from then, forever, jealousy-in-crazy slashing-stabbing incidents causing people one-person-also became-not. Thanks to, whatever man night-visiting comes or wife sleeps-with-take, complaint saying man one-person-also became-not, gratefully, which who's wife or husband, at all clue-attach became-not.
                  --End--

"...I was at my wits' end. I tried to enjoy myself as usual, but there was no pleasure or interest in it anymore. Then, a thought struck me: if I just cut this thing off, my troubles would be over. The more I looked at it, the more I felt it was mocking me with a bearded grin. My blood boiled. I snatched up a knife. I debated how to carve it away, but I couldn't find a way to start. I was completely stuck."

Ahama and the Imam were utterly spellbound, imagining how they themselves might have performed such a surgery as they stared intensely at Abdura's face.

"Suddenly," Abdura continued, "the girl came to her senses. She saw the knife in my hand and let out a blood-curdling scream. In a blind frenzy, I brought the blade down."
        —Tuan Doktor

"Hmm..."
Ahama and the Imam finally snapped out of their trance, their tense expressions relaxing. Breaking the silence, the Imam spoke gravely.
"Abdura, if you go around cutting up women, the one who ends up in the most trouble is you."
"You are quite right..."
Ahama chuckled and said to the Imam, "But I wonder, what kind of man was he, really?" He crossed his arms and fell into deep thought.
Suddenly, the Imam stood up. "Hey, Abdura, show me that 'cup' you mentioned."

Abdura stood up immediately and went into the next room. He returned with a small, weathered ceramic cup. "Here it is," he said, handing it to the Imam.
"Hmm. Where did you get this?"
"I found it by the side of the road, oh, maybe ten years ago?"
"Hmm..."
The Imam inspected it curiously, turning it over, stroking it, and even sniffing it. "Listen, I've never seen anything quite like this. It's rare. This might just be... the work of God."
"What?" Ahama and Abdura's eyes widened in shock.

"It must be. No ordinary human could produce such a thing. I believe God was testing the depths of your jealousy, Abdura. This cup surely must be an ancient relic dedicated to Ara Manis, the God of Love Affairs."
With that, the Imam reverently placed the grubby cup on his palm and began mumbling a prayer. Abdura and Ahama joined in the chanting.
Finally, the Imam spoke. "The mystery is solved! Abdura, this cup acted as your substitute while you were away. That is why it leaked water when you were gone—just as your wife said, it spilled because you weren't there to hold it!"

The Imam raised his voice in a grand final prayer. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Abdura and Ahama stood and prayed along in unison.
From that day on, the Imam enshrined the cup on an altar. He would pray over it for jealous husbands and wives, and the divine results were remarkable. Everyone’s hearts were softened, and they went home happy. In that village, no one ever again fell into a jealous rage or caused a bloody scene. Thanks to the cup, it didn't matter if men came for secret night visits or stole each other's wives; not a single man complained. In fact, it became such a blessing that eventually, no one had the slightest idea who was married to whom.
        —THE END—

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout**: The text is arranged in vertical columns (tategaki), typical of Japanese publications. It uses a three-column structure on the page.
*   **Typography**: The font is a standard Mincho style typical of mid-century printing. It uses historical kana orthography (kyū-kanazukai) such as "いつたらう" instead of "いったら". It also uses the iteration mark (々 or the vertical squiggle 〜) for repeated characters (e.g., いろ〜).
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The main body text is the focus. There is a small line-art illustration in the top left depicting two characters—likely the Imam and perhaps Abdura—in a style that suggests a Southeast Asian or colonial setting.
*   **Pagination**: The page is numbered "-31-" at the bottom center.
*   **Author/Series Tag**: "トワン・ドクトル" (Tuan Doktur) appears at the end of the first section. This suggests it might be part of a series of stories by or about a "Tuan Doctor" (likely a reference to colonial medical officers or travelers in the Dutch East Indies/Indonesia).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era**: The language and typesetting suggest the **late 1940s to early 1960s**. The use of historical kana combined with modern-style storytelling is a hallmark of this transition period.
*   **Setting**: The names (Abdura/Abdullah, Ahama/Ahmad, Imam) and the reference to "Ara Manis" (likely from Malay/Indonesian *Allah Manis* or a fictionalized deity name) point toward **Indonesia or Southeast Asia**.
*   **Tuan Doktur**: "Tuan" is a Malay/Indonesian title for "Master" or "Sir." This title was often used for Europeans or respected professionals. This story is likely a Japanese adaptation of a colonial-era folk tale or a satirical piece set in the South Seas (Nan'yō).
*   **Social Conventions**: The story touches on "Yobai" (night-visiting), a traditional Japanese custom of secret courtship, here transposed into a foreign setting to explore themes of jealousy and communal harmony.
*   **Satire on Religion**: The story mocks religious interpretation. The Imam takes a "dirty cup" and declares it a holy relic to "solve" the problem of jealousy by essentially making adultery irrelevant. It’s a cynical yet humorous take on how religious "miracles" are manufactured to maintain social order.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **あつし (Asshu)**: A dialectal or archaic first-person pronoun, often used by working-class men or in specific regions (like Edo/Tokyo). Here it gives Abdura a distinct, somewhat rough-around-the-edges character voice.
*   **おむろに (Omuro ni)**: Usually written as *yaora*, meaning slowly or deliberately.
*   **レイケン (Reiken - 霊験)**: Divine efficacy; the manifestation of a god's power.
*   **斬ったはった (Kitta-hatta)**: A phrase describing violent fighting or swordplay (lit. "slashing and striking").
*   **アラ・マニス (Ara Manis)**: A name likely derived from Malay *Manis* (sweet). The text identifies it as the "God of Love Affairs" (色事の神様).
*   **神様の仕業 (Kamisama no shiwaza)**: "God's doing" or "the work of God." Often used ironically in modern Japanese to describe something inexplicable.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Absurdism and Irony**: The "mystery" of the leaking cup is "solved" by a nonsensical religious explanation that actually encourages communal spouse-sharing (or at least indifference to infidelity) to prevent violence.
*   **The Destructive Nature of Jealousy**: The first half describes a man so driven by jealousy that he nearly commits a violent act (possibly a crime of passion). The "holy cup" serves as a psychological placebo to cure this social ill.
*   **Anti-Moralism**: Unlike traditional fables that teach "fidelity," this story concludes that the true blessing is a society where "no one knows who is whose spouse," suggesting that rigid social structures and possessiveness are the actual causes of suffering.
*   **Subtext of the Foreign "Other"**: By setting the story in a distant land with Muslim names, the Japanese author/translator can explore taboo subjects like rampant infidelity and the "manufacture" of religion in a way that might have been more difficult if set in Japan.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type**: Fiction, Folk Tale, Satire, Short Story.
*   **Thematic Tags**: Jealousy, Adultery, Religion, Humor, Colonial Setting, Southeast Asia, Folklore Adaptation.
*   **Classification**: Literary / Adult Fiction (due to the themes of infidelity and implied violence).
