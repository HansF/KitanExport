## Literal English Translation

If so, even a single word, how should I convey it? Because of the established transmission,
at the time when there was no transmission, it seems it was written roughly about oil
and collected.
Even though the number of its grains of sand is counted
more than anything else, things difficult for young ears to perceive
are of no benefit in writing, and moreover, the brush should not touch them.
Therefore, descend for a while, climb up to higher places
than before, and proceed further than before,
because they are the stages/numbers of the sage (Hijiri).
If one reflects well upon seeing these copied/cited writings,
they may become a help in climbing high and going far.
Rather than presenting the beginning [of the journey] to the world,
it means that you are drawing closer day by day than before.
Climbing the high mountain, mastering it day by day,
The philosopher says that the sun rises until the days you make it reality—
It truly seems to be so.

Always, one should not neglect the traditional training;
If it is assumed to be something that naturally exists without training,
if it reaches the text, it should be well repeated, one by one, the texts
like the Women's Four Books, and stated as difficult.
If I guard it, (it is) a certain stone; if I guard the trace of my brush,
this certain stone is the only joy
which I obtain. This writing is heart-skill/intent. Now then,
since I have written [this] at an opportune moment, I assume
it is something that always inquires in my heart and which I nod to as song.
Although it is not something that becomes teaching beforehand,
it is not something I am just saying to you again either;
My only wish that it be proper/suitable is because I have the heart of a parent carrying their child,
it seems that I am repeatedly pondering the gradual decline of my elderly body.
○ One thing is, realizing that one must be respectful and cautious in the dead of night,
and being ashamed of being deficient as a man, so they say.
It seems that here, it is a matter of making people enjoy a heart without color (Mui, neutral/detached).

## Literary English Translation

If that is the case, how should I transmit even a single word? It appears a rough manuscript concerning ‘oil’ was collected and compiled during a time when established traditions were absent.
Though its contents are numerous, even beyond the count of sand grains, matters that are too difficult for the young ear to grasp are useless in writing, and the brush should simply not concern itself with them.
One must retreat for a while, then ascend to higher places than before, and travel farther than before, for these are the stages of the Sage. If you contemplate these cited writings carefully, they will surely aid your climb to the heights and your journey afar.
Rather than presenting the initial stages to the world, the essence is that you draw closer day by day. The philosopher says that the sun continues to rise until the day you make this mastery a reality—climbing the high mountain and perfecting it daily. This is truly the case.

One must never neglect traditional practice. If you assume that success comes naturally without training, when approaching literature, you must diligently repeat and master texts like the Women's Four Books, and speak of the rigor involved.
If I protect this training, it is a steadfast rock; if I protect the trace of my brush, this steadfast rock is the sole joy I obtain. This writing, this expression of heart and skill, which I write at this juncture, I take to be something that constantly queries my heart and to which I assent like a song.
While this may not be offered as a direct, formal instruction, neither is it merely something I am repeating to you. My sole wish that it be suitable arises from the heart of a parent carrying a child, as I repeatedly contemplate the slow retirement of my aging body.
○ Furthermore, there is the issue of realizing that one must be reverent and self-controlled in the dead of night, and being ashamed of one’s failure to fulfill the standard of a man, so they claim. It seems that here, the purpose is to allow others to enjoy a spirit devoid of passion.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Editorial Essay or Didactic Response to a Reader/Contributor. It sets philosophical and moral standards for literary output, especially within the context of the magazine’s genre. |
| **Title/Marker** | `繩` (Rope, Nawa): Likely a thematic keyword or section title, suggesting binding, restraint, tradition, or discipline. |
| **Author Attribution** | Implicitly, the editor or a senior contributor, adopting a high-minded, paternal tone (referencing `人の親の子を負う心`). |
| **Tone** | Highly formal, philosophical, and moralizing, using classical *bungo* style. The tone suggests that the material published must be treated seriously, not merely as sensationalism. |
| **Key Metaphors** | Climbing the High Mountain (self-cultivation); The Stages of the Sage (mastery/enlightenment); Steadfast Rock (integrity); Heart without Color (detachment/sophistication). |
| **Target Audience** | Writers, intellectual readers, and those seeking to rationalize or intellectualize their engagement with transgressive material. |
| **Juxtaposition** | Juxtaposes classical moral education (`女四書`) and rigorous training with the underlying subject matter (suggested by the reference to ‘oil’ and ‘colorless heart’), attempting to elevate the latter. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Bungo Usage:** The extensive use of historical kana (歴史的仮名遣い) and classical grammar marks this text as highly literary and formal, distancing it from everyday language and lending authority to the editor's pronouncements.
*   **The "Oil" Reference:** The mention of `あぶらあらし書` (rough manuscript concerning oil) is opaque. In Showa-era underground literature, this could refer to a specific, perhaps controversial, submission dealing with material aspects of sex, bodily fluids, industrial decay, or possibly an actual physical substance used in a scene.
*   **女四書 (Women's Four Books):** A collection of Confucian-derived texts dictating traditional female virtues and roles (e.g., obedience, fidelity). The text mandates studying these "difficult" standards as foundational practice, suggesting that moral rigor is prerequisite to literary achievement, even if the resulting literature is non-moral.
*   **Masculine Deficiency (おとこたらぬ):** The concept of being "deficient as a man" implies failure to achieve a cultural ideal. In the context of erotic magazines, this failure might be sexual potency or prowess, but the editorial redirects the focus, suggesting true failure is a lack of control or detachment (`しむべき`).
*   **Detachment (色もなき心):** This term is central to understanding the magazine's highbrow aspirations. By recommending a "heart without color" (detachment from carnal desire), the editor encourages intellectualized voyeurism. The goal is to derive pleasure (楽しませる) from observing or writing about forbidden acts without being tainted by vulgar lust (色). This embodies the intellectual posture of the high-level *ero-guro* observer.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Jp) | Normalized Reading | Primary Meaning | Historical/Contextual Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| いかゞかいひつたへん | Ikaga kai tsutaen | How shall I convey it? | Classical rhetorical question expressing difficulty. |
| 眞砂 | Manago | Fine sand/Grains of sand | Metaphor for uncountable multitude. |
| 筆のかゝらなけれ | Fude no kakaranakere | If the brush does not touch it | Should not be written about; unfit subject matter. |
| ひじりの御數 | Hijiri no okazu | The Sage's Stages | Path of virtue or intellectual/spiritual progress. |
| 経わざり | Towa-zari | Not having been trained | Lack of experience or formal mastery. |
| さいれ石わ | Sairu ishi wa | Steadfast rock/Certain stone | Symbolic of integrity, foundation, or discipline. |
| 色もなき心 | Iro mo naki kokoro | Heart without color | Euphemism for intellectual or spiritual detachment, especially from sexual passion (色). |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

*   **Discipline as Transgression:** The core subtext is that true sophistication in handling taboo subjects (which the magazine features) requires immense moral and technical discipline. Only by mastering the "hard" (classical/moral) texts can one approach the transgressive material with the necessary "heart-skill" (心わざ).
*   **Intellectualized Voyeurism:** The ultimate goal—allowing people to "enjoy a heart without color"—suggests the magazine caters to readers who seek not simple smut, but the intellectual frisson of observing or contemplating forbidden acts from a detached, refined perspective. The reader enjoys the *idea* of passion while maintaining personal moral control.
*   **The Editor's Authority:** The tone reinforces the power dynamic: the editor (the aging parent/sage) controls the standards, ensuring that even lowbrow or grotesque submissions are framed within a rigorous, highbrow intellectual structure.
*   **The Irony of Tradition:** The invocation of the *Joshisho* (Women's Four Books) is deeply ironic in an *ero-guro* context. It suggests the need to master societal rigidities precisely in order to subvert them effectively in literature.
