（一）

恵美子が第二の男と遭ったのは、鎌倉から帰って大分経った八月末のことであった。
男は二十七才。自称では画家と言っていたが、自己流に絵筆を持つだけの男。それでも「貴女をモデルに傑作を創り出したい」という絵描きの言葉は、女にとってまさに殺し文句であった。男の画室は農家の納屋を改造した薄暗いがらんとした部屋だった。

でいる下着を徐々に剥いで行った。スーツからスリップが長く現れて腿までを覆っていたが、胡乱な風の触れるのは避けられなかった。男が離れると、恵美子の体は一本のロープにかかって手首や腕の付根が焼けるように痛んだ、その苦痛、羞恥を意識しながらも、額に足場を探って空を蹴らずにはいられぬ程だった。男は恵美子の背後に脚立を持ち出し、それに跨って片手で彼女の衣裳の襟をぐいと掴めつかむと、片手で手首の縄を器用に解いた。二、三度激しくゆすぶられるとスーツもブラウスもスリップも今まで包んでいた女体を落として男の手に残った。パッドを入れたブラジャーだけが残されていたが、それもすぐ男にむしるようにして取られた。
「痩せとるなぁ、キミ、一体何を食っとったんやね。年増の女などには美味い物食うたかて豚みたいに肥えるもんやで。何でキミこんなになんや。」
男は恵美子の背後に回り、いきなりヒップをびしゃく叩いて嘲笑した。男は細引で恵子を後手に縛り、首縄をかけて締め上げた。画室には麻縄、棕櫚縄、荒縄は勿論、芝居の太縄までが揃っていて、その上恐ろしい量の大道具、小道具が金を鈍く光らせた壁際に影を曳いていた。恵美子は初めて気付いた光景の恐怖と締めつけの苦痛に「うー、うー」と身をよじらせて低く呻いた。
男は楽しそうだった。恵美子の前へ自作の**貴絵**を並べた。
「どうや、これ。今日びの体は美しいチェルが据えたやろう。だれはモデル早上がりや。ええ女やなぁ思うと思い切ったモデルにしてもらうやろう、どんなに我慢強いモデルか。泣いたり怒ったりやと二度と来いへん。

## Seeking Suffering (2)

**—From the memoir of a woman who possesses a yearning for the rope**

**Kondo Ichifuji**

(1)

The occasion when Emiko met the second man was at the end of August, a good while after returning from Kamakura.
The man was twenty-seven years old. He called himself a painter, but he was a man who only held a brush in his own style. Even so, the painter's phrase, "I want to create a masterpiece using you as a model," was for the woman truly a killing phrase.
The man's studio was a dimly lit, desolate room, converted from a farmer's shed.

He gradually stripped off the underclothes she was wearing. The slip, long, was revealed, covering her down to her thighs from beneath the suit, but she could not avoid the touch of the strange wind. When the man moved away, Emiko’s body, hung on a single rope, burned at the wrists and the base of her arms, aching. The pain and shame were present in her consciousness, yet she could not kick the air, searching for a foothold for her forehead.
The man brought out a step ladder behind Emiko, and, straddling it, he grabbed the collar of her clothing roughly with one hand, and with the other hand, deftly untied the ropes around her wrists. When she was violently shaken two or three times, the female body that had been wrapped until now in her suit, blouse, and slip fell away, remaining in the man's hands. Only the padded brassiere was left, but that, too, was immediately torn off by the man.
"You're skinny, aren't you, dear? What in the world have you been eating? Even if an older woman eats something delicious, she gets fat like a pig. Why are you like this?"
The man went behind Emiko and immediately slapped her hip *bishaku*-soundingly, and laughed derisively. The man bound Emiko's hands behind her back with thin cord, and attached a neck rope, tightening it.
The studio was stocked not only with hemp rope, palm fiber rope, and coarse rope, but even thick theater ropes were gathered, and furthermore, a terrifying amount of stage props and tools, glinting dully gold, cast shadows against the wall. Emiko, tasting the terror of the sight and the pain of the tightening for the first time, groaned low, twisting her body with sounds of "Uu, uu."
The man seemed joyful. He lined up his own **Precious Paintings** in front of Emiko.
"How about this? A modern body is probably set by a beautiful corset, right? Who cares about models retiring early. I'll take a good woman that I think is nice and turn her into a determined model, alright? If you cry or get angry, no matter how strong a model you are, you won't come back a second time."

## Seeking Suffering (2)

**—From the Memoirs of a Woman Who Yearns for the Rope**

**Kondo Ichifuji**

(1)

Emiko’s second meeting with the man took place toward the end of August, some time after her return from Kamakura.
The man was twenty-seven. He styled himself a painter, but he was merely a man who indulged his self-taught style. Nevertheless, the artist’s utterance—"I want to create a masterpiece using you as my model"—was, for a woman, a truly fatal promise.
The man’s studio was a dim, stark room, renovated from an old farm shed.

He began to strip off the undergarments she wore. Her long slip was exposed beneath the suit, falling down to her thighs, yet she was defenseless against the touch of the strange, drafty air. When the man stepped back, Emiko’s body, suspended by a single rope, felt a searing pain at her wrists and the crook of her arms. The torment and the shame were clear to her, yet she could not kick out, searching for a place to brace her forehead against the void.
The man brought a step ladder behind Emiko, straddled it, and grabbed the collar of her garment fiercely with one hand. With the other, he deftly loosened the ropes on her wrists. After being violently shaken two or three times, the female form, previously shrouded by the suit, blouse, and slip, was abandoned, remaining only in the man’s grasp. Only the padded brassiere was left, but he tore that off instantly, as if ripping something apart.
"You’re thin, aren't you, dear? What have you been eating, I wonder? Even if an older woman eats delicious food, she fattens up like a pig. Why are you so unlike that?"
The man circled behind Emiko and immediately smacked her hip with a *bishaku*-like thwack, howling with laughter. He used thin cord to bind her hands behind her back and fastened a tight neck rope.
The studio held not just hemp, palm, and coarse ropes, but even thick theatrical hawsers, all neatly arranged. Furthermore, a frightening quantity of large and small stage props and implements, gleaming dull gold, cast long shadows against the walls. For the first time, Emiko realized the terror of the sight and the agony of the constriction, twisting her body and moaning softly, "Uhh, uhh."
The man seemed utterly delighted. He lined up his self-made **Precious Paintings** before Emiko.
"How about this? A modern physique is likely molded by a beautiful corset, isn't it? Who cares if models quit early. When I see a good woman, I decide to make her a committed model, right? If you cry or get angry, no matter how tough a model you are, you won't be coming back a second time."

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Pseudo-Confessional/Erotic Pulp Fiction (likely serialized). Presented as an authentic "memoir" (*shuki*) to legitimize the sensational content. |
| **Author Attribution** | Explicitly attributed to 近藤一藤 (Kondō Ichifuji). (The "I" is the female narrator, Emiko, making the listed author the implied editor or transcriber of the "memoir"). |
| **Editorial Voice** | The introduction line ("一繩への憧憬を持つ女性の手記よりー") sets a sensational, clinical/archival tone typical of *Kitan Club* reportage. |
| **Narrator Voice** | The main narrative is first-person (Emiko), detailing her experiences. The man's dialogue uses strong colloquialisms and Kansai-like dialect ("やね," "こないなんや," "やろふ"), marking him as crude, artistic, and domineering. |
| **Target Audience** | Adult male readership interested in BDSM (Kinbaku), the exoticization of artistic sadism, female pain, and voyeuristic accounts of sexual humiliation. |
| **Positioning** | Part (2) of a serialized story, likely placed prominently in the fiction or "real-life account" section of the magazine. Page 32 suggests it follows an introduction or table of contents. |
| **Central Conflict** | The Man (Artist/Sadist) vs. Emiko (Model/Masochist) framed through the lens of artistic creation and absolute control. |

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

| Annotation Point | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Kamakura (鎌倉)** | A coastal city near Tokyo, historically associated with temples and, in the post-war era, as an intellectual and artistic retreat. Emiko returning from there suggests she belongs to a certain cosmopolitan, leisured, or artistic class. |
| **Artist/Model Trope** | The "painter" (画家) using the "model" (モデル) is a highly conventional literary and cinematic setup in mid-20th century Japan (and globally) to explore themes of control, nudity, and the objectification of the female body under the guise of aesthetic pursuit. It grants the man immediate, total authority. |
| **Killing Phrase (殺し文句)** | A Japanese idiom meaning a guaranteed persuasive phrase or a "clincher." Here, the promise of immortality through art overrides Emiko's sense of self-preservation, signaling her willing submission to the narrative of suffering for beauty. |
| **Naya (納屋) / Studio** | Renovating a farm shed into an atelier emphasizes the bohemian, isolated, and non-conventional nature of the artist, creating a perfect, clandestine setting for transgressive acts away from urban norms. |
| **The Rope (縄 / Kinbaku)** | The fetishization of various types of rope (麻縄, 棕梠縄, 荒縄, 芝居の太縄) is central. This is explicit reference to Japanese bondage (Kinbaku/Shibari), which was being codified and popularized within ero-guro magazines like *Kitan Club* during the 1950s and 60s. The detail about "theater ropes" (芝居の太縄) links the act directly to performance, drama, and illusion. |
| **"Older Woman" (年増 / Toshima)** | Emiko's age is undefined, but the man uses "toshima" in a derogatory way. In 1950s Japan, 27 was still young, but the term usually implied a woman past her prime marriageable age (often 30s+). Using it here is a clear psychological attack intended to infantilize, shame, and control Emiko by challenging her value/beauty. |
| **"Bishaku" (びしゃく)** | An onomatopoeic word suggesting a wet, slapping sound, used here to describe the hitting of her hip. It emphasizes the clinical/sensational observation of the violence. |
| **"Chiel" (チエル)** | Likely a transliteration of "corset" (fr. *ceinture* or *corset* itself, or possibly a brand name). This refers to the shaping and constraint of the female body by artificial means. The man argues that her *modern* beauty is manufactured by constraint, linking her BDSM experience directly to conventional fashion controls. |
| **The Art of Constraint** | The underlying philosophy—that beauty is achieved through constraint and discipline—is a common theme in ero-guro literature, justifying pain and humiliation as paths to transcendent aesthetic experience. |

## Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

| Term / Phrase | Reading | Contextual Meaning / Euphemism | Historical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **一繩への憧憬** | Ichinawa e no dōkei | Yearning/Admiration for a single rope (i.e., Shibari/Bondage). | Central theme of BDSM literature in the Showa era. |
| **手記** | Shuki | Memoir, notes, diary. | Used to lend authenticity and weight to sensationalized fiction. |
| **殺し文句** | Koroshi monku | Killing phrase; a powerful, irresistible line used for persuasion/seduction. | Refers to the psychological manipulation using the promise of art. |
| **がらんとした** | Garan to shita | Desolate, sparse, empty. | Creates atmosphere of isolation necessary for the sadist's ritual. |
| **胡乱な風** | Uran na kaze | Suspicious/shady/strange wind. | Suggests the environment itself is unsettling or transgressive. |
| **附根** | Fune | Base/root (of the arm). | Refers to the joint/area where the rope chafes the most—the armpit/shoulder intersection. |
| **足場を探って空を蹴る** | Ashiba o sagutte sora o keru | Searching for a foothold and kicking the air. | Signifies total helplessness and suspension; she cannot fight or stabilize herself. |
| **衣裳** | Ishō | Clothing/costume/garment. | More formal/dramatic than `irui` (general clothing), fitting the theatrical nature of the scene. |
| **年増の女** | Toshima no onna | Older woman. | Used here as a weapon of verbal abuse and humiliation. |
| **びしゃく** | Bishaku | Onomatopoeia for a wet slap or thwack. | Adds a visceral, immediate quality to the violence. |
| **貴絵** | Kie | Precious painting. | The man’s own term for his work, implying self-importance and vanity. |
| **チェル** | Cheru | Corset/Girdle (likely). | A specific constraint item linked to fashion and the artificial creation of beauty. |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

| Theme | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Aesthetic Sadism** | The core theme. Pain, humiliation, and constraint are explicitly framed as necessary steps toward "creating a masterpiece." The artist is less interested in painting than in sculpting the model's emotional and physical state through torture. |
| **The Burden of Art** | Emiko's submission is predicated on the "killing phrase." The text suggests that the pursuit of artistic greatness justifies absolute violation and objectification, turning the model into passive, suffering material. |
| **Totalitarian Control** | The man's methodology (psychological shaming, extensive apparatus of ropes, physical violence) aims at absolute control. His final threat ("If you cry or get angry... you won't come back") solidifies the power dynamic: only through silent, complete compliance can she achieve the status of a "committed model." |
| **Voyeurism and Display** | The lining up of the paintings ("Precious Paintings") in front of the bound Emiko serves multiple purposes: humiliation, demonstrating the "results" of past suffering, and enforcing the idea that her present pain is merely part of a larger, established artistic ritual. The stage props and theater ropes underline the display element. |
| **Shame and Desire** | Emiko experiences conscious "pain and shame" (苦痛、羞恥) yet remains suspended, unable to escape. This confirms the classic masochistic dynamic: the desired object (suffering/the rope) is inextricably linked to the despised state (helplessness/shame). |

## Content Classification Tags

| Category | Tag / Intensity |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sexual Content** | High (Stripping, Fetish/Bondage, Nudity/Exposure) |
| **Violence** | Moderate (Slapping/Hitting, Physical constraint/tightening of ropes) |
| **Coercion** | High (Psychological coercion, Verbal abuse, Threat of abandonment if she resists) |
| **Medical / Bodily Themes** | Pain, Burning sensation (from ropes), Physical exhaustion/groaning |
| **Taboo or Illegal Implications** | BDSM/Non-consensual elements (though framed as willing submission, the methods are aggressive), Public display (intended for the artist). |
