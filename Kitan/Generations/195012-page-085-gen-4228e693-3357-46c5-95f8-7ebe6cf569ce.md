――そう、二三年前のことじやつたよ。監視の若い男がうかつ……と、魂のとろけそうな色つぽい眼に誘われて、屋敷に忍びよつた。わしは最初にそれを見つけた。今のうちなら未だわしの外誰も知らぬからと、深入りは止めて御役御免と願出よと云つてやつたのに、もう駄目じや。男ひでのこのゝ女子に見込まれたら、蛇に魅入られたも同然。物の怪に憑かれた様に通い始めて、段々大胆になつてきおつた。遂々伊賀者に見つかつて、同衾の現場を押えられて、女も男も体をバラ／＼にされて不浄門から人知れず運び出されたよ。
　源内は当時を回想して眉をひそめ乍ら、
「いや、これはわしの老婆心じやよ。兎角あの女子衆ときたら、若い男を見れば口をきいて見たくなるらしい。まあ無理もないが。将軍様のお手附じや、我等では……。いや桑原々々。君子危きに近寄らずちゆうてな――」
　ハハン、そんなものかと金平はうなづいて、
――こちとんと、若い者には毒で御座いますな。
と立上つた昨夜の話を思い出して、金平は薄暗くなつた部屋に行燈をつけた。
　屋敷の中でももう仄んのり燈りがついている。その中に数多の女体がうごめいているのだと思うと、金平はやるせなくなつて、
――盛りの女許りが、今宵も亦、忙しくも悲しい夜を迎えるのだ。一体中の様子はどんなだろう
と、思わず知らず好奇心が頭を擡げてくるのであつた。
――永く勤める役でもなし、場所でもない。一度だけ見たい。
　自ら危険を求めようとしている自分に気付くと、金平はカーツと体のほてるを覚えた。
　淋しく増上寺の暮六ツの鐘が響いてくる。
　ハタ〜と障子をふるわせて、秋風が流れて行つた。

（中略）

――源内様、初島の御中臈は随分若い方でござりますな。
　朝夕霜の白くおりる、めつきり冷めたくなつた朝、金平ははだしぬけに、源内に声をかけた。
――そうだ。たしか廿一か二だろう。こゝへ来られたのは十八歳の御時だつたよ。
――ハアン、永い一生をこの屋敷で埋れてしまう……。お気の毒ですな。誠に……。
――そうだな。ましてやお清様だけに尚更お気の毒じや。
――お清様と申しますと？
――将軍様のお手のつかなかつた中臈の事だよ。何でも初島様が仮親立てゝ中臈に上つた時、将軍様はもう大分御弱りじやつた。こゝだけの話じやぞ……。何でも将軍様慶所に初島様が始めて伺候されてその夜お手のつく筈の処、その儘うと〜と眠る様に初島様を抱かれた儘御他界になつたのじやと云う話だよ。世間で云うあの初島様は未だ新鉢と云う奴じやよ。
――ハーン、成程、そうですか……。
　急にハツとした様に源内は
――コレ、金平。
――はあ？
――つまらぬ考えを起したのではなかろうな。同情は禁物だぞ。えゝか、悪い事は云わん。判つてるだろうな――
――俺達のつとめは、命じられただけの事をしておればよいのじや。
　佛頂面をしていても、根は親切な源内は、親身になつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
—Yes, it was a thing of two or three years ago. A young man of the guard carelessly... lured by eyes of a sexy sort that seemed like they would melt the soul, sneaked into the mansion. I found it first. "Since right now, besides me, no one yet knows," I said to him, "Stop going deeper and request to be relieved of duty," but it was already no good. If favored by these women in a man-drought, it is just like being enchanted by a snake. Like being possessed by a malevolent spirit, he began to visit, and gradually became bold. Finally, found by the Iga-men (spies), caught in the act of sharing a bed, both woman and man had their bodies [made] into pieces/scattered and were carried out secretly from the Impure Gate.

Gennai, while knitting his brows recollecting that time:
"No, this is just my meddling concern. Anyway, those womenfolk, if they see a young man, it seems they want to try talking to him. Well, it's not unreasonable. They are the Shogun’s 'hand-attached' (concubines); as for us... No, Heaven forbid (kuwabara). As they say, a wise man does not approach danger—"

"Haha, is that how it is," Kinpei nodded, and "For us and young ones, it is poison, isn't it," he stood up. Remembering last night's talk, Kinpei lit the lantern in the room that had become dim.
Even inside the mansion, faint lights are already on. Thinking that inside there, many female bodies are wriggling, Kinpei became overwhelmed with emotion,
"Only women in their prime, tonight again, will greet a busy yet sad night. I wonder what the inside looks like,"
Unknowingly, curiosity was raising its head.
"It's not a role to serve long, nor a place [to stay]. I want to see it just once."
Realizing he was seeking danger himself, Kinpei felt his body flare up hotly.
Lonelily, the bell of the 'Kure-mutsu' (6 PM) from Zojo-ji Temple echoes.
Flapping/clattering the shoji screens, the autumn wind flowed away.

(Middle omitted)

"Gennai-sama, the O-chuuro (lady-in-waiting) Hatsushima is a quite young person, isn't she."
On a morning where frost falls white, and it has become considerably cold, Kinpei abruptly called out to Gennai.
"That's right. Surely twenty-one or two. When she came here, it was when she was eighteen."
"Haan, to be buried in this mansion for a long life... It's pitiful. Truly..."
"True. Especially since she is an 'O-kiyo-sama,' it's all the more pitiful."
"If you say O-kiyo-sama...?"
"It refers to a Chuuro whom the Shogun never 'touched' (had sex with). Anyway, when Hatsushima-sama established a proxy parent and rose to Chuuro, the Shogun was already quite weakened. This is a story only for here... They say on the night Hatsushima-sama first attended the Shogun's bedchamber, where he was supposed to 'touch' her, he just passed away while holding her as if nodding off to sleep. That Hatsushima-sama they talk about in the world is what they call a 'Shin-bachi' (virgin)."
"Haan, I see, is that so..."
As if suddenly startled, Gennai [said],
"Hey, Kinpei."
"Yes?"
"You haven't come up with a foolish idea, have you? Compassion is forbidden. Listen, I won't say anything bad. You understand, right—our duty is just to do what we are ordered."
Even though he made a sour face, Gennai, who was kind at heart, became earnest/caring.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
"Yes, it happened about two or three years ago," Gennai began, his brow furrowing as he recalled the past. "A young guard grew careless, lured into the manor by a pair of sultry eyes that seemed to melt the very soul. I was the first to catch him. I told him to quit while he was ahead—that since no one else knew yet, he should resign his post and stay away. But it was no use. When a man is singled out by women starved for affection, he’s as good as doomed, like a bird charmed by a snake. He began visiting her as if possessed, growing bolder by the day. Eventually, the Iga spies caught them in bed. Both the man and the woman were hacked to pieces and carried out through the Impure Gate in the dead of night, never to be heard from again."

Gennai sighed. "I only tell you this out of concern. Those women in the inner palace... the moment they lay eyes on a young man, they’re desperate for a word with him. I suppose one can't blame them, but they belong to the Shogun. For the likes of us, it’s best to keep our distance. As the saying goes, 'A wise man keeps clear of danger.'"

"I see," Kinpei muttered, nodding as he rose. "A deadly poison for young men like us, then." Recalling their conversation from the previous night, Kinpei lit a lantern in the darkening room. Outside, faint lights flickered within the great manor. The thought of all those women—their bodies restless within those walls—filled him with a restless melancholy. *All those women in their prime, facing yet another lonely, hollow night. I wonder what it's really like in there...* curiosity began to gnaw at him. *This isn't a post I'll hold forever. I just want to see it, just once.* Realizing he was flirting with disaster, a sudden heat flushed through his body.

The lonely toll of the six o'clock bell from Zojo-ji Temple drifted through the air. A gust of autumn wind rattled the paper doors and swept past.

***

"Master Gennai, the Lady Hatsushima is quite young, isn't she?" Kinpei asked abruptly one morning, as a sharp frost turned the world white.

"Indeed. She must be twenty-one or two. She was only eighteen when she first arrived," Gennai replied.

"To think her whole life will be buried within these walls... how tragic," Kinpei sighed. "Truly."

"True enough. And it is all the sadder because she is an 'O-kiyo-sama'—the Pure One."

"The 'Pure One'?"

"It’s what we call a lady of the court whom the Shogun never actually bedded. By the time Hatsushima was presented to him, the Shogun was already failing. Keep this to yourself, but they say that on the very night she first attended his bedchamber, he fell into a deep sleep while holding her and simply passed away. Despite her title, she remains a 'virgin,' as they say in the streets."

"I see... I had no idea."

Gennai suddenly looked at him sharply. "Now look here, Kinpei."

"Yes?"

"You aren't getting any foolish ideas, are you? Sympathy is a dangerous thing in this place. Mark my words—I’m telling you for your own good. You understand, don't you? Our only duty is to do exactly as we are told."

Despite his gruff expression, Gennai spoke with the sincere concern of a true friend.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is presented in traditional Japanese vertical alignment (*tategaki*), reading from top to bottom and right to left. 
*   **Visual Elements:** A central illustration depicts three figures in Edo-period attire. One man (likely Gennai) is seated and speaking, while another (Kinpei) listens. A woman or a young attendant stands near a traditional lantern (*andon*). The drawing style is characteristic of mid-century magazine illustrations—fine linework with subtle shading.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style. Long horizontal dashes (used vertically here) indicate a change in speaker or a significant pause, a common convention in Japanese fiction of this era. 
*   **Structure:** The page is divided into two main narrative segments separated by a break (marked by "(中略)" meaning "middle omitted"). The first part sets the scene and the danger, while the second part provides specific exposition about a character named Hatsushima.
*   **Special Markers:** Small dots (emphasis marks) are occasionally used to the side of characters to denote specific terms or emphasis, though they are sparse in this specific scan.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era of Publication:** This appears to be from the 1950s. While the story is set in the Edo period, the language is "Modern Literary Japanese" (*bungotai* influences but largely *kougotai* dialogue).
*   **Setting:** The *Ooku* (Inner Palace) of the Edo Shogunate. This was the harem/living quarters of the Shogun's wives and concubines, strictly off-limits to most men.
*   **Hiraga Gennai:** A real historical polymath (physician, inventor, author). In fiction, he is often portrayed as a wise, worldly mentor or a detective-like figure.
*   **Zojo-ji Temple:** A major Buddhist temple in Tokyo (Edo) which served as the family temple of the Tokugawa Shoguns. The "Kure-mutsu" bell refers to the traditional timekeeping system (approx. 6:00 PM).
*   **Social Conventions:** The text highlights the extreme rigidity of the Shogunate. Forbidden romance with the Shogun's women resulted in execution. The "Impure Gate" (*Fujou-mon*) was the gate through which corpses or "unclean" things were removed from the palace.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **老婆心 (Roubashin):** Literally "grandmotherly heart." It means well-intentioned but perhaps meddlesome or excessive concern.
*   **御役御免 (Oyaku-gomen):** Being dismissed or resigning from an official post.
*   **伊賀者 (Iga-mono):** Ninja or spies from the Iga region, often employed by the Shogunate for internal security.
*   **中臈 (Chuuro):** A high-ranking lady-in-waiting in the Shogun's inner palace who could potentially become a concubine.
*   **新鉢 (Shin-bachi) / 生娘 (Araba):** Slang/archaic terms for a virgin. The text uses "Shin-bachi" as a euphemism for a lady who was technically the Shogun's but never had sexual relations with him.
*   **桑原桑原 (Kuwabara kuwabara):** An incantation used to ward off lightning or bad luck; similar to "Heaven forbid" or "Knock on wood."
*   **不浄門 (Fujou-mon):** The "Impure Gate." In the Edo castle/manors, this was the gate used to carry out the dead or trash, symbolizing total disgrace for those who exited through it.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Forbidden Curiosity:** The primary theme is the tension between curiosity (Kinpei) and the cold reality of duty and survival (Gennai).
*   **The "Gilded Cage":** The description of the women "wriggling" inside the manor and being "buried" there for life emphasizes the tragedy of the Ooku system.
*   **Mortality and Power:** The anecdote about the Shogun dying while simply holding a young woman highlights the fragility of the supreme ruler and the hollow nature of the "honor" bestowed upon the concubines.
*   **Warning Against Empathy:** Gennai’s final warning that "compassion is forbidden" is a classic trope in samurai-era fiction, suggesting that in a totalitarian system, feeling for the victims is a death sentence for the observer.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Tags:** Edo Period, Hiraga Gennai, Ooku, Shogun, Forbidden Romance, Samurai Code, Tragedy, 1950s Literature.
