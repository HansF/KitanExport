★ 南大阪の
暗黒街展望
市村里弘

南大阪の玄関、天王寺、新世界、南霞町、飛田、萩之茶屋一帯にかけては、まことに變態と獵奇とを秘めた。隱然と夜の街に君臨する特殊地帶である。
東京の淺草、墨東一帯ほどの深刻なる、デカタン味はないにしても、男娼はいるし、特殊喫茶は多いし、パンパンに至つては無盡藏、木賃宿と敷えあげれば、暗黒街としての一應の御膳が揃つているから、毎日毎夜獵奇を求めて徘徊しても中々興味は盡きないわけである。
幸か不幸かもつて生れた獵奇趣味からあれこれと探しあてた南大阪の珍名所を御紹介しよう。

一、變態男の珍技
處は飛田遊廓、東門石段を降りきつて石塀に沿つた××樓前の通路。時間は一定していないが、遊客の往來の比較的少い、陽の落ちきつた直後や、やま入りの一時間前というた時刻に、あたりの人氣を伺いながら登場する變態男がある。
着こし召した背廣なども、相當に立派でチョビ髭を生やした四十輩の男や、三十四五才の着流しの男、着流しといっても、大島であるから捨てたものぢやない。
私の調査によると男は合計三人はいる。ところで此の變態男はあたりの人のないのを伺い、樓の格子の蔭にひそんで、おもむろに前の鈕をはずし、隠し持つたる松茸を取り出すそして遊女をかい間見ながら、ニタニタ笑つて我田引水に及ぶ。
彼氏の最も好むのは眞赤な色で此れを見ると、無性に昂奮すると見えて、真赤な腰巻や襦袢をちらつとのぞかして貰えば、全く悅に入つてしまう。
ところが、彼氏らは、遊ぶ金がないから、やむなく變態行爲で満足しているのだと、推察するのなら、それは大誤りである。彼等に言わせると、女との正常な應接よりも、此の方がどれだけ異常な昂奮と快感を得るかわからないのである。

二、サディズム女郎
元来、飛田にしろ松島にしろ大阪の遊廓はどう言うものか、通り一遍で、特殊サービス等は中々もつて行きあたらない。
そこへ行くと、流石は京都である祗園、宮川などは、色々の好みに應じた女がおつて、それにいとも親切である。おつと話が横道へそれたがそれは何れ後日のお楽しみとして、ところで最近飛田にサディズムの女郎が、三、四人あらわれた事は全く頼もしい。
××樓のお染さん等はその典型である。彼女は以前、大門筋のカフェーにいたが、例の七ストップでさらりと身を沈めた、當年とつて芳紀まさに二十一才の美人である。
彼女のサディズムと言うのは、相當なもので、少し感じが出てくると客をつかまえて抓ねたり、擦つたをりは、まだよいとして、愈々高潮して感激してくると、無暗矢鱈に噛みつき、果ては馬乗りとなつて首を締める。
殊にアルコールが廻つていると、文字通りの狂的な無茶苦茶の行爲に生傷の三つや四つを負うのは、まだまだ生やさしいもので、うつかりしていると大事なもの迄喰いちぎられてしまうかも知れない。
かと言つて、世の中はよくしたもので、此れで相應に客があるから全く不思議である。どうです一度試めに遊んで見ては、なに生命に別條はないでしょう。保証はしませんが

三、社交喫茶の秘密
大阪中に社交喫茶と名のつくものは誠に多いが、その中で最も面白いのは、なんと言つても飛田附近にしくものはない。
それもグランドは駄目。ボックスの五六脚も並べたチャチャなのが面白い。遊びには夫々コツがあつて夜でも行こうものなら、腹を空かして手脛を引いて待つている女どもにワツとばかりにたかられ、その末が胴震の手前柄、大いしたサービスもして呉れず、阿呆くさい事限りがない。
ゆつくりと手厚いサービスして貰う積りなら白晝行くことである。部屋が薄暗くて、女は裏番が一心か二人しかいないから、たかられると言う心配がない。
欠伸ばかりして退屈しきつている矢先だから、此れ幸いと中々サービスよい。もともと此處らの社交喫茶

東京の浅草、墨東一帯ほどの深刻なるデカダン味はないにしても、男娼はいるし、特殊喫茶は多いし、パンパンに至っては無尽蔵、木賃宿と数え上げれば、暗黒街としての一応の御膳が揃っているから、毎日毎夜猟奇を求めて徘徊しても中々興味は尽きないわけである。
幸か不幸か持って生まれた猟奇趣味からあれこれと探しあてた南大阪の珍名所をご紹介しよう。

場所は飛田遊廓、東門の石段を降りきって石塀に沿った××楼前の通路。時間は一定していないが、遊客の往来が比較的少ない、日が落ちきった直後や、山入りの一時間前といった時刻に、あたりの人気を伺いながら登場する変態男がある。
着こなした背広なども相当に立派でちょび髭を生やした40代輩の男や、34、5歳の着流しの男。着流しといっても、大島紬であるから捨てたものではない。
私の調査によると男は合計3人はいる。ところでこの変態男はあたりの人のないのを伺い、楼の格子の陰に潜んで、おもむろに前のボタンを外し、隠し持った「松茸」を取り出す。そして遊女を垣間見ながら、ニタニタ笑って我田引水（自慰行為）に及ぶ。
彼らが最も好むのは真っ赤な色で、これを見ると無性に興奮すると見えて、真っ赤な腰巻きや襦袢をちらりと覗かせてもらえば、全く悦に入ってしまう。
ところが、彼らは「遊ぶ金がないから、やむなく変態行為で満足しているのだ」と推察するのなら、それは大間違いである。彼らに言わせると、女との正常な応接よりも、こちらの方がどれだけ異常な興奮と快感を得るかわからないのである。

二、サディズム女郎
元来、飛田にしろ松島にしろ大阪の遊廓はどういうものか、通り一遍で、特殊サービス等はなかなか行き当たらない。

××楼のお染さんなどはその典型である。彼女は以前、大門筋のカフェーにいたが、例の「七ストップ（ダンスホール閉鎖等の規制）」でさらりと身を沈めた、当年とって芳紀まさに21歳の美人である。
彼女のサディズムというのは相当なもので、少し感じが出てくると客を捕まえてつねったり、擦ったりする内はまだよいとして、いよいよ高潮して感激してくると、むやみやたらに噛みつき、果ては馬乗りとなって首を絞める。
特にアルコールが回っていると、文字通りの狂的な無茶苦茶の行為に、生傷の3つや4つを負うのはまだ易しい方で、うっかりしていると大事なものまで食いちぎられてしまうかもしれない。
かと言って、世の中はよくしたもので、これで相応に客があるから全く不思議である。どうです一度試しに遊んでみては。なに、生命に別状はないでしょう。保証はしませんが。

三、社交喫茶の秘密
大阪中に「社交喫茶」と名のつくものは誠に多いが、その中で最も面白いのは、なんと言っても飛田付近に及ぶものはない。
それも「グランド」は駄目。ボックスの5、6脚も並べた安っぽいのが面白い。遊びにはそれぞれコツがあって、夜でも行こうものなら、腹を空かして手ぐすねを引いて待っている女どもにワッとばかりにたかられ、その末が震える手前、大したサービスもしてくれず、阿呆らしい限りがない。
ゆっくりと手厚いサービスをしてもらうつもりなら、日中に行くことである。部屋が薄暗くて、女は店番が一人か二人しかいないから、たかられる心配がない。
あくびばかりして退屈しきっている矢先だから、これ幸いとなかなかサービスが良い。もともとここらの社交喫茶……

★ South Osaka's
Underworld Prospectus
By Ichimura Satohiro

The gateway of South Osaka, Tennoji, Shinsekai, Minami-Kasumicho, Tobita, Haginochaya area throughout, truly perversion and the bizarre are hidden. Quietly in the night streets reigning, it is a special zone.
Tokyo’s Asakusa or Bokuto area-like deep decadence flavor might not be there, but male prostitutes exist, special cafes are many, and as for "pan-pan" (prostitutes), they are inexhaustible. If one counts the flophouses, as an underworld’s one-course meal it is complete; therefore, every day and night seeking the bizarre and loitering, interest does not end.
Whether fortunately or unfortunately, from a born-with interest in the bizarre, these and those found South Osaka strange famous places, I shall introduce.

1. Perverted Men’s Strange Techniques
The place is Tobita Brothel District, having descended the East Gate stone steps, the path along the stone wall in front of XX Brothel. Time is not fixed, but when customers’ coming and going is relatively few, immediately after the sun has completely fallen, or the hour before "mountain entry" (closing/peak time), while watching for people’s presence, the perverted man appears.
Well-worn suits and such are considerably respectable, a man in his 40s with a toothbrush mustache, or a man of 34-35 years in casual kimono—even if casual, it is Oshima silk, so it is not something to be thrown away.
According to my investigation, men total three people. By the way, this perverted man watches for no people being around, hides in the shadow of the brothel’s lattice, slowly undoes the front buttons, and takes out the hidden "matsutake mushroom" (phallus). And while glimpsing the courtesans, grinning, he engages in "drawing water to his own field" (masturbation).
What he likes most is a bright red color; seeing this, he appears to get intensely excited; if he is shown a glimpse of a bright red waist-wrap or undergarment, he falls into total ecstasy.
However, if one surmises these men, "because they have no money to play, they are forced to be satisfied with perverted acts," that is a big mistake. According to them, more than normal dealings with women, they do not know how much abnormal excitement and pleasure they obtain from this.

2. Sadism Prostitutes
Originally, whether Tobita or Matsushima, Osaka’s brothel districts, how should I say, are perfunctory; special services and such are hard to come by.
In that regard, as expected of Kyoto, Gion, Miyagawa and such have women responding to various tastes, and are extremely kind. Oops, the talk has strayed to a side path, but that will be a pleasure for another day. By the way, recently in Tobita, the appearance of 3 or 4 sadism prostitutes is truly encouraging.
XX Brothel’s O-some-san and others are the typical examples. She was previously at a cafe on Daimon Street, but with the "Seven Stops" (regulations), she nimbly submerged herself (into the red-light district); she is a 21-year-old beauty of the flowering age.
Her sadism is considerable; when a little feeling comes out, she catches the guest and pinches or rubs—while doing that it is still okay—but when she finally reaches a climax and becomes moved, she bites recklessly, and in the end, gets into a horse-riding position and strangles the neck.
Especially when alcohol is circulating, in literal mad-chaotic acts, bearing three or four raw wounds is the easy part; if one is careless, even "important things" might be bitten off.
That said, the world is well-made; because there are a corresponding number of guests for this, it is totally mysterious. How about it, won't you try playing once? Well, there will be no threat to life. I don't guarantee it, though.

**A View of the South Osaka Underworld**
*By Satohiro Ichimura*

The gateway to South Osaka—the sprawl encompassing Tennoji, Shinsekai, Minami-Kasumicho, Tobita, and Haginochaya—is a twilight zone where perversion and the macabre reign in secret. While it lacks the profound, decadent "flavor" found in Tokyo’s Asakusa or the Bokuto district, it offers a full menu of underworld delights: male prostitutes, "special" cafes, an inexhaustible supply of *pan-pan* girls, and endless rows of cheap flophouses. For those who wander these streets night after night in search of the bizarre, the fascination never fades. Whether by fortune or curse, my innate thirst for the strange has led me to discover several "curious landmarks" in South Osaka, which I shall now introduce.

**1. The Strange Rituals of the Pervert**
The setting is the Tobita Brothel District. Specifically, the alleyway running along the stone wall of the [Censored] Brothel, just down the stone steps from the East Gate. The timing varies, but usually, just after sunset when the crowds thin, or an hour before the peak "mountain entry" time, a certain man appears, warily scanning his surroundings. He is surprisingly well-dressed, perhaps a forty-something in a decent suit with a toothbrush mustache, or a man in his mid-thirties wearing a casual kimono—and an expensive Oshima silk one at that.
My investigation reveals there are three such men. This particular fellow waits for the coast to clear, ducks into the shadow of a brothel’s wooden lattice, slowly unbuttons his fly, and produces his "matsutake mushroom." Grinning to himself as he catches glimpses of the women inside, he proceeds to "irrigate his own field."
His greatest trigger is the color red. It seems to drive him into a frenzy; a mere flash of a scarlet waist-wrap or an undershirt is enough to send him into total rapture. One might assume these men resort to such acts because they lack the funds to actually buy a woman, but that would be a grave error. In their own words, the "abnormal" thrill they derive from this far exceeds any pleasure found in a standard encounter.

**2. The Sadistic Courtesan**
Generally speaking, the brothels of Osaka—be they in Tobita or Matsushima—are rather businesslike. One rarely encounters "specialized" services. In that regard, Kyoto reigns supreme; in Gion or Miyagawa-cho, you can find women tailored to every imaginable taste, and they are exceedingly hospitable. But I digress—I’ll save that for another time. For now, it is "heartening" to report that three or four sadistic prostitutes have recently appeared in Tobita.
O-some-san of the [Censored] Brothel is the prime example. Formerly a waitress at a cafe on Daimon Street, she "submerged" herself into the red-light district following the "Seven Stops" crackdowns. At twenty-one, she is a beauty in the flower of her youth.
Her brand of sadism is quite intense. When the mood strikes, she begins by pinching and scratching—which is manageable—but as she nears a climax, she loses all restraint. she bites wildly, eventually pinning the guest down and strangling him. When she’s had a few drinks, things turn truly feral. Coming away with only three or four raw wounds is a lucky escape; if you aren't careful, she might just bite off your "crown jewels." 
And yet, as they say, there is a lid for every pot. She has a steady stream of regulars, which is a mystery in itself. Why not give it a try? It probably won't kill you. Though I make no guarantees.

**3. The Secrets of the Social Cafes**
Osaka is crawling with so-called "Social Cafes," but the most interesting ones are undoubtedly in the vicinity of Tobita. Forget the "Grand" establishments; the cramped, shabby holes-in-the-wall with only five or six booths are where the real fun is. There’s a trick to it, though. If you go at night, you’ll be swarmed by women waiting like hungry wolves to pick your pockets. They’ll fleece you until your hands shake, only to provide abysmal service. It’s a fool’s errand.
If you want genuine, attentive service, go during the day. The rooms are dim, and there are only one or two girls on duty, so you won’t be mobbed. Bored to tears and yawning, they welcome any visitor as a godsend and will treat you quite well. After all, the social cafes in this neighborhood... [Text cuts off]

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a traditional vertical format, common in Japanese periodicals. It utilizes a three-column structure on the page.
*   **Typography:** The title is set in a large, bold, stylized font inside a decorative border with a star icon (★), a common feature in mid-century Japanese tabloids to denote a "feature" or "sensational" story.
*   **Censorship (Fuse-ji):** The text uses "××" (crosses) to mask specific brothel names or potentially "obscene" terms. This was a standard practice in pre-war and post-war Japan to avoid police crackdowns while still signaling to the reader what was being discussed.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The author's name (市村里弘) is placed prominently under the title. Subheadings (一、二、三) are used to break the narrative into thematic segments, a classic journalistic technique.
*   **Tone:** The writing is "Hard-boiled" and "Kasutori" style—sensationalist, gritty, slightly voyeuristic, and written from the perspective of an "underworld explorer."

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s to early 1950s. The mention of "Pan-pan" (prostitutes catering to GIs) and the orthography (traditional kanji) suggest the immediate post-war era.
*   **Geography:** The areas mentioned (Tennoji, Tobita Shinchi, Shinsekai) are historically the "Minami" (South) underworld of Osaka. **Tobita Shinchi** remains one of Japan's most famous "private" brothel districts to this day, operating under the guise of "restaurants."
*   **Social Cafes (社交喫茶 - Shakō Kissa):** These were precursors to modern hostess bars or "snack" bars. In the post-war era, many were fronts for prostitution or "illegal" drinking dens.
*   **Seven Stops (七ストップ - Shichi Sutoppu):** This refers to the 1949-1950 moral crackdowns (often associated with the "Dodge Line" era or local police ordinances) that restricted dance halls and cafes, forcing many women into the more explicit red-light districts (the "submerging" mentioned in the text).
*   **Oshima Tsumugi (大島):** A high-quality, expensive silk fabric from Amami Oshima. The mention of the pervert wearing this suggests he is a man of means, adding to the "strangeness" of his public behavior.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **暗黒街 (Ankoku-gai):** Underworld / The "dark" side of the city.
*   **猟奇 (Ryōki):** Seeking the bizarre, grotesque, or macabre. A major keyword in 1950s pulp literature (*Ryōki* magazines).
*   **我田引水 (Gaden-insui):** Literally "drawing water to one's own field" (a proverb for selfishness). Here, it is used as a euphemism for masturbation.
*   **松茸 (Matsutake):** Literally "matsutake mushroom." A common slang/euphemism for the penis.
*   **パンパン (Pan-pan):** Post-WWII slang for prostitutes who specifically targeted Occupation (mostly American) soldiers.
*   **木賃宿 (Kichin-yado):** Very cheap, basic lodging where travelers paid only for the wood/fuel for cooking.
*   **着流し (Kinagashi):** Wearing a kimono casually without a *hakama*.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **The Voyeuristic Gaze:** The narrator positions himself as a "researcher" or "explorer," inviting the reader to peek into a forbidden world.
*   **Post-War Nihon/Decadence:** The text reflects the "decadent" (*dekatan*) atmosphere of the era—a mix of economic desperation and a breakdown of traditional morality.
*   **Economic Disparity:** The contrast between the "gentleman" in an Oshima silk kimono and his "perverted" public act suggests a society where social status and private deviance were becoming increasingly blurred.
*   **Misogyny and Danger:** The description of the "sadistic" woman portrays female sexuality as something dangerous, feral, and potentially castrating ("biting off important things").

*   **Content Type:** Pulp Journalism, Essay, Reportage.
*   **Tags:** Red-light District, Tobita Shinchi, Post-war Japan, Erotica, Sadism, Fetishism, Urban Exploration, Osaka History, Kasutori Culture.
