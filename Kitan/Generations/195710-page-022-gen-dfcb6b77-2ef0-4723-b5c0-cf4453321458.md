The Dream of the Female Volunteer (Part Two) 22

〈Confession〉

Masaki Shin'ichi

"I'm sorry. I subjected you to such a terrible ordeal.
I didn't know Biko was the uncle's child, you see.
My uncle kept it hidden until now.
I only just found out after hearing the story from Ichirō a moment ago.
My uncle, you know, he can't stand being out in the open [socially acceptable], right?
He and your mother were close when they were young, they say. They separated later due to some circumstances,
but since your mother recently died,
he took you in, they say. Truly,
the mother who gave birth to a beautiful child like you... Even so,
from now on, I will become your mother substitute and cherish you dearly."

She spoke with a sharp expression. Ichirō, the youth, seemed entirely
unaware that he was being deceived, even a fraction...
...I did not answer Rumiko, but glared at Ichirō. Ichirō, with his pale, clear face,
suddenly floated a wry smile around his mouth
and closed one eye at me. It was a signal to stay quiet.
Even if I were told to speak, I probably
would have kept silent. There are things
from a wicked past that must be told and heard
in front of a beautiful woman like this, which does not suit my taste.
Even so, I wanted to ask:

"Say, what kind of people are Ichirō-san and Niimura-san?"
Thinking it was a bad question, I looked at Ichirō. Ichirō returned a gaze that burned with anger and reproach.

From far away, carried by the wind,
the voice came. Gradually, my strength returned, and I blinked my eyes wide open.
My body had been placed on the bed. The restraints had been removed, and my hands and feet
were free. The room, unlike that cold, dismal sickroom,
was a bright Western-style room, and the bed was soft and
comfortable. I tried to stretch fully with a groan,
and Ah! I leaked a small cry at the tingling pain that ran from my chest down to my lower body.
"My, Biko, you've woken up, haven't you?"
I looked toward the familiar voice. Rumiko and a strikingly
white-clothed youth were sitting facing each other, sandwiching a desk beside the bed.
Rumiko seemed to be sympathizing genuinely, and truly,

“I am so sorry. I put you through such a horrible ordeal.
I truly didn't know Biko was my uncle's child.
He’d kept it secret from everyone until now.
I only learned the full story from Ichirō a little while ago.
My uncle, you know, he’s never been someone who could stand the light of day, has he?
They say he and your mother were very close when they were young. They separated later due to certain circumstances,
but since your mother recently passed away,
he decided to take you in. It’s true: the mother who bore such a beautiful girl
like you... even so,
from now on, I will be your substitute mother, and I will cherish you deeply.”

She spoke with a sharp, determined look. Ichirō, the young man, seemed completely
oblivious to the fact that he was being entirely deceived...
...I ignored Rumiko and fixed my gaze on Ichirō. His face, pale and clear,
suddenly curved into a slight, wry smile, and he winked one eye at me. It was a signal to keep quiet.
Even if they had told me to speak, I likely
would have remained silent. To speak of the shameful details
of my wicked past, which I find distasteful, in front of a beautiful woman like this—
why must such things be exposed?
Nevertheless, I felt compelled to ask:

“Tell me, what kind of people are Ichirō-san and Niimura-san?”
Realizing the question was a mistake, I looked at Ichirō. He responded with a searing gaze of anger and sharp reproach.

My strength was gradually returning due to the faint voices
that drifted in on the wind from far away, and I opened my eyes wide, snapping them into focus.
My body had been laid upon a bed. The belts were gone, and my limbs
were free. Unlike that cold, dismal sickroom, this room
was a bright Western-style parlor, and the bed felt plush and
comfortable. I tried to stretch out fully with a soft groan,
and Ah! A small cry escaped me from the fierce, tingling pain that shot from my chest down to my lower body.
“Oh my, Biko, you’ve finally woken up.”
I looked toward the familiar voice. Rumiko and a strikingly
white-clad youth were seated, facing each other, on either side of a desk next to the bed.
Rumiko appeared to be genuinely sympathetic, and truly—

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Section Type** | Fictional Narrative / Serialized Confession (後篇 - Part Two). This structure maximizes readership retention. |
| **Genre** | Ero-Guro/Pulp Fiction presented as intimate *kokuhaku* (confession/testimony), leveraging the thrill of hidden secrets and physical trauma. |
| **Title Context** | "The Dream of the Female Volunteer" implies the protagonist (Biko/Meko) is involved in some organized, potentially medical or sexual, activity. The "dream" aspect suggests unconscious experimentation or trauma. |
| **Author Attribution** | Explicit: 真崎 伸一 (Masaki Shin'ichi). |
| **Editorial Voice** | Absent. The text maintains a strict first-person internal narrative (I/私) intermixed with dialogue. |
| **Narrator Voice** | Female (Biko/Meko), confused, recently traumatized, emotionally conflicted, passive/submissive but internally observant. |
| **Target Audience** | Readers seeking sensational content mixing psychological drama, sexual taboo (implied incest and non-consensual activity), and clinical settings. |
| **Punctuation Style** | Standard mid-20th-century Japanese narrative style (use of ellipses, Japanese quotation marks). |
| **Key Characters** | **Biko/Meko** (Protagonist/Narrator), **Rumiko** (The "substitute mother," perhaps the uncle's wife or partner, who offers a cover story), **Ichirō** (The young man who seems to be the operational controller, sending silent signals), **The Uncle** (The hidden, socially unacceptable figure who initiated the events). |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Theme/Reference | Contextual Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **「女性志願者」 (Female Volunteer)** | In the context of *Kitan Club* era publications (mid-Showa, 1950s), "volunteer" often denotes a woman participating in sexually or medically deviant activities, usually framed as scientific curiosity or moral/social experimentation. This lends a veneer of clinical seriousness to what is pulp erotica. |
| **「告白」 (Confession)** | A common narrative device in postwar Japanese literature and pulp magazines. It provides a moral framework (repentance, revelation) while simultaneously allowing the explicit description of taboo acts. |
| **Incest/Illegitimacy Theme** | Rumiko's explanation frames Biko's trauma within a familial drama (Biko is the uncle's illegitimate child, now adopted). This melodrama softens the initial shock of the trauma but introduces a new sexual taboo (potential incestuous desires from the uncle). The uncle is described as someone who "can't stand being out in the open" (陽におけない), suggesting a social outcast or person of questionable reputation. |
| **"Hidoi Me" (ひどい目)** | A pervasive euphemism in this genre for severe physical hardship, abuse, or, most commonly, sexual violation or assault. The vagueness enhances the sense of trauma. |
| **The Two Rooms** | The switch from the "cold, dismal sickroom" (冷い陰惨な病室) to the "bright Western-style room" (明るい洋間) signifies a transition from immediate, brutal control (medical/physical) to psychological control (domestic/paternalistic cover story). This shift in environment is crucial to the manipulation. |
| **Tingling Pain (ヒリヒリ走った痛み)** | The specific description of localized pain from the chest down to the lower body confirms recent, invasive physical trauma, strongly implying either a medical procedure (surgery, abortion, or examination) or sexual violence, suggesting that the "dream" was actually a period of physical subjection. |
| **Postwar Clothing/Aesthetics** | The "strikingly white-clad youth" (著白い青年) suggests either a pseudo-medical uniform or a clean, modern, Western appearance, contrasting with the dark deeds being discussed. |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (JP) | Literal Meaning | Contextual/Euphemistic Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **女性志願者** (Jōsei Shigansha) | Female Applicant/Volunteer | Subject of medical/sexual experimentation; someone participating in a taboo activity for questionable reasons. |
| **ひどい目** (Hidoi Me) | Terrible eyes/experience | Severe ordeal; trauma; abuse; often sexual assault. |
| **陽におけない** (Hi ni Okenai) | Cannot be placed in the sun | Socially unacceptable; disreputable; morally compromised; hidden from public view. |
| **剣な顔つき** (Ken-na Kaotsuki) | Sharp/stern expression | Determined, severe, or artificial expression; masking deeper intent. |
| **陰惨な病室** (Inzan na Byōshitsu) | Dismal/gloomy sickroom | A setting for control, confinement, or unethical procedures; often implying institutional/clinical authority. |
| **ヒリヒリ走った痛み** (Hiri-hiri Hashitta Itami) | Tingling/stinging pain that ran | Physical sensation linked to recent trauma, especially in the genital/lower abdominal area, indicating surgical recovery or recent sexual intrusion. |
| **詰責** (Shisseki) | Reproach; sharp scolding | Intense moral condemnation or scolding, often implying a breach of a secret agreement or command. |

## Themes & Subtext

| Theme | Analysis of Subtext |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Control and Manipulation** | The entire scene is a process of transitioning the victim (Biko) from physical restraint (the belt and sickroom) to psychological control. Rumiko provides a plausible, sentimental narrative (mother replacement/illegitimacy) while Ichirō enforces the immediate command (stay quiet) through non-verbal cues and later through anger. |
| **Medical Voyeurism** | The initial environment (sickroom, restraints, awakening) strongly suggests a medical or pseudoscientific context. The narrator is the object of study or observation by Rumiko and Ichirō, fulfilling the ero-guro trope of the helpless female subject. |
| **Sexual Shame and Past** | The narrator expresses a profound reluctance to discuss her "wicked past" (悪しき過去) in front of the "beautiful woman" (Rumiko). This suggests the trauma involves deep personal shame, likely sexual in nature, which the handlers (Ichirō) are eager to keep concealed, even while using it as leverage. |
| **The Failed Escape** | The narrator’s tentative question about Ichirō and Niimura-san is a small, conscious attempt to assert agency and understand her captors. Ichirō’s violent, silent glare immediately shuts down this effort, reinforcing the power hierarchy. |
| **The Mother Substitute** | Rumiko's offer to be a "mother substitute" (お母さん代り) is highly ironic and manipulative, attempting to bind the victim emotionally under the guise of care, directly following severe abuse. This trope is common in pulp fiction dealing with corrupted domesticity. |
