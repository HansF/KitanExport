**恋愛百貨店**
**夜草京介**

**一、昇降機とセコハン娘**

「皆様、毎度ご来店下さいまして、有難う御座います。次は六階で御座います。呉服、洋服、化粧品、装身具、御家庭用品賣場へお越しのお客様は、六階でお降り下さいませ。皆様、混合しまして恐れ入りますが、懐中物にご用心下さいませ」

エレベータ係のナンバーワン奈美子嬢も、これを一日百万遍唱えてハンドルを廻さないと、月末のサラリーは戴けない。一見楽なようでも、その実一日立ちんぼの彼達達は、定刻の六時にならないと、自由な世界に解放されない、まったく罐詰同様の箱入娘なのである。

だが、此の箱入娘には、チョイ／＼変な虫がつく。二階に降りる様子もなく、三階に来ても向その気配のない、一往復の直通組は、たいてい戦後派の接触狂なのである。

制服が夏の薄物に変って、肌の色が透いて見える程、腰の輪郭がクツキリと浮び上ると、余程警戒を厳にしないと身動も出来ない満員の中をいいことにした、これ絶好のチャンスとばかり、グンゝ後から押してくる。

臀部に妙な重圧を感じて、ヒョイと後を振返えると、案に違わず眼尻を下げに痴漢がニヤリと北奥笑んでいるのだ。

ジーンと悪感が腰を顫わす、それでも大切なお客様だと思うと、腹の虫は納まるけれど咽喉元まで「皆様混合しまして恐れ入りますが、お尻に充分ご用心下さいませ」と、危く声を出したかも知れないのだ。そうして格子のの中の処女？は、丁度安物の寒暖計のように、鮨詰の超過員で蒸されては昇り、同輩達に冷かされて降りるのだ。エレベーターは上昇する……。

「次は七階で御座います。書籍、写真機、時計、運動具、電気器具賣場で御座います。只今当店でお買上げの時計は修理無料サービス中で御座いますから、どなた様も精々ご利用下さいませ」

七階の賣場で扉を開くと、妙齢の美人が香料を漂わせてシャナリ／＼と降りて行く。

しかも時計賣場の方へ、
「アラ……」途端に奈美子嬢の眉が曇った。無理はない、彼女の恋人高野君は、目下修理サービス中の、時計賣場に勤めているのだ。

だから綺麗な婦人が七階で降りて行くと、彼嬢の胸裡はおだやかではない、嫉妬と不安に心臓を轟かせて、ジッと後姿を見送っていると、いきなりその肩をポンと叩かれた。振返って見ると、空っぽになったエレベーターに、意外や高野君が微笑で立っている。

「まあ？意地悪ッ、びっくりしたじゃないの、蔭に隠れてたのね」
故意と怒りを誇張して、ツンと邪慳にそっぽ向く、だが喧嘩の出来る間柄は、たよの中ではありえない、二人つきりのエレベーターは音もなくスルーと扉を閉じると、七階と八階の中間で、器用にピツタリと止められて了う、いや止ったのだ。それも当然、奈美子嬢はハンドルならぬ長身の高野君の胸に、力一杯獅噛付いているのである。眼を閉じて、背伸びをして、それから……

「ね、昨昨日産婦人科で診て貰つて来たのよ。矢張り駄目だつたワ、子宮後屈なんですつて……」
「ヘエー、愈々そうすると絶望かい？よつぽど君の機械は悪いんだね」

時計屋の技師高野君は、すべで複雑なものは皆キカイらしい。
「まアー機械だなんて、嫌だワ……姿をセコハンにして置いて、貴男が無理をしたからよー」

高野君の迂闊な一言に、すつかりつむじを曲げた奈美子嬢。だが、此のカイイばかりは流石の技師の高野君も手が出ないのか、舌編三回に、三拝九拝の詫びキッス……。
一方、迷惑したのはお客様達である。昇降口に殺到したものの、一向動く気配がない。
「どうしたのでしょうね、上りも下りもしませんが？」
「多分機械の故障なんでしょう」
「ハ、ハア……随分無理をして使つたンですね」

**二、戀は将棋盤の上から**

讀者諸氏はデパートの女店員諸嬢のストツキングに、時々異状の有ることをご存じであろうか？電線ではありませんゾ、それでは何？
えゝちぎれてえ！つまりその、セイリ日にストツキン……

**恋愛百貨店** (Ren-ai Hyakkaten)
**夜草京介** (Yagusa Kyosuke)

**一、昇降機とセコハン娘** (Shōkōki to Sekohan-musume)

「皆様、毎度ご来店くださいまして、ありがとうございます。次は六階でございます。呉服、洋服、化粧品、装身具、ご家庭用品売場へお越しのお客様は、六階でお降りくださいませ。皆様、混み合いまして恐れ入りますが、懐中物にご用心くださいませ」

エレベーター係のナンバーワン奈美子嬢も、これを一日百万遍唱えてハンドルを回さないと、月末の給料（サラリー）はいただけない。一見楽なようでも、その実一日立ちっぱなしの彼女たちは、定刻の六時にならないと、自由な世界に解放されない、まったく缶詰同様の「箱入り娘」なのである。

だが、この箱入り娘には、ちょいちょい変な虫がつく。二階に降りる様子もなく、三階に来てもなおその気配のない、一往復の直通組は、たいてい戦後派の接触狂（タッチ・マニア）なのである。

制服が夏の薄物（うすもの）に変わって、肌の色が透けて見えるほど、腰の輪郭がくっきりと浮き上がると、よほど警戒を厳にしないと身動きもできない満員の中をいいことにした、これ絶好のチャンスとばかり、ぐんぐん後ろから押してくる。

臀部に妙な重圧を感じて、ひょいと後ろを振り返ると、案に違わず目尻を下げた痴漢がニヤリと薄笑いを浮かべているのだ。

ジーンと悪寒が腰を震わせる。それでも大切なお客様だと思うと、腹の虫は収まるけれど、喉元まで「皆様混み合いまして恐れ入りますが、お尻に十分ご用心くださいませ」と、危うく声を出しかけたかもしれないのだ。そうして格子の中の処女（？）は、ちょうど安物の寒暖計のように、すし詰めの超過員で蒸されては昇り、同僚たちに冷やかされて降りるのだ。エレベーターは上昇する……。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Love Department Store**
**By Yagusa Kyosuke**

**1. The Elevator and the Second-hand Girl**

"Everyone, every time for visiting our store, thank you. Next is the 6th floor. Customers going to the kimono, Western clothing, cosmetics, accessories, and household goods departments, please get off at the 6th floor. Everyone, it is crowded and I am sorry, but please be careful of your pocket-objects (valuables)."

The number one elevator girl, Miss Namiko, if she does not chant this one million times a day and turn the handle, she cannot receive her salary at the end of the month. Although it looks easy at first glance, in reality, they who stand all day are not released into the free world until the scheduled 6 o'clock; they are truly "boxed-in girls" (sheltered daughters) just like canned goods.

However, to this "boxed-in girl," strange insects (creeps) occasionally attach themselves. Having no sign of getting off at the second floor, and still no sign at the third floor, the "one-round-trip non-stop group" are mostly post-war era contact-maniacs (gropers).

When the uniform changes to summer thin-fabric, to the extent that the skin color shows through and the contour of the hips emerges clearly, unless she is very strictly on guard, they take advantage of the packed crowd where one cannot even move, thinking "this is the perfect chance," and push steadily from behind.

Feeling a strange pressure on her buttocks, she flips around to look back, and not contrary to expectations, a pervert with lowered eyes is grinning and smiling thinly.

A chill shivers through her hips. Even so, thinking they are important customers, the anger in her belly is suppressed, but up to her throat, she almost let out the voice saying, "Everyone, it is crowded and I am sorry, but please be very careful of your buttocks." And so the virgin(?) inside the lattice, just like a cheap thermometer, is steamed by the sushi-packed excess passengers as she rises, and cooled by her colleagues as she descends. The elevator rises...

**The Romance Department Store**
**By Kyosuke Yagusa**

**I. The Elevator and the "Second-Hand" Girl**

"Welcome, everyone, and thank you for shopping with us today. Our next stop is the sixth floor. For those visiting our departments for kimonos, Western apparel, cosmetics, jewelry, and household goods, please prepare to disembark. It’s quite a squeeze in here, so we do apologize for the crush, but please keep a close eye on your valuables."

Namiko, the department store's star elevator attendant, has to chant this script a million times a day while cranking the lever, or she won't see a dime of her salary come month-end. Her job might look easy, but in truth, these girls are on their feet all day, not tasting freedom until the clock strikes six. They are literally "boxed-in beauties," as trapped as sardines in a tin.

But these "girls in a box" often attract a few "pests." You can spot the "Non-Stop Group"—the ones who show no sign of getting off at the second floor, nor the third. Most of them are post-war "touch-maniacs."

Once the uniforms switch to thin summer fabric, revealing the hint of skin and the sharp silhouette of the hips, the situation turns treacherous. Unless she’s on high alert, these men take advantage of the gridlock—where no one can move an inch—thinking it’s their golden opportunity to press in from behind.

Whenever she feels a suspicious weight against her backside and whips around, there he is, just as expected: some creep with a lecherous grin, eyes narrowed in a greasy smile.

A shiver of disgust runs down her spine. Yet, reminding herself they are "valued customers," she swallows her rage. Sometimes, she nearly blurts out, "Pardon the crush, everyone, but please mind your behinds!" And so, this "virgin in a cage" is steamed like a cheap thermometer in the sweltering, jam-packed elevator as she ascends, only to be "cooled off" by the teasing of her coworkers as she comes back down. The elevator continues its climb...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a traditional Japanese vertical (tategaki) multi-column layout. It features a decorative title at the top right with an illustration.
*   **Illustration:** A line-art drawing of a man and woman in a romantic pose, framed with a scalloped border. It uses a "Westernized" style typical of early Showa-era or post-war magazine illustrations.
*   **Typography:** The title "恋愛百貨店" uses a bold, stylized font. The body text uses a standard Mincho typeface of the era, which is slightly denser and more "inky" than modern digital fonts.
*   **Structure:** The page starts with a main title, followed by the author's name, and then a numbered section. It uses dialogue markers (「 」) and punctuation typical of the period (like the double-dash or wavy lines for emphasis).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the largest element, followed by the section header. The use of an illustration at the top draws the reader's eye immediately to the "romance" theme.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The "Elevator Girl" (Erebētā Gāru):** In the mid-20th century, elevator operators in department stores were iconic figures. They were chosen for their looks, voice, and poise, representing the "face" of the modern, urban lifestyle.
*   **Post-War "Sengo-ha":** The text mentions "戦後派" (Sengo-ha - the post-war generation), often associated with a breakdown of traditional morals or a more hedonistic, cynical worldview in the wake of WWII.
*   **"Sekohan" (Second-hand):** A slang term from the English "second-hand." In the context of the story, it's a double entendre or a derogatory/cynical way to refer to someone's romantic "purity" or status, very common in the pulp fiction of the "Kasutori" (dregs) magazine era.
*   **The Department Store (Depāto):** In the 1940s-60s, these were cathedrals of consumption and modernization in Japan, providing a stark contrast to the rubble of the immediate post-war years.
*   **Social Morality:** The text touches on "Chikan" (groping), a persistent social issue in Japan's crowded public spaces. Here, it is described with a mix of gritty realism and the light, slightly scandalous tone typical of popular magazines of that time.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **昇降機 (Shōkōki):** The formal kanji word for elevator. Note that the text uses both this and the loanword "エレベーター" (Erebētā).
*   **セコハン (Sekohan):** Slang for "second-hand."
*   **箱入娘 (Hakoiri-musume):** Literally "daughter in a box." Usually means a sheltered, well-protected girl. Here, it’s a pun because she is literally working inside the "box" of an elevator.
*   **接触狂 (Sesshoku-kyō):** A "contact maniac" or groper (modern term: *chikan*).
*   **鮨詰 (Sushizume):** "Packed like sushi." Equivalent to the English "packed like sardines."
*   **三拝九拝 (Sanpai-kyūhai):** Lit. "three bows and nine prostrations." Meaning to beg or apologize profusely.
*   **子宮後屈 (Shikyū-kōkutsu):** Uterine retroversion. A medical term used here to imply infertility or reproductive issues, which the male character (a watchmaker) insensitively compares to a "broken machine."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Urban Claustrophobia:** The elevator serves as a metaphor for the cramped, suffocating nature of city life and the loss of personal space.
*   **Objectification vs. Professionalism:** The protagonist must remain perfectly polite while being physically harassed. Her "performance" of being a perfect elevator girl is a mask for her internal disgust.
*   **The "Machine" Metaphor:** There is a recurring theme of people being like machines or inanimate objects (canned goods, thermometers, "second-hand" goods, and finally, the biological "machine" of the womb).
*   **Post-War Cynicism:** The dialogue between the lovers (Namiko and the watchmaker) is remarkably blunt and devoid of traditional romanticism, reflecting the "Kasutori" literary style—gritty, sexualized, and focused on the survival of ordinary people.

*   **Genre:** Romance, Social Satire, Pulp Fiction (Kasutori Literature)
