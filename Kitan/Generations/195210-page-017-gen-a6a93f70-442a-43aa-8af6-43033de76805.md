## Output

```
I am standing by as your **Lead Archivist and Translator**. The framework you have provided is excellent; it ensures that the ephemeral and often transgressive nature of mid-century *Kitan Club* (奇譚クラブ) material is preserved with both philological rigor and cultural sensitivity.

**I am ready to begin.** 

Please **upload the image** or **provide the raw text** of the page you wish for me to process. Once received, I will generate the complete 10-point analysis, from the verbatim transcription of historical kana to the thematic subtext and machine-readable metadata.

**Standing by for your input.** (Please attach the image or paste the text below.)
