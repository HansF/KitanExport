It appears you have provided the structural framework and the technical environment (a Vite/React archive template) for the **Kitan Club Archive Project**, but the **specific page image or source text** to be processed is currently missing from your request.

As your **Lead Archivist and Translator**, I am ready to apply the 10-step protocol to any material from *Kitan Club* (奇譚クラブ), *Abunai Kutsitsu* (あぶない果実), *Ura-Mado* (裏窓), or related mid-century *fuzoku* (customs/erotica) publications.

**Please upload the image or provide the raw Japanese text you wish me to analyze.**

Once provided, I will immediately execute the following:

1.  **Faithful Transcription:** Capturing the specific *kyūjitai* (old kanji) and *rekishiteki kanazukai* (historical kana) used in the 1940s–60s.
2.  **Modernization:** Bridging the gap for contemporary readers.
3.  **Two-Tier Translation:** Balancing semantic literalism with the "pulp noir" or "pseudo-clinical" tone characteristic of the era.
4.  **Cultural Contextualization:** Explaining the *kasutori* culture, the "Pan-pan" girl era, the rise of organized SM subcultures in Japan, and the censorship environment of the GHQ/Post-Occupation period.
5.  **Lexical Mapping:** Tracking the evolution of "abnormal" (*hentai*) psychology terminology.
