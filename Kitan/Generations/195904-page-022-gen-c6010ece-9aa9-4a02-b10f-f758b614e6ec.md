**文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き**

「その刃を抜きもやらずに、切尖もて、下腹のはてまで、びりびりと裂き下して、片手を突き入れて、血まみれの胎児をつかみ出されて、
「見よ！　女ども！　このややに産湯をつかわせて、わしに似たかどうか、あらためい！　もし似て居ったならば、秀次、申しわけに、わが腹をも十字にかっさばいてみせるわ！」
と喚きあげられたことでございます。

また岩堀光作「関白秀次」の中には、直接腹裂きの場面は出てこないが「おいとの方の巻」の一節に、おいとの方の姉が腹を裂かれた時の事を、おいとが想像する場面が出てくる。
ふいに彼女は邸第から現われた数人の男共に手足をとらえられると、城中にかつぎこまれた。そして、たちまち有無をいわせず身にまとったものをはぎとられると、仰向きに、戸板にしばりつけられた。おいとには、姉の泣きわめく声がきこえる。懇願し、いくたびか失心しながら、多くの男たちの面白げな眼にさらされる姉の大の字なりの裸形が、眼に浮ぶ。
涙に汚れた顔、乱れた髪の毛——姉は自分に似て肌理のこまかな、白いもち肌をしていた。秀次は、刀の冷めたい切尖を、女のふくれた腹にあてていった。ゆっくりと、起伏にそって、うす皮を弄ぶように撫斬って行く。
永い苦しみと、激しい屈辱。そして数刻の後、姉は、神仏までをも呪って、恋しい良人や、なつかしい自分や、父の名を呼びつつ、死んでいったことだろう。
秀次は、その時、刀の切尖に、とりだした胎児を突刺して、ぶらぶらふりながら、
「なんだ、これが、生命か？」
と、けらけら、声のない冷笑を洩らしたとか——。

岩堀氏のこの文は、うまく逃げたということができよう。生きながら女が腹を切り開かれるということは、恐らく誰も見たことのないことで、どんな状態になるか簡単には想像のつかないところである。

松崎氏や、柴田氏は、いずれも鳩尾に刀を突き刺されるとすぐに魂消え果ててしまうが、或はショックでそうなるかも知れないし、そう簡単には死ぬぬかも知れない。
この間臨時純潔化協会員になって、「母と娘」という映画を見て来たが、その中に帝王切開の場面があった。以前、毎日写真グラフか何かで、帝王切開の連続写真を見たこともあったが、映画というと動きがあるので、また異ったスリルがあった。
腹の部分だけ開けられた布をかけた妊婦が、ベッドの上に横たわっている。画面いっぱいに女の腹部が映る。お腹という感じはしない。メスが動く。スーと皮が切れる。
脂肪が開いて子宮壁が見える。殆んど血が出ない。そうして開かれると子供の顔がのぞく。機械が開かれた腹壁にひっかけられ、腹の穴が大きく開かれる。そうして胎児が引き出される。臍の緒が長くつづいている。全くきれいなものである。麻酔で女がねむっているのだからビクともしない。
しかし秀次の場合はこうはいかなかったろう。女は生きてピクピクしているのだし、外科手術のように血を流さずというわけにはいかないであろう。
恐らく腹から流れ、吹き出る血汐。真赤になった女の体。返り血を浴びた秀次。物凄いなり声——。ちょっと文章では

『見よ、女ども！ この赤子に産湯を使わせて、私に似ているかどうか確かめよ！ もし似ていたならば、秀次、申し訳に我が腹をも十文字にかっさばいて見せるわ！』

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Abdominal Ripping of Women Appearing in Literature**

"Without even pulling that blade out, with the tip, to the end of the lower abdomen, ripping down with a 'biri-biri' sound, thrusting one hand in, grabbing out a blood-smeared fetus,
'Look! Women! Give this infant its first bath, and examine whether it resembles me or not! If it resembles me, I, Hidetsugu, as an apology, will carve open my own belly in a cross shape!'
—it was shouted thus."

Also, in Iwahori Mitsusaku’s "Kanpaku Hidetsugu," a direct abdominal ripping scene does not appear, but in a passage of "The Volume of O-ito no Kata," a scene occurs where O-ito imagines the time her older sister's belly was ripped.
Suddenly, she was seized by her hands and feet by several men who appeared from the residence and carried into the castle. Then, immediately without allowing yes or no, the things she wore were stripped off, and she was tied face-up to a door plank. To O-ito, her sister's screaming voice is heard. Beseeching, fainting many times, the naked figure of the sister in a spread-eagle shape exposed to the amused eyes of many men floats in her eyes.
A face stained with tears, disheveled hair—the sister had fine-textured white mochi-skin similar to herself. Hidetsugu placed the cold tip of the sword against the woman's swollen belly. Slowly, along the undulations, as if toying with the thin skin, he went on stroking/cutting.
Long suffering and intense humiliation. And after several hours, the sister, cursing even the gods and Buddhas, while calling the names of her beloved husband, her dear self, and her father, likely died.
Hidetsugu, at that time, pierced the extracted fetus with the sword tip, and while swinging it danglingly,
"What, is this life?"
He let out a 'kera-kera' voiceless cold laugh, it is said—.

Mr. Iwahori's writing can be said to have successfully escaped (the difficulty of depiction). A woman's belly being cut open while alive is something probably no one has seen, and it is a place where it is not easy to imagine what kind of state it becomes.

Mr. Matsuzaki and Mr. Shibata both (write that) when stabbed in the solar plexus, the soul vanishes immediately, but perhaps it becomes so from shock, or perhaps one does not die so easily.
Recently, becoming a member of the Temporary Purity Association, I went to see a movie called "Mother and Daughter," and in it was a scene of a Cesarean section. Previously, in *Mainichi Photograph* or something, I had seen sequential photos of a Cesarean section, but since it is a movie, there is movement, so there was a different thrill.
A pregnant woman covered with a cloth with only the belly part opened is lying on a bed. The woman’s abdomen is reflected across the full screen. It does not feel like "a stomach." The scalpel moves. *Suu*—the skin is cut.
The fat opens and the uterine wall is visible. Almost no blood comes out. Then, when opened, the child's face peeks out. A machine is hooked to the opened abdominal wall, and the hole in the belly is opened wide. Then the fetus is pulled out. The umbilical cord continues long. It is a completely beautiful thing. Because the woman is sleeping with anesthesia, she does not twitch at all.
However, in Hidetsugu’s case, it likely wouldn't have gone this way. The woman is alive and twitching, and it wouldn't go without shedding blood like a surgical operation.
Probably blood flowing and gushing from the belly. The woman's body turned bright red. Hidetsugu bathed in spray-back blood. A terrible roaring voice—. A little bit, with writing...

**The Depiction of Female Evisceration in Literature**

"Without even withdrawing the blade, he used the tip to rip downward through the lower abdomen with a sickening tear. Thrusting a hand inside, he hauled out a blood-drenched fetus and bellowed:
'Look, you women! Give this brat its first bath and see if it resembles me! If it does, then I, Hidetsugu, shall carve open my own belly in a cross as an apology!'
Such was the cry he let out."

In Mitsusaku Iwahori’s *Kanpaku Hidetsugu*, while a direct scene of abdominal ripping does not occur, there is a passage in the "Lady O-ito" chapter where O-ito imagines her elder sister’s horrific end. 
Suddenly, several men emerged from the manor, seized her by her limbs, and hauled her into the castle. Without a moment's hesitation, they stripped her of her clothes and bound her spread-eagle to a wooden door. O-ito can still hear her sister’s screams in her mind. She envisions her sister’s naked form, pleading and fainting repeatedly, exposed to the cruel, amused gazes of the men.
A tear-stained face, disheveled hair—the sister possessed the same fine-textured, ivory skin as O-ito herself. Hidetsugu pressed the cold tip of his sword against the woman’s distended womb. Slowly, following the contours of her body, he began to slice, almost as if toying with the delicate skin.
Through hours of agony and profound humiliation, the sister surely died, cursing the very gods and Buddhas, crying out the names of her husband, her former self, and her father. 
It is said that Hidetsugu then skewered the infant on his sword-tip and, dangling it before him, let out a hollow, mocking cackle: 
"So, is this all that life is?"

One might say Mr. Iwahori skillfully "escaped" the burden of literal description. To see a woman’s abdomen carved open while she is still alive is an experience few have ever had, making the reality of such a state nearly impossible to imagine.

Authors like Mr. Matsuzaki and Mr. Shibata suggest that a thrust to the solar plexus brings an instant end, but perhaps that is due to shock—it is equally possible that death does not come so easily.
Recently, as a member of the Temporary Purity Association, I viewed a film titled *Mother and Daughter*, which featured a Cesarean section. I had previously seen a photo essay of the procedure in *Mainichi Graph*, but seeing it in motion on film provided a different kind of thrill.
The pregnant woman lay on a bed, covered by a sheet with an opening only for her abdomen. Her stomach filled the screen. It didn't even look like a human body part. The scalpel moved; the skin parted with a smooth *zip*. 
The fat parted to reveal the uterine wall. There was almost no blood. Once opened, the infant's face peeked through. Retractors were hooked into the incision, pulling the opening wide. Then, the fetus was lifted out, the long umbilical cord trailing behind. It was a sight of absolute clinical beauty. Under anesthesia, the woman did not so much as flinch.
But in the case of Hidetsugu’s victims, it could not have been so clean. The woman would have been alive, her muscles twitching in agony; it would have been impossible to proceed without a deluge of blood, unlike a modern surgery.
One can only imagine the blood gushing and spraying from the torso, the woman’s body turned a brilliant crimson, and Hidetsugu himself drenched in the gore, amidst a chorus of horrific screams. It is something that words alone...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The text is presented in a traditional vertical Japanese orientation (tategaki). It is divided into two main columns, though the flow is interrupted by a central illustration. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is placed at the very top of the page, centered above the columns. The page number "22" is in the upper right corner.
*   **Illustration:** The centerpiece is a woodblock-style illustration (likely a *kuchie* or magazine insert style) depicting a woman being restrained by three men. She is partially undressed, reflecting the "Ero-Guro" (Erotic Grotesque) aesthetic popular in mid-century pulp media. The style mimics the *ukiyo-e* of the Edo period but with a more modern, illustrative line.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style typical of mid-20th-century printing. Quotation marks used are the traditional Japanese corner brackets (「 」) and double brackets (『 』).
*   **Design Intent:** The page is designed to shock and titillate. It blends "high" literature (historical novels about the Kanpaku) with "low" sensationalism (graphic descriptions and surgical "thrills").

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The mention of "Temporary Purity Association" (臨時純潔化協会) and films like "Mother and Daughter" (likely *Haha to Musume*), as well as references to *Mainichi Graph* (a famous pictorial magazine), suggests the post-war Showa period. During this time, "Kasu-tori" magazines flourished, focusing on the "Three S's": Sport, Screen, and Sex (often including gore/grotesque themes).
*   **Toyotomi Hidetsugu (1568–1595):** He was the nephew of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After Hideyoshi had a biological son, Hidetsugu was accused of treason and ordered to commit seppuku. His entire family, including 39 women (concubines and daughters) and children, were brutally executed at Sanjogawara in Kyoto. This event is a staple of "cruel" historical tales.
*   **Ero-Guro-Nansensu:** This was a cultural movement that began in the 1920s-30s and saw a resurgence after WWII. It focused on the erotic, the grotesque, and the nonsensical. This article is a prime example, analyzing historical gore through a lens of modern voyeurism.
*   **Cesarean Section (Teio Sekkai):** In the 1950s, medical technology was a source of public fascination. Showing a surgery in a movie was considered a "thrill" (suri-ru), bridging the gap between medical education and sensationalist entertainment.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Hara-kiri / Kappaku (腹裂き):** Specifically "abdominal ripping" or "evisceration," as opposed to the ritualized *seppuku*.
*   **Kissaki (切尖/切っ先):** The point or tip of a Japanese sword.
*   **Yaya (やや):** An archaic term for a baby or infant (赤ん坊).
*   **Ubuyu (産湯):** The first bath given to a newborn baby.
*   **Mochi-hada (もち肌):** "Mochi skin"—white, soft, and smooth skin, highly prized in traditional Japanese beauty standards.
*   **Kera-kera (けらけら):** An onomatopoeia for high-pitched, mocking laughter.
*   **Biri-biri (びりびり):** Onomatopoeia for tearing cloth or skin.
*   **Teio Sekkai (帝王切開):** Cesarean section. The text notes the clinical "beauty" of the modern procedure compared to the "ugliness" of historical violence.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and the Gaze:** The text explicitly discusses the "amused eyes" (面白げな眼) of the men watching the execution. The author themselves is a voyeur, comparing historical slaughter to modern surgical films for "thrills."
*   **Contrast between History and Modernity:** The article juxtaposes the chaotic, bloody violence of the Sengoku/Azuchi-Momoyama period with the sterilized, "bloodless" (or nearly so) environment of a modern hospital. 
*   **Objectification of the Female Body:** Both the historical victim and the modern surgical patient are reduced to their anatomy. The patient doesn't even feel like an "abdomen" to the viewer; she is a screen for the scalpel's movement.
*   **The Nature of Life:** Hidetsugu’s question, "Is this life?" while holding a fetus, reflects a nihilistic fascination with the fragility of existence, a common theme in pulp literature of the era.
