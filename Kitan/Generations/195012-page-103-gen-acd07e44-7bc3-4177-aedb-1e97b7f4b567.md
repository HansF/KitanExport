「あ、真珠（しんじゅ）の耳飾りが欲しいといってたろう？」
「そんなもの、ほしくないわ、ね、今夜だけ行かないで、あたし寂しいワ」
「俺だって行きたくないが、結婚以来だいぶ怠けているから働かなくちゃーさあ、離しておくれ」
夫は、女のような優男だが、むづかる妻を乱暴に突き放し、逃げるように表へ駆け出した。
「あなたあー！」
妻のマリアームは叫んだけれど、もう、夫の姿は、みえなかった。
ーあやしいわ、あやしいわ、いつも夕方出かけて、朝、かえってくると白粉くさいし、カフェーの楽師だなんてどこのカフェーかつきいても教えてくれないし……そうだ、後をつけていってやろうかしらー。
マリアームは、椅子から立上つて、三面鏡の前で髪をつくろい、みどりに五色の草花をあしらつた本絹のカパイヤ（上衣）に着替え、サロン（上袴）もビロードの燃えたつような赤いのと取替え、黒の木靴をはいて表へ出た。

午後五時を過ぎていたが、街はまだ日中のように明るく、街路樹は風にそよぎ若い女と男が仲良く肩をくっつけて笑いながら乗っている赤い三輪車がきらめきながら走ってくる。

「カフェーを片つぱしから廻つてちようだい」

「楽師を雇つているところなら、どこでもいいわ」
「ぢや、マタハリ（太陽）から行きやすぜ」
車夫は、黒檀のような脚で、ぐつとペタルを踏んだ。三輪車は風を切つて走り出した。
マリアームは、唇をキッと噛みしめるんだ薄茶の眸で、じつと前方を見つめながら揺られていた。
傍に夫がいたならどんなに楽しかろうにー。
婚約時代、よく二人が街を乗り廻して、ちろ〜歩いてくる苦力達に冷やかされたりしたことを思い出して、彼女は、胸がうづいた。

"Ah, you were saying you wanted pearl earrings, right?"
"That kind of thing, I don't want, hey, just tonight don't go, I am lonely."
"Me too, I don't want to go, but since marriage I have been idling a lot so I must work—now, let go of me."
The husband is a woman-like gentle-man, but he roughly pushed away his fretting wife and, as if escaping, ran out to the front.
"Darling—!"
The wife Mariam shouted, but already, the husband's figure was not visible.
—Suspicious, suspicious, always going out in the evening, when returning in the morning he smells of face powder, and as for being a cafe musician, even when I ask which cafe he won't tell me... That's it, I wonder if I should follow behind him.—
Mariam stood up from her chair, adjusted her hair in front of the three-sided mirror, changed into a real silk Kebaya (upper garment) decorated with five-colored flowers on green, changed her Sarong (lower garment) to a velvet flame-like red one, put on black wooden clogs, and went outside.

Past five in the afternoon, but the town was still bright like midday, the street trees swayed in the wind, and red tricycles (pedicabs), carrying young women and men happily sticking shoulders together and laughing, come running while sparkling.
Coming to the edge of the pond in Ambon Park, fortunately an empty tricycle came along.
"Please go around the cafes one by one."
"From where shall we go?"
"As long as it's a place that employs musicians, anywhere is fine."
"Then, let's go from 'Matahari' (Sun)."
The driver, with legs like ebony, firmly stepped on the pedal. The tricycle began to run, cutting the wind.
Mariam, firmly biting her lip, with clear light-brown eyes, was being shaken while staring fixedly forward.
If her husband were by her side, how fun it would be—.
Remembering during their engagement period, how the two of them often rode around town and were teased by the coolies who came walking along, her chest ached.

The husband said he was born on Banda Island, which takes two days by boat from Ambon, but from age fifteen he was sent out to earn money, and after that, he bought a house in Ambon and had never returned to Banda even once. He seemed quite good at making money, and besides, being a handsome man and gentle, Mariam's parents had easily permitted the marriage.
When she went to Cafe Matahari, a man wearing a blue sarong came out from the counter and said,
"I don't know him; I have never even hired a musician temporarily."
After that she went around three or four houses but it was the same answer.
"Is there no other?"
"There is one more, 'Bintang Malam' (Star of the Night), but it's a bit far, it's a 'terrible' (intense/amazing) place."
"Fine, please go there."
Mariam thought that if she didn't find out there, she would just drink some alcohol and go home.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Breast Commotion**
*Tales of the South Seas*
*Episode Four*
By Tsukiya Seiji

"You said you wanted those pearl earrings, didn't you?"
"I don't care about those things! Please, just don't go tonight. I'm so lonely."
"I don't want to go either, but I've been lazy ever since we got married. I have to work. Now, let me go."
Though he was a delicate, pretty sort of man, the husband shoved his complaining wife aside and bolted out the door as if he were escaping.
"Darling!"
Mariam cried out, but her husband had already vanished from sight.
*Something is wrong,* she thought. *It's so suspicious. He leaves every evening and comes home in the morning smelling of perfume and face powder. He claims to be a cafe musician, but he won't tell me which cafe... That's it. I'm going to follow him.*
Mariam rose from her seat and tidied her hair in the vanity mirror. She changed into a silk kebaya, its green fabric adorned with blossoms of five colors, and swapped her sarong for one of flaming red velvet. Stepping into her black clogs, she headed out.

Though it was past five, the city was still bathed in the brilliance of the midday sun. The trees along the road swayed in the breeze, and red pedicabs carrying laughing young couples zipped past. When she reached the pond in Ambon Park, an empty pedicab happened to pull up.
"Take me to the cafes," she commanded. "Every last one of them."
"Where should we start, ma'am?"
"Anywhere that hires musicians."
"Then we'll start with the Matahari—the Sun."
The driver, his legs as dark and lean as ebony, jammed his foot onto the pedal. The pedicab surged forward, cutting through the air. Mariam bit her lip, her light brown eyes fixed ahead as she was jostled by the motion. *If only he were here with me, how wonderful this would be...*
She remembered their engagement, how they used to ride through the streets together while the laborers mocked them playfully. The memory made her heart ache.

Her husband claimed to be from the Banda Islands—a two-day voyage from Ambon—but he had left home at fifteen to find work. He had eventually bought a house in Ambon and never looked back. Because he seemed to have a knack for making money and was both handsome and mild-mannered, Mariam's parents had readily blessed their union.
At Cafe Matahari, a man in a blue sarong emerged from behind the bar. "Never heard of him," he said dismissively. "I don't hire temporary musicians."
She tried three or four more places, receiving the same answer at each.
"Is there nowhere else?"
"Well, there's the Bintang Malam—the Night Star," the driver replied. "It’s a bit of a haul, and it’s a wild sort of place."
"Fine. Take me there."
Mariam decided that if she didn't find him there, she would simply have a drink and head home.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page utilizes a traditional vertical layout (tategaki), read from right to left. It features a large, decorative hand-drawn title at the top, followed by the author's name.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "乳房騒動" is the largest element, using a stylized, bold font with star-like decorative flourishes. The series title "南方いざこざ絵巻" is encased in a vertical box on the right.
*   **Illustration:** A central illustration depicts a man in a *songkok* (traditional Indonesian/Malay cap) and a woman in a *kebaya* (traditional blouse). The style is reminiscent of 1950s magazine sketches—expressive but slightly cartoonish.
*   **Typography:** The body text is set in a standard serif typeface common in mid-century Japanese printing. Dialogue is indicated with traditional brackets (「」).
*   **Columns:** The text is divided into three main sections: a snippet at the top left (likely the story's start or a teaser) and two main columns at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The "Nanpou" Genre:** During and after WWII, Japanese literature saw a surge in "Nanpou" (South Seas) themed stories. Initially used for wartime propaganda, in the post-war era (1940s-50s), it shifted toward exoticism, romance, and nostalgia for the former occupied territories (Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.).
*   **Setting:** The story takes place in Ambon, Indonesia. References to "Banda Island," "Ambon Park," and Indonesian terms like "Matahari" (Sun) and "Bintang Malam" (Night Star) ground the story in a specific Southeast Asian locale.
*   **Clothing:** The text mentions the **Kebaya** (カパイ/カバイ) and **Sarong** (サロン). These are traditional garments of the Indonesian-Malay archipelago.
*   **Social Class:** The mention of "Coolies" (苦力 - *kuurii*) reflects the colonial and post-colonial labor structure of the era.
*   **Post-War Sensibility:** The story blends domestic jealousy with an exotic backdrop, a common trope in *Kasutori* magazines (low-brow pulp magazines) that flourished in Japan in the late 40s and 50s. The title "Breast Commotion" suggests a sensationalist or slightly erotic tone typical of these publications.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Jealousy and Suspicion:** The primary driver of the plot is Mariam’s suspicion of her husband’s infidelity, triggered by the smell of "white face powder" (white makeup) on him.
*   **Exoticism vs. Domesticity:** The mundane problem of a cheating husband is transposed onto an exotic, tropical setting, making the "commotion" more alluring to a Japanese reader.
*   **Economic Tension:** The husband claims to be "working" because they have been "lazy since marriage," hinting at the economic pressures of post-war life, even in the "colonies."
*   **The "Vanishing" Husband:** A common trope where the man disappears into the nightlife/underworld, leaving the wife to pursue him into "dangerous" territory (like the Bintang Malam).
