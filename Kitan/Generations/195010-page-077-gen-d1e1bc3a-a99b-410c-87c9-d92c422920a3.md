げに、又寄せてもらひませうさ」
　これでは如何に彼が、おやじの財産を蕩盡して、伯父さんの地所をごまかし、おばあさんの臍くりをくすねても、れい子さんなるものを陷落させることは至難である。
「――あゝ、世の中は闇である、俺ほどのいい男を空しく埋れさせて置くとは――
流石の彼も悟りをひらかざるを得なかつた。齒には齒を、眼には眼を、こゝに彼は一世一代の智謀をめぐらしたわけである。
　彼は、彼をめぐる五人の惡友と共に、意氣揚々とキャバレー丸玉の入口をくゞつた。
　御注文はかうなれば、俄かに知る金錢の有難味で、アイスコーヒー六つ、これに何時間でも囓りつこうといふ料見である。
「林檎なぞ剥きませうな」
「阿呆らしい、下痢しまんがな」
「ケーキなぞはどうだス」
「いんま晩飯を濟ましたとこや」
「うち、ソーダ水欲しいわ」
「なんなと、手錢で飲んだらえゝがな」
　彼は先づ、係りの千代子さんに冷たい戰端を開いたのである。
　平常（ふだん）に似合はぬ彼の強氣に、女給軍にセンセーションを起したのは勿論のことである。
　人間は元より天邪鬼に出来ている。で、れい子さんも、彼の意外な強氣に妙な興味が自ら湧いて来たのである。そこで番の暇を盗んで、彼等のテーブルに行つた。
「まあ、えゝもんを持つてはりまんな」
　れい子の方から口をきいたなぞは、彼が通い始めてから嘗てなかつた事であつた。
「うん、正（しや）ぼんに似合わんえゝもんや、金の鈴や、純金やで」
と五人の惡友は、れい子さんを煽りつけたのである。彼は浴衣の懷（ふところ）をひろげて、手先で一つの金色の小鈴をひけらかした。
　金の鈴は仁王様の胸元に鈴虫がとまつたように、彼の毛むくじやらの胸板の上でチリン〜と朗らかな音を立てた。
「まあ、うち欲しいわ。お呉れな」
　れい子さんの温かい柔かな掌が彼のふところに飛び込むと金の鈴を掴んだのである。れい子さんの掌の温か味が、彼の胸にはほのかに残こされ、金の鈴は朗らかな音を立てながられい子さんの指先に手ぐられて、彼のふところを離れていた。
　ところが、
　その金の鈴についている環には一本の細い紐がくりつけられて、この紐が凡そ五六尺も伸びて行つて、向も鈴と因縁は離れずに續いているのである。
「おい、あかん〜、そんなに引張りよつたら、どもならん」
　彼は鈴を引張つてゆくれい子さんを睨みながら叫んだ。
「そんなにいけず言わんと、紐解（ほど）いてくれやすな」
　れい子さんは立て込んでいるテーブルの間に立つたまゝで言つた。
　ところが、彼は、とたんに浴衣の裾から臍（へそ）の上までくるりとまくり上げて、キャバレー丸玉の建物中に響きわたる程の體（たい）声（せい）はり上げて叫んだ。
「これ、見てみい、れい子！　なんでワイの褌（ふんどし）の紐をほどくんねん、いやらしいことせんといてんか」
　れい子さんは鈴を掴んだまゝ、恥しさに顔を眞赤にして逆上しそうになつた。鈴は褌（ふんどし）の紐と續いて長く気取つた手に掴まれているのだ。
「ワテ、ほんまに、よ言わんわ」
　――おわり――

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Indeed, let [me] visit again."
In this way, no matter how much he squandered his father’s fortune, cheated [his] uncle out of land, and stole his grandmother’s secret savings, to make the person called Reiko surrender was extremely difficult.
"—Ah, the world is darkness, to let a good man like me be buried in vain—"
Even he, as expected, could not help but reach a realization. "A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye," here he had devised the scheme of a lifetime.
He, along with five bad friends surrounding him, high-spiritedly passed through the entrance of Cabaret Marutama.
As for the order, given the sudden realization of the value of money, it was six iced coffees; with these, the intention was to cling to [the table] for any number of hours.
"Shall [I] peel an apple or something?"
"Ridiculous, [I] would get diarrhea."
"How about cake or such?"
"[I] just finished dinner now."
"I (Uchi) want a soda water."
"Whatever, if [you] drink it with your own money (tezeni) it's fine, isn't it?"
He first opened a cold front of war toward the person in charge, Chiyoko-san.
His uncharacteristic aggressiveness naturally caused a sensation among the waitress army.
Humans are originally made to be perverse (amajaku). So, in Reiko-san too, a strange interest spontaneously welled up at his unexpected boldness. There, stealing a moment from her shift, she went to their table.
"My, [you] have something good there."
Reiko speaking first was something that had never happened since he started coming.
"Yeah, it’s a good thing that doesn't suit [my] nature; it's a golden bell, pure gold."
So the five bad friends egged Reiko-san on. He opened the chest of his yukata and flaunted a single small golden bell with his fingertips.
The golden bell, like a bell-cricket perched on the chest of a Nio statue, made a cheerful 'tinkle-tinkle' sound atop his hairy chest.
"My, I want it. Give it to me."
Reiko-san's warm, soft palm dove into his chest and grabbed the golden bell. The warmth of Reiko-san's palm was faintly left on his chest, and the golden bell, while making a cheerful sound, was hauled by Reiko-san's fingertips and left his chest.
However,
To the ring attached to that golden bell, a single thin string was tied, and this string extended for about five or six shaku (approx. 1.5-1.8m), and the connection between it and the bell continued without separating.
"Hey, [that's] no good, if [you] pull like that, it'll be a mess."
He shouted while glaring at Reiko-san, who was pulling the bell away.
"Don't say such mean (ikezu) things, please untie the string."
Reiko-san said while standing between the crowded tables.
However, he, at that moment, flipped up the hem of his yukata all the way to above his navel, and raised a great voice that echoed through the Cabaret Marutama building and shouted.
"Look at this, Reiko! Why are you untying my loincloth (fundoshi) string? Don't do such lewd things!"
Reiko-san, still holding the bell, turned bright red with shame and was about to fly into a rage. The bell, connected to the loincloth string, was being held in her long, affected hand.
"I (Wate), really, can't even say [anything]."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"I’ll certainly be coming back again!"
Despite squandering his father’s inheritance, swindling his uncle out of land, and pilfering his grandmother’s secret stash, the man found it nearly impossible to conquer the heart of the lovely Reiko.
"Ah, the world is truly a dark place," he lamented. "To let a fine specimen like me go to waste..."
Finally, even he had to accept the reality of his situation. Adopting the mantra "an eye for an eye," he concocted the scheme of a lifetime.
Followed by five of his rowdy companions, he swaggered through the doors of Cabaret Marutama.
When it came time to order, suddenly mindful of their dwindling funds, they decided to nurse six iced coffees for as long as humanly possible.
"Shall I peel an apple for you?" a girl asked.
"Don't be ridiculous, I'll get the runs!" he snapped.
"How about some cake?"
"I just finished dinner!"
"I'd like a soda water," one girl chimed in.
"Fine, buy it with your own damn money!"
He began his "cold war" by being uncharacteristically brusque with Chiyoko, the girl in charge. His aggressive attitude caused quite a stir among the hostesses.
Human nature is inherently perverse; the more he pushed her away, the more Reiko found herself intrigued by his sudden bravado. Stealing a moment away from her duties, she approached their table.
"My, that’s a lovely thing you’ve got there," she said. It was the first time she had ever initiated a conversation since he began frequenting the club.
"Yeah, it’s far too nice for the likes of me," he replied, as his five friends egged her on. "It’s a golden bell—pure gold."
He pulled back the front of his yukata to flaunt a small golden bell. Nestled against his hairy chest like a cricket on a temple guardian statue, the bell let out a bright *tinkle-tinkle*.
"Oh, I want it! Give it to me!" Reiko cried.
Her warm, soft hand darted into his robe and snatched the bell. He felt the lingering warmth of her palm against his skin as she drew the tinkling prize away.
But there was a catch.
Attached to the ring of the golden bell was a thin string. As Reiko backed away, the string unspooled for several feet, still tethering the bell to its source.
"Hey, stop! If you keep pulling like that, things are going to get ugly!" he shouted, glaring at her.
"Don't be so mean," Reiko pouted, standing amidst the crowded tables. "Just untie the string for me."
Suddenly, the man flipped his yukata up past his navel and let out a roar that echoed through the entire cabaret.
"Look at this, Reiko! Why are you untying my loincloth? Stop being so lewd!"
Reiko, still clutching the bell, turned scarlet with embarrassment. There she stood, in the middle of the room, realizing the bell in her hand was tied directly to his underwear.
"I... I honestly don't know what to say!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a multi-column format (four vertical columns) typical of mid-century Japanese magazines. The flow of the story starts from the top right, proceeds down that column, moves to the second column from the right, and so on.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of older kanji forms (kyu-jitai) and historical kana usage (rekishiteki kana-zukai), which was common until the orthographic reforms following WWII became fully standardized in popular media.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Top Right Illustration:** A cartoonish sketch (signed "SAN平", likely Sanpei Sato or a similar artist of that era) showing a man in a patterned robe and a woman. The man has a mischievous expression, with the onomatopoeia "イヒヒ..." (Hehehe).
    *   **Bottom Left Illustration:** A more detailed, slightly erotic sketch (signed "しげゆき" - Shigeyuki) depicting a woman in a yukata with her breasts exposed. This confirms the "ero-guro-nansensu" (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) genre popular in post-war pulp magazines.
*   **Hierarchical Structure:** The title is missing from this specific page, suggesting it might be part of a larger collection of "short-short" stories or a serialized humor column. The text includes dialogue marked with Japanese brackets (「 」).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The mention of "Cabaret Marutama" and the "waitress army" (女給軍 - jokyū-gun) points to the post-war "Kasutori" culture. These were cheap, pulp magazines printed on bad paper that focused on gossip, eroticism, and humor.
*   **Cabaret Culture:** After WWII, cabarets and "cafes" were central to Japanese nightlife. The "jokyū" (waitresses/hostesses) were often the subjects of romantic or comedic fiction.
*   **Currency and Value:** The protagonist is depicted as a "dame-otoko" (no-good man) who has squandered family wealth. The joke about ordering only iced coffee to sit for hours reflects the economic hardships and the "cheapness" of the characters.
*   **Language (Kansai Dialect):** The dialogue uses several Kansai (Osaka/Kyoto) markers like "〜まんがな" (mangāna), "〜だす" (dasu), "〜へん" (hen), and "わて" (wate). This suggests the setting is likely Osaka, the heart of comedy and cabaret culture in Japan.
*   **The "Fundoshi" Joke:** The climax relies on the *fundoshi* (traditional loincloth). In post-war humor, the transition from traditional clothing (yukata/fundoshi) to Western clothes was often used for slapstick.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **蕩盡 (Tōjin):** To squander or dissipate (wealth).
*   **臍くり (Hesokuri):** Secret savings; "pin money."
*   **天邪鬼 (Amajaku/Amanojaku):** A perverse person; someone who purposely acts contrary to expectations.
*   **手銭 (Tezeni):** One's own money; paying out of pocket.
*   **仁王様 (Niō-sama):** The fierce guardian deities found at temple gates. Used here to describe the man's hairy, rugged chest.
*   **いけず (Ikezu):** (Kansai dialect) Mean, unkind, or spiteful.
*   **五六尺 (Go-roku shaku):** Approximately 1.5 to 1.8 meters. A *shaku* is roughly 30.3 cm.
*   **褌 (Fundoshi):** Traditional Japanese male undergarment (loincloth).
*   **ワテ (Wate):** A first-person pronoun ("I") used in Kansai dialect, often by women or in a polite/affected comedic way.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Sexual Innuendo and Slapstick:** The story is a classic "dirty joke" or *shimoneta*. The "golden bell" is a literal object but serves as a prop for a public exposure gag.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The man uses a trick to regain the "upper hand" over the hostess Reiko, who had previously been dismissive of him. The "victory" is achieved through public humiliation and a prank.
*   **Post-War Nihilism:** The opening lines about the world being "darkness" and the protagonist being a failed scion of a wealthy family reflect the social instability and the breakdown of old class structures in the immediate post-war years.
*   **Ero-Guro-Nansensu:** This story perfectly fits the "Nonsense" category—it's a short, punchy, slightly lewd comedic piece designed for quick entertainment.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Humor (Gesaku).
*   **Genre:** Ero-guro-nansensu, Pulp fiction.
*   **Themes:** Nightlife, Cabaret, Deception, Pranks, Sexuality, Kansai Dialect.
