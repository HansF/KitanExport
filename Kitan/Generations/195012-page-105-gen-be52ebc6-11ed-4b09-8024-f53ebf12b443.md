## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

　カンボテが懐中電燈を照らしてスイッチを探し、パツと灯をつけた。雑然とした廣い女達の化粧部屋であつた。鏡台の前に女がひとり座つており、さつきマリアームを突き出したでつぷりした男が凄い顔をして部屋の隅つこの椅子にかけながら莨を吸つていた。にわかにこういう態度をとつたんだな、とカンボテは思つた。
「おいツ！この奥さんの亭主をどこへかくしたツ」
「知りませぬぜ」
　男は平然として応えた。カマキリのポリーシーは拳銃をひよい――弄びながら女の傍へゆき、顔を覗きこんだ。
「へえへ、別嬪ぢやねえか、おや？」
　そういつて彼は床板に眼を落し
「あツ、血、血だツ！」
「なにツ？」
　カンボテが慌てゝ飛んできた。点々と血が落ちている。二人は屈みこんで血の跡を辿つて開け放たれた窓際まで交した。男も女もぎよつとして眼を見交した。マリアームは部屋の隅つこで蒼白になつた。
　カンボテは窓から身を乗り出して懐中電燈を照らした。
　裏は海岸ですうとアンボン港に連なつていた。満潮で床下までひた／＼と水が押し寄せている。
「いやすッ？何か白いものが浮いているぞてめえ拾つてこい、淺いんだから」
「へえ」
　カマキリのポリーシーは靴を脱いで窓から飛び降りた。
「トアン、男の服ですぜ」
　そんな声がして、やがて、窓枠につかまつて入つてきた。白い木綿の背廣が上下、しずくだつているのをぶら下げている。
　マリアームは、傍へ駆けつけ、それを見るなり
「あツ、夫のだわ」
　そういつて手にとりと、鏡台の前に座つて、さつきから隙を窺つていたらしい女が、さつと立上つて逃げ出そうとした。申合わせたように、でつぷりした男もドアに向つて駆け出した。
「待てツ！動くと撃つぞッ！」
　カマキリのポリーシーが拳銃をさし向けた。
　二人は、ぴたりと立竦んだ。
「ひつくゝつてしまえツ！」
　カンボテが叫んだので、カマキリのポリーシーは二人の前へ近附いてゆき、手際よく、ガチャ／＼と二人に手錠をはめてしまつた。
　濡れた服のポケツトからは、見覚えのある夫のハンカチだの、莨のケースなどが続々と出てきたが財布がなかつた。
　カンボテは、室内をくまなく探したすると、女が使つていた鏡台の下から出てきた。鰐皮の大きな財布だつたが開けてみると金が一文もなかつた。小さな箱がひとつ入つていた。中味は純金の耳飾りであつた。
「あらツ、これは、家を出るとき、夫が買つてきてやるといつてたんですわああ、あなたツ――」
　彼女は耳飾りを手にして切なげに叫んだ。手錠をはめられている女の眼がそのとき、なぜかキラリと光つた。
「やつぱし、あたしのことを思つていてくれたんだわ――ね、トアン、夫は殺されたんでしようか？」
「そうかも知れねえ、殺して、金を奪い、証拠になるものを海へ捨てたに違いねえ。さあ、大変だ、夜が明けたら死体を探さにやならん」
「おお――あなたツ――」
　マリアームは、耳飾りを胸に抱きしめて泣いた。
「やい＼／ツ、手前等、金をとつてバラしやがつたんだろツ！さあ、自白しろいッ！」
　カンボテは大蛸のように唇を尖らして叫んだ。それでも応えがないので十三文のドタ靴で床がへし折れるほど地團太を踏んだ。が彼等はふてくされている。女は、非常に厚化粧をしていたが、細面の中々の美人で俯向いたまゝ、ぶる／＼震えていた。
「しぶてえ野郎だなツ、おいツ！いわねえかッ！」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Kanbote flashlight shined, switch searched, and with a "pat" light turned on. It was a cluttered large women's dressing room. In front of the dressing table, one woman was sitting, and the plump man who earlier pushed out Mariarm, with a terrible face, was sitting in a chair in the corner of the room smoking tobacco. Suddenly taking such an attitude, Kanbote thought.
"Hey! Where did you hide this lady's husband!"
"I don't know," the man calmly replied.
Kamakiri the Policy (nickname), while lightly—fiddling with a pistol, went to the woman's side and peered into her face.
"Heh, isn't she a beauty? Oh?"
Saying that, he dropped his eyes to the floorboards.
"Ah, blood, it's blood!"
"What?"
Kanbote came flying in a hurry. Dots of blood were falling. The two crouched down and followed the trail of blood to the wide-open window. The man and woman both looked at each other with a start. Mariarm turned pale in the corner of the room.
Kanbote leaned out the window and shined the flashlight.
The back was the seashore, leading smoothly to Ambon Port. At high tide, water was lapping right up to under the floorboards.
"Wait? Something white is floating. You, go pick it up, it's shallow."
"Yes."
Kamakiri the Policy took off his shoes and jumped out the window.
"Tuan, it's a man's clothes."
Such a voice was heard, and soon, he came in gripping the window frame. He was dangling a set of white cotton suit clothes, dripping wet.
Mariarm rushed to the side, and as soon as she saw it,
"Ah, it's my husband's."
Saying that and taking it in hand, the woman who had been sitting in front of the dressing table, seemingly watching for an opening, suddenly stood up and tried to flee. As if by agreement, the plump man also rushed toward the door.
"Wait! Move and I shoot!"
Kamakiri the Policy pointed the pistol.
The two stood frozen still.
"Tie them up!"
Because Kanbote shouted, Kamakiri the Policy approached the front of the two, and skillfully, with a "clink clink," put handcuffs on the two of them.
From the pockets of the wet clothes, things like the husband's familiar handkerchief and tobacco case came out one after another, but there was no wallet.
Kanbote searched the room thoroughly. Then, it came out from under the dressing table the woman was using. It was a large crocodile skin wallet, but when opened, there was not a single cent of money. One small box was inside. The content was pure gold earrings.
"Oh, this, when leaving home, my husband said he would buy it for me. Oh, darling—"
She cried out painfully, holding the earrings. The eye of the woman who was handcuffed, at that moment, for some reason flashed.
"After all, he was thinking of me... Say, Tuan, was my husband killed?"
"That might be so. Killed him, snatched the money, and threw the evidence into the sea, no doubt. Now, this is serious, when dawn breaks, we'll have to search for the corpse."
"Oh... darling—"
Mariarm embraced the earrings to her chest and wept.
"Hey, hey, you lot, you took the money and bumped him off, didn't you! Come on, confess!"
Kanbote, like a giant octopus, pursed his lips and shouted. Even so, there was no reply, so with his size-thirteen heavy boots, he stamped his feet so hard the floor nearly snapped. But they remained defiant. The woman had very heavy makeup, but was a slender-faced considerable beauty, and remained looking down, trembling.
"Stubborn bastards, hey! Won't you talk!?"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Kanbote flicked on his flashlight and found the switch, bathing the room in light. It was a sprawling, cluttered ladies' dressing room. A woman sat before the vanity, while the portly man who had earlier shoved Mariarm aside sat in a corner chair, a grim expression on his face as he puffed on a cigarette. *Trying to look innocent now, are we?* Kanbote thought.

"Hey! Where the hell did you hide this lady’s husband?"

"I haven’t the faintest idea," the man replied, cool as a cucumber.

The man nicknamed Kamakiri—the "Policy"—went over to the woman, casually twirling his pistol before leaning in to peer at her face. "Well, well, aren't you a looker? Oh?" 

His gaze dropped to the floorboards. "Ah! Blood! It’s blood!"

"What?" Kanbote rushed over. A trail of blood droplets led across the floor to the open window. The suspect man and woman exchanged a sharp, startled look. In the corner, Mariarm turned deathly pale.

Kanbote leaned out the window, sweeping his light across the darkness. The house sat right on the shore, the water of Ambon Port stretching out behind it. The tide was in, and the water lapped rhythmically against the pilings beneath the floor.

"Wait a second... there’s something white floating down there. You! Jump down and get it. It’s shallow."

"Right," Policy muttered. He kicked off his shoes and vaulted out the window.

"Tuan, it’s a man’s suit!" his voice called out. A moment later, he hauled himself back over the sill, clutching a soaking wet white cotton suit.

Mariarm ran to him. The moment she saw the clothes, she cried out, "Oh! It’s my husband’s!"

As she took the sodden fabric, the woman at the vanity—who had been watching for her moment—suddenly bolted. At the same instant, the fat man made a break for the door.

"Freeze! Move and I'll blow your heads off!" Policy leveled his gun at them. Both suspects stopped dead in their tracks.

"Cuff 'em!" Kanbote barked. Policy stepped forward and expertly snapped the irons onto their wrists with a sharp metallic *clack*.

A search of the wet pockets turned up the husband’s handkerchief and his cigarette case, but no wallet. Kanbote tore the room apart until he found it hidden beneath the vanity. It was a large crocodile-skin wallet, but it was empty of cash. Inside was only a small box containing a pair of solid gold earrings.

"Oh... these," Mariarm sobbed, clutching the jewelry. "He told me he’d buy these for me before he left home. Oh, my darling..." 

She wailed in grief. At that moment, the eyes of the handcuffed woman flashed with a strange, inexplicable glint.

"He really was thinking of me... Tuan, do you think he’s been murdered?"

"It looks that way," Kanbote said grimly. "They likely killed him for the cash and tossed the evidence into the harbor. This is a mess. We’ll have to dredge for the body come daybreak."

"Oh, my love!" Mariarm collapsed, hugging the earrings to her chest.

"Listen up, you scum! You killed him for the money, didn't you? Start talking!" Kanbote shouted, his lips pursing like an angry octopus. When they didn't answer, he slammed his heavy, oversized boots onto the floorboards with enough force to crack the wood. The suspects remained sullen. The woman, despite her heavy mask of makeup, was quite a beauty, but she kept her head bowed, trembling violently.

"Stubborn bastards! Are you going to talk or not!?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in a traditional vertical Japanese format (tategaki), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. The use of the small "tsu" (ッ) at the end of dialogue is a stylistic choice typical of "hard-boiled" or action-oriented fiction of the era to denote a sharp, glottal stop or forceful tone.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "(106)" is centered at the bottom. The illustration is integrated into the text block on the lower right, creating a wrap-around effect.
*   **Illustration:** The artwork by "Mihira" (三平) shows a man in a striped shirt and a brimmed hat—typical "tough guy" or "criminal" attire of the 1940s/50s. The art style is sketchy and expressive, characteristic of pulp magazine "sashi-e" (insert illustrations).
*   **Punctuation:** Includes traditional Japanese quotation marks (「 」) and repetition marks (々). Some archaic kana usage like "ぢ" instead of "じ" and "あつた" instead of "あった" points to a pre-1946 orthography or a transitional post-war style.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s to early 1950s. The setting of "Ambon Port" (Indonesia) suggests the "Nan'yo" (South Seas) subgenre. During and after WWII, Japanese stories often featured Southeast Asian locales, reflecting Japan's wartime expansion and the lingering exoticism of the region.
*   **Terminology:** 
    *   **Tuan (トアン):** A Malay/Indonesian word for "Sir" or "Master." Its use here indicates the colonial or post-colonial Southeast Asian setting.
    *   **Ambon (アンボン):** A city and port in the Moluccas, Indonesia.
    *   **Thirteen-mon boots (十三文のドタ靴):** "Mon" is an old unit of length (approx. 2.4cm). 13 mon is about 31cm (a very large foot size), used here to emphasize Kanbote's imposing or comical physical presence.
*   **Social Context:** The story reflects "Kasutori" culture—the era of cheap, sensationalist pulp magazines that flourished in the ruins of post-war Japan, focusing on crime, mystery, and western-influenced "hard-boiled" tropes.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **別嬪 (Beppin):** A beautiful woman. An older, somewhat slangy term still used today but very common in the Showa era.
*   **亭主 (Teishu):** Husband. Can sound slightly informal or old-fashioned depending on context.
*   **屈みこんで (Kagamikonde):** Crouching down.
*   **蒼白 (Sōhaku):** Pale; ghastly white from shock or fear.
*   **地團太を踏む (Jidanda o fumu):** To stamp one's feet in frustration or anger.
*   **バラす (Barasu):** Slang for "to kill" or "to take apart." In this context, it means murder.
*   **しぶとい (Shibutoi):** Stubborn, tenacious, or "tough nut to crack."

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Hard-boiled Justice:** The characters Kanbote and "Policy" Kamakiri represent a rough-and-tumble detective duo. They use intimidation and firearms, fitting the "machi-ben" or hard-boiled detective archetype.
*   **Tragedy and Greed:** The contrast between the "pure gold earrings" (a symbol of the husband's love) and the "empty crocodile wallet" (a symbol of the killers' greed) highlights the emotional weight of the crime.
*   **Exoticism:** The mention of Ambon and "Tuan" adds a layer of adventure and "otherness" for a Japanese audience of the time, who viewed the South Seas as a place of both danger and mystery.
*   **Gender Roles:** The "damsel in distress" (Mariarm) versus the "femme fatale" (the beautiful, heavily-made-up suspect) is a classic noir trope.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Mystery/Crime.
*   **Tags:** Hard-boiled, Noir, Post-war Japan, South Seas Adventure (Nan'yo), Murder Mystery, Detective Fiction.
*   **Classification:** Entertainment / Pulp Fiction.
