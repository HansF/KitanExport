**閨房殺人事件**
**杉山清道**

「もしもし、青空晴子さんいらつしやいませんか？河原町の稲本ですがすぐ来（き）て頂けませんか、うちの女給が強姦された上に絞殺されたのです。えゝ……えゝ、そうなんです。男の方より事件が事件だけに、晴子さんの方がいいと思うものですから――」

寶塚少女歌劇から京都レコードに轉向し、更に女流探偵に豹變した、可愛い美貌とスイートな唄聲で知られている純情乙女。僕らの晴子さんが愈々登場。彼女と二人の刑事と警察醫とがこの貸座敷「新月」の二階へ到着したのは、それから二十分も經たない後の事だつた。
すぐ醫師が型通りの検屍を終えると、晴子はさすがに女らしい思いやりで羞（はづか）しい富子の腰の邊りへそつと白布を掛けてやつた。それからすぐに事件關係者は隣室へ集められ、犯罪捜査は始まつた。又丁度停電時で、點された蠟燭の火の下に集つている皆の緊張した顔に、ゆらゆらと複雑な陰影が踊つて、何かしら凄惨な鬼氣が肌を走るように思われた。晴子は簡単に事件内容を聴取すると、次のような箇條を頭の中で纒めてみた。

一、犯行當時「新月」に居たのは佐崎君と西山君、女給詩子と被害者富子。それにこの家の女主人の五人。
二、西山君は富子を裸体にした上、彼女の首に巻付いている紐で富子の身体を鞭打し（儀式によつても歴然）、さんざん弄んだ揚句に目的を遂げ、洋服を着て「ひなどり」へ帰つた事。尚その變態痴行中に富子は何度でも殺してくれと絶叫した事を佐崎が證言した。
三、佐崎は詩子との語らいを終えると、暫くしてからひなどりへ帰つたが、その時まだ富子は室に居たらしい事。
四、詩子は佐崎を送り出してから着物を着て化粧を直した。それから一度便所へ行つてからひなどりへ帰る時には、富子は暗くて着物が分らないとその室で言つていたから、その時はまだ彼女は確かに生きていた事。
五、「新月」を去つた順序は第一佐崎、第二西山、第三、詩子の順らしい事。

刑事の一人は皆をジロツと見廻してから、鋭い語調でこう言つた。
「島田富子を姦淫した男と、絞殺した男とは同一人物と見てよいと思う。又被害者の股間に認められる汚液や、前後の事情などからして、これは西山保夫を犯人だと推定する」
それを聞くや否や、彼は顔色を変えて立ち上り、刑事を睨みつけながら昂奮した聲で叫んだ。
「違う、違う！俺が何故富子を殺さねばならないのだ！俺は富子と結婚を誓つた男、俺は、俺は富子をこんな事にした奴をこそ殺してやりたい位だ！それに第一最後に新月を出た詩子さんが富子の生存を確認してるのに、それより先に帰つた俺が何故どうし…」

「もしもし、青空晴子さんいらっしゃいませんか？河原町の稲本ですがすぐ来ていただけませんか、うちの女給が強姦された上に絞殺されたのです。ええ……ええ、そうなんです。男の方より事件が事件だけに、晴子さんの方がいいと思うものですから――」

宝塚少女歌劇から京都レコードに転向し、さらに女流探偵に豹変した、可愛い美貌とスイートな歌声で知られている純情乙女。僕らの晴子さんがいよいよ登場。彼女と二人の刑事と警察医とがこの貸座敷「新月」の二階へ到着したのは、それから二十分も経たない後のことだった。
すぐ医師が型通りの検視を終えると、晴子はさすがに女らしい思いやりで恥ずかしい富子の腰のあたりへそっと白布を掛けてやった。それからすぐに事件関係者は隣室へ集められ、犯罪捜査は始まった。またちょうど停電時で、点された蝋燭の火の下に集まっている皆の緊張した顔に、ゆらゆらと複雑な陰影が踊って、何かしら凄惨な鬼気が肌を走るように思われた。晴子は簡単に事件内容を聴取すると、次のような箇条を頭の中でまとめてみた。

二、西山君は富子を裸体にした上、彼女の首に巻き付いている紐で富子の身体を鞭打ち（儀式によっても歴然）、さんざん弄んだ挙げ句に目的を遂げ、洋服を着て「ひなどり」へ帰ったこと。なおその変態痴行中に富子は何度でも殺してくれと絶叫したことを佐崎が証言した。

刑事の一人は皆をジロリと見回してから、鋭い語調でこう言った。
「島田富子を姦淫した男と、絞殺した男とは同一人物と見てよいと思う。また被害者の股間に認められる汚液や、前後の事情などからして、これは西山保夫を犯人だと推定する」
それを聞くやいなや、彼は顔色を変えて立ち上がり、刑事を睨みつけながら興奮した声で叫んだ。
「違う、違う！俺がなぜ富子を殺さねばならないのだ！俺は富子と結婚を誓った男、俺は、俺は富子をこんなことにした奴をこそ殺してやりたいくらいだ！それに第一最後に新月を出た詩子さんが富子の生存を確認してるのに、それより先に帰った俺がなぜどうし……」

**Bedroom Murder Case**
**Sugiyama Seidō**

"Hello, is Miss Haruko Aozora there? This is Inamoto from Kawaramachi, but could you please come immediately? A waitress of ours was raped and moreover strangled to death. Yes... yes, that is so. Rather than a man, since the incident is what it is, I thought Miss Haruko would be better—"

Having converted from Takarazuka Girls' Opera to Kyoto Records, and further having suddenly transformed into a female detective, the pure maiden known for her cute beauty and sweet singing voice. Our Haruko-san finally appears. The time she, two detectives, and a police doctor arrived at the second floor of this rental room "Shin-getsu" (New Moon) was not even twenty minutes after that.
As soon as the doctor finished the routine autopsy, Haruko, with expected womanly consideration, softly draped a white cloth over the waist area of the shameful Tomiko. Immediately after that, the people involved in the case were gathered in the next room, and the criminal investigation began. Also, because it was exactly during a power outage, on the tense faces of everyone gathered under the light of lit candles, complex shadows danced unsteadily, and it seemed as if some gruesome ghastly spirit was running across one's skin. Haruko, after briefly hearing the details of the incident, tried summarizing the following points in her head.

1. Those in "Shin-getsu" at the time of the crime were Mr. Sazaki, Mr. Nishiyama, the waitress Utako, and the victim Tomiko. Plus the landlady of this house, five people.
2. Mr. Nishiyama made Tomiko naked, and after whipping Tomiko's body with the cord wrapped around her neck (evident from the ritual), after playing with her extensively he achieved his goal, put on his suit, and returned to "Hinadori." Furthermore, during that perverted act, Sazaki testified that Tomiko screamed "Kill me!" many times.
3. Sazaki, after finishing his talk with Utako, returned to "Hinadori" after a while, but at that time Tomiko seemingly was still in the room.
4. Utako, after seeing Sazaki off, put on her kimono and fixed her makeup. Then, after going to the toilet once, when returning to "Hinadori," because Tomiko said in that room that it was dark and she couldn't see her kimono, at that time she was certainly still alive.
5. The order of leaving "Shin-getsu" seems to be first Sazaki, second Nishiyama, third Utako.

One of the detectives, after glancing around at everyone, spoke in a sharp tone like this.
"I think it is fine to see the man who raped Tomiko Shimada and the man who strangled her as the same person. Also, from the stains observed in the victim's crotch and the circumstances before and after, I presume Nishiyama Yasuo is the culprit."
As soon as he heard that, his face changed color and he stood up, shouting in an excited voice while glaring at the detective.
"Wrong, wrong! Why must I kill Tomiko! I am the man who swore marriage to Tomiko! I... I want to kill the guy who did this to Tomiko! And besides, even though Utako-san, who left Shingetsu last, confirmed Tomiko's survival, why would I, who went home before her, how..."

**The Bedroom Murder Case**
**By Sugiyama Seidō**

"Hello? Is Miss Haruko Aozora in? This is Inamoto from Kawaramachi. Could you come at once? One of our girls has been violated and strangled. Yes... yes, that’s right. Given the nature of the crime, I felt a woman’s touch—specifically Haruko’s—would be more appropriate than a man’s."

Once a star of the Takarazuka Revue who moved on to Kyoto Records, she has now undergone a startling transformation into a lady detective. Known for her darling looks and a singing voice as sweet as honey, she is the "pure maiden" of our hearts. Our dear Haruko finally makes her entrance. It was less than twenty minutes after the frantic call that she, accompanied by two detectives and a forensic pathologist, arrived at the second floor of the "Shin-getsu" lodging house.
The doctor performed a perfunctory examination. With a woman’s innate sensitivity, Haruko gently draped a white sheet over the victim, Tomiko, to cover her exposed lower body. The witnesses were promptly ushered into the adjoining room to begin the interrogation. A blackout had struck the neighborhood; in the flickering glow of candlelight, shifting shadows danced across the strained faces of the suspects, lending the air a gruesome, spectral chill that made the skin crawl. Haruko listened to the initial reports and began mentally cataloging the facts:

1. Five people were present at Shin-getsu during the crime: Sazaki, Nishiyama, the waitress Utako, the victim Tomiko, and the landlady.
2. Nishiyama stripped Tomiko naked and whipped her body with the very cord later found around her neck—a ritualistic act of cruelty. After sating his perverse desires, he dressed and returned to the "Hinadori" club. Sazaki testified that during the assault, Tomiko was heard screaming, "Kill me! Just kill me!"
3. Sazaki left for Hinadori shortly after finishing a conversation with Utako. According to him, Tomiko was still alive in the room at that point.
4. After seeing Sazaki off, Utako redressed and reapplied her makeup. She went to the restroom and then prepared to leave for Hinadori. She claims she heard Tomiko speak from the dark room, complaining she couldn't find her kimono, which would confirm she was alive when Utako left.
5. The departure sequence appears to be Sazaki first, then Nishiyama, and finally Utako.

One of the detectives swept his gaze over the group and barked, "We are operating on the assumption that the man who raped Tomiko Shimada and the man who strangled her are one and the same. Based on the physical evidence found on the victim and the timeline of events, I am placing Nishiyama Yasuo under arrest."
Upon hearing this, Nishiyama’s face turned deathly pale. He leaped to his feet, glaring at the officer. "No! That's a lie!" he screamed. "Why would I kill Tomiko? We were engaged to be married! I want to kill the bastard who did this to her myself! Besides, Utako was the last one out, and she said Tomiko was alive then! How could I have done it if I left before her?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Visual Hierarchy:** The page is dominated by a large, stylized title at the top right ("閨房殺人事件"). Below the title is the author's name. An illustration of a semi-nude female corpse takes up a significant portion of the right side, a hallmark of the *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque) genre of the era.
*   **Typography:** The text is set in a traditional vertical orientation (tategaki). It uses a standard Mincho typeface typical of mid-century magazines.
*   **Structure:** The story begins with a snippet of dialogue in a box (likely a "teaser" or the very start of the scene), followed by a descriptive introductory paragraph for the protagonist, Haruko Aozora. The middle section uses a numbered list to summarize the "clues," a common trope in detective fiction to engage the reader in the mystery.
*   **Illustration:** The artwork is provocative, emphasizing the "shameful" (as the text calls it) state of the victim, which was a common selling point for pulp magazines of the 1940s and 50s. The man's head peering from the top adds a voyeuristic or menacing element.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** This text likely dates from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, the "Kasutori" magazine era. These were cheap, sensationalist publications that flourished in post-war Japan, focusing on pulp fiction, scandal, and eroticism.
*   **Takarazuka & Kyoto Records:** The protagonist is described as a former Takarazuka "Otome" (maiden). The Takarazuka Revue was (and is) a prestigious all-female theater troupe. Her background as a singer and actress turned detective reflects the "Modern Girl" (Moga) archetype—independent and career-oriented.
*   **Kashizashiki (貸座敷):** These were "rental rooms" or "assignation houses." In the post-war period, they often functioned as unlicensed brothels or places for clandestine trysts.
*   **Post-War Hardship:** The mention of a "power outage" (停電 - teiden) was a common reality in post-war Japan due to infrastructure damage and coal shortages, often used in literature to create a moody, noir atmosphere.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **閨房 (Keibō):** Literally "bedroom" or "boudoir." It carries a strong connotation of intimacy and sexuality.
*   **女給 (Jokyū):** A waitress, often specifically referring to those in cafes or bars who provided conversation and sometimes sexual services in the early-to-mid 20th century.
*   **豹變 (Hyōhen):** To change suddenly and drastically. Originally meaning "to change for the better" (like a leopard's spots becoming distinct), in modern/pulp usage, it often just means a startling transformation.
*   **変態痴行 (Hentai chikō):** Perverted/lewd behavior. "Hentai" here is used in its original sense of "abnormality" or "perversion."
*   **鬼氣 (Kiki):** A ghastly or eerie atmosphere; literally "demon spirit."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** The text leans heavily into the "Erotic Grotesque" tradition, blending a violent murder with descriptions of nudity, whipping, and "perverted acts."
*   **The Gender of Justice:** The introduction explicitly notes that because the victim is a woman and the crime is sexual, a "female detective" is more appropriate. This justifies the presence of a "pure maiden" in a sordid crime scene, a common way to balance titillation with a "moral" protagonist.
*   **Class and Urban Vice:** The setting of Kawaramachi (a famous district in Kyoto) and the mention of rental houses and "waitresses" paint a picture of the urban "water trade" (mizu shōbai) and the perceived lawlessness of the post-war city.
*   **The Mystery Trope:** The use of a numbered list of suspects and timings is a direct nod to the "honkaku" (orthodox) detective style, inviting the reader to play along with the detective.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Mystery, Short Story.
*   **Genre:** Detective Fiction (Kyōfu/Tantei), Ero-Guro.
