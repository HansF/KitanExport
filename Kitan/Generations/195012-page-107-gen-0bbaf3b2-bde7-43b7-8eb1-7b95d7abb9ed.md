## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

望んでもおまえが到底許してくれないだろうから――。
　マリアームは、それを讀むと声をあげて泣いた。貯金通帳は二人が結婚した日から毎月確実に預入れられており、最後は殺された日になつていた。
「あゝ、あたしのために、こんなに思つていてくれたのに――あなたッ！　疑つていたあたしを許してちようだい！」
　彼女は、泣きながら警察へ駆け行つた。折よくカンボテがいた。彼はむさぼるように手紙を讀んだが
「おや？　日附は昨日だ、いよ〜奇妙キテレツになつてきやがつたて――僞筆ぢやねえかな――？」
「そんなことゼツタイにありませんわあのひとの筆蹟はよく知つておりますから」
　カンボテはどたまがぶち割れるほど考えた。誰に頼んで誰がマリアームの家へ何時頃抛りこんだかも分らないし、字体が本人のだとすると彼は今どこにケツカルのか、勇気を出せば生きてまた会えるかもしれない――
　かもしれないとはどういうことぢや自分は元のようにおまえと一緒に暮すことはできぬだろう――
　とはいつたいなんぢや。カフェービンタンマラムの何処かの一室に幽閉されて人相が変るほど惨虐な目に会つているのか？　マリアームが恐れて逃げ出すようなむごたらしい面になりさらしなのかな。そんなそうで、手紙はどうして書きさらしたんぢや、うん？　白粉の匂いがするぞ？　ヘッ、嘘八百を並べてて色女を抱いてケツカルんぢやねえか。すると、豚箱に入つてる奴はいったい何をさらした事になるんぢやろう？？――。
「おお――神様、あのひとをお救い下さいませ、ああ、愛しいあなた――」
　マリアームは、カンボテが、気狂いになるほど考えているのも知らずに、傍で、おい〜泣きながらうるさく神様を拝み続けた。

　　　四
　カンボテを頼つてはラチがあかないので、その夜、マリアームは念入りに化粧をし、ネッカチーフで顔を包んで家を出た。
　夫は生きているに違いないのだ。たとえどんな姿に変つていようと、会いたいし、できれば救い出してやりたい。
　そう思つてカフェービンタン・マラムに向つて三輪車を飛ばした
　やがて、誰ひとり不審に思うものもなく易々とホールに入ると、まず気分を落着けるためにアンゴール（葡萄酒）を註文した。
　室内は丁香（香料の一種）臭い莨の煙と、にがつぽい南方女特有の体臭でむん〜している。バンドが止むと踊りに興奮した男男女女がそろ〜席に帰つてきた。
　その時、ゴツ〜に糊のきいた背廣を着たひょろ長い男が、河馬に衣裳を着せたようなでかい女と手を組んでドサリ、ヒョロリとやつてきたが、ふとマリアームをみて眼の色を変え、つか〜と寄つてきた。
　マリアームはぎよツとした。顔をかくす間もなかつた。
「奥さん、とう〜きましたね、フフ」
　彼女はハツとして顔をあげた。
「あらッ！」
　嬉しや、カマキリのポリシーではないかいか、鼻の下につけ髭をしてチャップリンみたいな顔でにや〜しているから分らないので。
「シツ！　さとられたらイノチが危ねえですからな、それに、フフ、フフ、カンボテもきていますぜ」
　そういつて、カマキリは、傍のでかい女の腰を突ついた。女は、恥かしそうに顔をかくして偉大なお尻を向けていたが、驚いて、振りかえり、掌で半顔をかくしてヒヒと笑つた。マリアームはひと目みて、思わず吹出してしまつた。
　ポリシーのカンボテが女装している。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Even if I wish for it, because you likely will not forgive me at all—."
Mariam, when [she] read that, raised [her] voice and cried. The savings passbook, from the day the two married, every month certainly had been deposited into, and the last [entry] had become the day [he] was killed.
"Ah, for my sake, even though [you] thought [of me] this much—darling! Please forgive me who was doubting [you]!"
She, while crying, ran to the police. Fortunately, Kanbote was there. He read the letter as if devouring it, but:
"Oh? The date is yesterday. More and more it has become strange-kiteretsu—might it be a forged hand—?"
"Such a thing absolutely is not [possible], because I know that person's handwriting well."
Kanbote thought so much his head felt like it would burst. Who was asked, who threw [the letter] into Mariam’s house at what time, [he] doesn't know, and if the font/handwriting is the person himself's, where is he currently existing/staying? If one shows courage, [one] might be able to live and meet again—
"Might be able to" — what does that mean? "I, as before, probably will not be able to live together with you" —
What on earth is that? In some room of Cafe Bintang Malam, is [he] being confined and meeting with such cruel treatment that his appearance changes? Did he become such a gruesome face that Mariam would fear and run away? If that is so, how did [he] write out the letter? Hmm? There is the smell of face powder? Heh, isn't [he] lining up eight hundred lies and embracing a loose woman? Then, the fellow who is in the pig-box, what on earth did [he] expose/do?
"Oh, God, please save that person. Ah, dear you—"
Mariam, without knowing that Kanbote was thinking to the point of going crazy, at the side, while crying "oi-oi," loudly continued to pray to God.

IV
Because relying on Kanbote would lead nowhere, that night, Mariam carefully applied makeup, wrapped [her] face in a neckerchief, and left the house.
The husband must be alive without a doubt. Even if [he] has changed into whatever appearance, [she] wants to meet, and if possible, wants to rescue [him].
Thinking so, [she] sped a three-wheeled vehicle toward Cafe Bintang Malam.
Before long, without a single person thinking [it] suspicious, easily entering the hall, first, to settle her mood, [she] ordered Angor (wine).
The interior is "mun-mun" (steaming/stuffing) with the smell of clove (a type of spice) tobacco smoke and the bitter body odor characteristic of Southern women. When the band stopped, the men and women excited by dancing returned "zoro-zoro" (in a line) to their seats.
At that time, a lanky man wearing a stiffly starched suit came "dosari, hyorori" (thudding/staggering) while linking arms with a huge woman who looked like a hippo dressed in clothes, but suddenly looking at Mariam, changed the color of his eyes and came "tsuka-tsuka" (briskly) closer.
Mariam was startled. There was no time to hide her face.
"Madam, finally you came, fufu."
She gave a "ha" and raised her face.
"Ara!"
Joyful, is it not the "Mantis" Policeman? Because [he] has a fake mustache under his nose and is "niya-niya" (grinning) with a face like Chaplin, [she] did not recognize [him].
"Shh! If it is realized, life is in danger. Besides, fufu, fufu, Kanbote is also here."
Saying so, Mantis poked the waist of the huge woman at his side. The woman, looking embarrassed, hid her face and turned her great buttocks, but surprised, turned around and hiding half her face with her palm, laughed "hi-hi." Mariam, seeing with one look, unintentionally burst out laughing.
The Policeman Kanbote is cross-dressing as a woman.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Since I know that no matter how much I might wish for it, you could never find it in your heart to forgive me..."

Upon reading those words, Mariam broke down in loud sobs. The savings passbook showed steady monthly deposits starting from the very day of their marriage; the final entry was dated the day her husband was supposedly killed.

"Oh, darling! You were thinking of me all this time, and yet I... I doubted you! Please, forgive me!"

Weeping, she rushed to the police station. As luck would have it, Kanbote was there. He devoured the letter with his eyes, but a frown creased his brow.

"Hmm? This is dated yesterday. This is getting stranger and stranger... kiteretsu, I’d say. You sure this isn't a forgery?"

"Absolutely not! I know his handwriting better than anyone’s."

Kanbote thought so hard his head felt like it might split. He had no idea who had been hired to toss the letter into Mariam’s house or when it happened. But if the handwriting really was the husband's, where on earth was the man hiding? If they could find the courage, perhaps they could meet again.

But what did that phrase mean—*"I probably won't be able to live with you as we did before"*? What could that possibly imply? Was he being held captive in some back room of the Cafe Bintang Malam, being tortured so brutally his own face had been disfigured? Had he become so hideous that Mariam would flee in terror at the sight of him? If so, how did he manage to write the letter? 

Wait... was that the scent of face powder on the paper? *Heh,* Kanbote thought, *maybe the guy is just spinning a web of lies while he dallies with some mistress.* But then, what about the fellow they already had locked up in the pig-box?

"Oh, God, please save him! Oh, my dearest..." 

Mariam, oblivious to the fact that Kanbote was racking his brains to the point of madness, knelt nearby, wailing and pestering the heavens with her prayers.

**IV**

Realizing that relying on Kanbote was getting her nowhere, Mariam took matters into her own hands that night. She applied her makeup with extra care, wrapped a neckerchief around her head to conceal her features, and slipped out of the house. 

Her husband had to be alive. No matter how much he might have changed, she had to see him—and rescue him if she could. With that resolve, she hailed a motorized tricycle and sped toward the Cafe Bintang Malam.

She slipped into the dance hall with ease, drawing no suspicious glances. To steady her nerves, she first ordered a glass of Angor wine. The air in the room was thick and stifling, heavy with the scent of clove-scented tobacco and the sharp, bitter musk of the local "Southern" women. When the band stopped playing, the dancers, still flushed with excitement, began drifting back to their tables.

It was then that a lanky man in a stiff, oversized suit came staggering over, arm-in-arm with a massive woman who looked like a hippopotamus in a dress. The man’s eyes locked onto Mariam; his expression shifted instantly, and he marched straight toward her.

Mariam froze. There was no time to hide.

"Well, Madam, you finally showed up, didn't you? Heh heh."

Startled, she looked up. "Oh!"

To her immense relief, it was "The Mantis," the local policeman. He was wearing a fake mustache and grinning like Charlie Chaplin, which was why she hadn't recognized him at first.

"Shh! Keep it down or we’re both dead. Besides," he chuckled, "Kanbote is here, too."

The Mantis nudged the waist of the giant woman at his side. The woman had been coyly hiding her face and presenting her enormous backside to the room, but at the nudge, she spun around with a startled "He-he!" laugh, shielding half her face with her hand. 

Mariam took one look and burst into laughter. There was Kanbote, the policeman, dressed in full drag.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). It consists of three columns of text. The first column concludes a scene, and the Roman numeral "四" (4) marks the beginning of a new chapter or section.
*   **Typography:** The typeface is a standard Mincho style common in mid-century printing. It uses historical kana orthography (e.g., "ぢ" for "じ", "ゐ" for "い"). There is frequent use of iteration marks (like "〜" or "々") to indicate repeated sounds (e.g., "とう〜" for "とうとう", "むん〜" for "むんむん").
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The section break is clearly indicated by the numeral "四" placed centrally. The bottom of the page contains the page number "(108)" and the author/illustrator credits: "三少" (Sanshō - likely a pseudonym) and "絵" (Picture).
*   **Illustration:** The central illustration is a woodblock-style or ink-wash sketch depicting three characters. The woman on the left (Mariam) looks shocked. The man in the center (The Mantis) wears a suit and a "Chaplin" mustache. The large figure on the right is Kanbote in drag. The style is caricatured, typical of popular magazines (*taishū zasshi*) of the era.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Japan/Southeast Asia):** The mention of "Cafe Bintang Malam" (Malay/Indonesian for "Evening Star"), "Southern women" (*nanpō onna*), and "Angor" (likely a local wine or a corruption of "Angkor") suggests a setting in Southeast Asia. This points to the era of Japanese occupation or the immediate post-war period where stories about "Southern adventures" (*nanpō-mono*) were popular.
*   **Transportation:** The "three-wheeled vehicle" (*sanrinsha*) refers to the motorized tricycles (like the Daihatsu Midget precursors) that were ubiquitous in post-war Japan and its former territories for taxi and delivery services.
*   **Clove Tobacco:** Mention of "丁香" (Chōkō - Clove) refers to *kretek* cigarettes, which are iconic to Indonesia, further confirming the Southeast Asian setting.
*   **"Pig-box" (Butabako):** A common Japanese slang term for a police lock-up or jail cell, still used today but very much a staple of 1940s-50s pulp noir.
*   **Charlie Chaplin:** Chaplin was immensely popular in Japan. Referencing a "Chaplin mustache" was a shorthand for a specific type of comical disguise.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **奇妙キテレツ (Kimyō Kiteretsu):** An emphatic way of saying "extremely strange" or "bizarre." "Kiteretsu" became famous later via the manga *Kiteretsu Daihyakka*, but it was common period slang.
*   **どたま (Dotama):** A rough, colloquial way of saying "head" (*atama*). Often used in detective or "hard-boiled" fiction.
*   **ケツカル (Kekkaru):** A highly informal, often derogatory auxiliary verb used after another verb (here "iru" becomes "ite-kekkaru") to express annoyance or contempt toward the subject's actions.
*   **嘘八百 (Uso Happyaku):** Literally "800 lies"; an idiom meaning a complete pack of lies.
*   **色女 (Iro-onna):** A mistress, a "loose" woman, or a lady-love.
*   **ラチがあかない (Rachi ga akanai):** An idiom meaning "to make no progress" or "to remain unsettled."
*   **丁香 (Chōkō):** Clove. Usually written in katakana (クローブ) today, but the kanji reinforces the "exotic" spice-trade setting.
*   **南方女 (Nanpō-onna):** "Southern woman." In the 1940s, this specifically referred to women from Southeast Asia (the South Seas).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Noir and Suspense:** The text uses classic tropes: a missing husband, a mysterious letter, a "dead" man who might be alive, and a secret meeting at a smoky cafe.
*   **Disguise and Identity:** The climax of this page is the comedic reveal of "The Mantis" in a fake mustache and "Kanbote" in drag. This reflects a common trope in *ero-guro-nansensu* (erotic grotesque nonsense) literature where gender-bending and disguises are used for both plot advancement and humor.
*   **The "Exotic" South:** The setting is treated as a place of danger, strong smells (tobacco and body odor), and mystery. To a Japanese audience of the 1940s/50s, this represented a world of both past imperial memory and current adventurous intrigue.
*   **Tone:** The tone shifts from Mariam’s melodramatic grief to the hard-boiled musings of the policeman, ending in a comedic "visual gag" described in text.
