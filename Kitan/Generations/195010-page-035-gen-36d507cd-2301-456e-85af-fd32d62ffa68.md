「ゲェッ？、僕ねえ、ちょっと便所へ行くからね、あ、ちょっとそのオーバーを貸して、風邪をひいているからな、おつと、鞄の中に紙も入つていた」

**四、お多福娘**

午後10時――。にぎやかなのは國鐵大阪驛だけで、阪急も阪神も人影は至極まばらである。僕は駅の賣店へ入つてゆくと、つづけざまにソーダ水を三杯のんだ。どうやら胸がスゥッとする。さつきから失敗つづきで、まだ一人の女の子もつかんでいない。こんなヘマをやるくらいなら最初の会社の女の子をどこかへつれこめばよかった…なあに、用心すれば腹ぼてにする心配はないしまかりまちがつて騒首になつたつて、どうせ月給の遲欠配つづきのボロ会社だ。ながく尻を据えて得になるはずもない…、ちえつ、しまつた、と後悔のヘソを噛んだがもうおそい。
警察の刈りこみが嚴重なものだからこのごろはパンパンも戰法をかえたらしく、二三年前みたいに、いきのいいピチピチした闇の人魚が自身で客をあさらない。たいていがゾッとした薄ぎたないおかみさんや、お婆さん連中がポン引をやっている。
「どうだいだす、旦那」
「安うしときまっさかい…」
「素人の娘のアルバイトだつせ」
いやはや、こちらの鼻の下が長く見えるらしく、二三間あるあいだにがやがやとよりかつてくる。桑原々々その手のにのつてたまるもんか。豚小屋みたいなところへ案内されて、人三化七みたいなのを押しつけられてはあははの骨頂だ。
そうおもいながら、大阪驛と阪急の中途にある有料公衆便所の横まで来た。たしか去年の秋ごろ、この辺で、酔つ拂いがルンペンに絞め殺され、着ていたものを身ぐるみ剝がれて、死体となっていた。それをおもい出してぞっとして足早やに通りすぎようとすると、芝生の木陰で、誰かうちくまつてごそごそしている。身体は大きいが目玉の小さい僕がどきりとして眼を凝らすと、どうやら女らしい。
好奇心と冒険とごつちやになつて、こわごわ近寄ると、まだ十七八の若い娘が、芝生にうずくまり、何か風呂敷包のようなものに顔をあて、しくしく啜り泣いて居た。
「もし……、どうしたんだい、気分でもわるいのとちがうか、お腹が痛いのだったらカオールをあげよう」
どうも若い女にはやさしくて甘いのが僕の缺點だ。
「……」
「こんなところに居ると人があやしむからね、ちょっと明るいところまでおいで相談があったら乗つたあげるから…」
にのまれもせんのに、娘の背中をかるく叩くと、うれ切つた西瓜みたいにポンポンと弾むぐらいはち切つた肉付きである。
なんとか彼とか譯るのを促して、駅前にまだ店をあけているうどん屋へつれて行つた。熱いきつねうどんを一杯ずつ食べているうちに、僕は娘の顔や身体付きを一通り見まわした。言葉のなまりはどうも山陰の松江あたりらしい、もつきりした着物と、パーマメントがちぐはぐだ。
「あなた、家出をして大阪へ来たのだろ？」
それがそのものズバリと的中して、わかりにくい松江弁でボツボツ娘が白状したのによると、別に複雑な家庭悲劇やなんかで、せっぱつまつたのではなく、フワーッとした娘心で、友人と二人で大阪へ職を求めに来たのらしい。現金は田舎でも不自由だから、あるだけの着物を風呂敷に包んで、大阪で金に換えるつもりだつたと云う。
「そりや、だめだよ、衣料品はいま投げ賣り時代だし、金ずまりで古着みたいなものを誰が買うものか、たとえ古着屋へ持って行っても、物資購入通帳...

**四、お多福娘**

午後10時――。賑やかなのは国鉄大阪駅だけで、阪急も阪神も人影は至極まばらである。僕は駅の売店へ入っていくと、続けざまにソーダ水を三杯飲んだ。どうやら胸がスッとする。さっきから失敗続きで、まだ一人の女の子も捕まえていない。こんなヘマをやるくらいなら、最初の会社の女の子をどこかへ連れ込めばよかった……。なあに、用心すれば妊娠させる心配はないし、万が一騒ぎになっても、どうせ月給の遅配・欠配続きのボロ会社だ。長く居座って得になるはずもない……。ちぇっ、しまった、と後悔の臍を噛んだがもう遅い。
警察の取り締まりが厳重なものだから、この頃はパンパンも戦術を変えたらしく、二、三年前みたいに、生きの良いピチピチした闇の人魚が自身で客を漁らない。大抵がゾッとするような薄汚いおかみさんや、お婆さん連中がポン引きをやっている。
「どうだい、旦那」
「安くしておきまっさかい……」
「素人の娘のアルバイトだっせ」
いやはや、こちらの鼻の下が長く見えるらしく、二、三間の間にガヤガヤと寄ってくる。くわばらくわばら、その手に乗ってたまるもんか。豚小屋みたいなところへ案内されて、化け物みたいなのを押し付けられては、アホの骨頂だ。
そう思いながら、大阪駅と阪急の中間にある有料公衆便所の横まで来た。確か去年の秋頃、この辺で酔っ払いが浮浪者に絞め殺され、着ていた物を身ぐるみ剥がれて死体となっていた。それを思い出してゾッとして足早に通り過ぎようとすると、芝生の木陰で誰かがうずくまってゴソゴソしている。体は大きいが目玉の小さい僕がドキリとして目を凝らすと、どうやら女らしい。
好奇心と冒険がごっちゃになって、恐る恐る近寄ると、まだ十七、八の若い娘が芝生にうずくまり、何か風呂敷包みのようなものに顔を当て、しくしくすすり泣いていた。
「もしもし……どうしたんだい？ 気分でも悪いんじゃないか？ お腹が痛いんだったらカオール（鎮痛剤）をあげよう」
どうも若い女には優しくて甘いのが僕の欠点だ。
「……」
「こんなところにいると怪しまれるからね。ちょっと明るいところまでおいで。相談があったら乗ってあげるから……」
嫌がりもしないのに娘の背中を軽く叩くと、熟れ切った西瓜みたいにポンポンと弾むぐらい、はち切れんばかりの肉付きである。
なんとか説得して、駅前にまだ店を開けているうどん屋へ連れて行った。熱いきつねうどんを一杯ずつ食べているうちに、僕は娘の顔や体つきを一通り見回した。言葉の訛りはどうも山陰の松江あたりらしい。古臭い着物とパーマがちぐはぐだ。
「あなた、家出をして大阪へ来たんだろう？」
それが図星で、分かりにくい松江弁でぽつぽつと娘が白状したところによると、別に複雑な家庭の悲劇があったわけではなく、ふわっとした娘心で、友人と二人で大阪へ職を求めに来たらしい。現金は田舎でも不自由していたから、持っているだけの着物を風呂敷に包んで、大阪で金に換えるつもりだったという。
「そりゃあ駄目だよ。衣料品は今投げ売り時代だし、金詰まりで古着みたいなものを誰が買うものか。たとえ古着屋へ持って行っても、物資購入通帳……」

"Eh? Then, that...?"
"It is Ushijima's daughter, you see."
"Gah?! Me, well, I'm going to the toilet for a moment, so, ah, lend me that overcoat for a bit, since I have a cold. Oops, there was paper in the bag too."
I, as if snatching them, took the overcoat and bag, tumbled down the stairs, handed five hundred-yen bills to the Madam who looked puzzled, and fled in a state of desperation.

**4. The Otafuku Girl**

10:00 PM—. The only busy place is the National Railway Osaka Station; at both Hankyu and Hanshin, figures of people are extremely sparse. I entered a station stall and drank three sodas in a row. Somehow my chest feels refreshed. I've had a string of failures since a while ago and haven't caught even one girl yet. If I was going to mess up like this, I should have taken that girl from the first company somewhere... well, if one is careful there's no worry of making a belly-bulge (pregnancy), and even if by some mistake it became a scandal, it's a junk company with constant salary delays and non-payments anyway. There's no way staying long would be a gain... Tsk, dammit, I bit the navel of regret, but it's too late.
Because the police crackdowns are severe, these days the "pan-pan" girls seem to have changed tactics; unlike two or three years ago, the lively, fresh "mermaids of the darkness" do not hunt for customers themselves. Mostly, shivering-ly dirty older wives or old lady groups are doing the pimping.
"How about it, Master?"
"I'll make it cheap for ya..."
"It's an amateur girl's part-time job."
Good grief, my "under-the-nose" must look long (I look lecherous), as they crowd around noisily within a space of two or three *ken*. Heaven forbid, as if I'd fall for that. Being led to a place like a pigsty and having someone who is "three parts human, seven parts monster" forced on me would be the height of stupidity.
Thinking so, I came to the side of the paid public toilet between Osaka Station and Hankyu. Certainly around autumn last year, near here, a drunk was strangled by a "runpen" (lumpen), stripped of everything he wore, and became a corpse. Recalling that, I felt a chill and tried to pass by quickly, but in the shade of the lawn trees, someone was huddling and rustling. I, with a large body but small eyes, felt a throb and strained my eyes; it seemed to be a woman.
Curiosity and adventure becoming mixed, I approached fearfully; a young girl of still seventeen or eighteen was crouching on the lawn, her face pressed against something like a *furoshiki* bundle, sobbing quietly.
"Excuse me... what's the matter? Are you feeling unwell? If your stomach hurts, I'll give you a Kaoru."
Being kind and soft toward young women is my weakness.
"..."
"If you stay in a place like this, people will be suspicious. Come to a slightly brighter place. If you have something to discuss, I'll listen..."
Though she didn't even recoil, when I lightly tapped the girl's back, she had fleshiness so bursting it would bounce like a fully ripened watermelon.
Urging her this way and that to explain, I took her to an udon shop still open in front of the station. While eating a bowl of hot kitsune udon each, I looked over the girl's face and build. Her accent seems to be from around Matsue in San'in; her rustic kimono and permanent wave are a mismatch.
"You ran away from home and came to Osaka, didn't you?"
That hit the mark exactly, and according to what the girl confessed bit by bit in difficult Matsue dialect, it wasn't a particularly complex family tragedy or anything, but with a flighty girl's heart, she apparently came to Osaka with a friend to seek work. Because cash was scarce even in the country, she said she intended to wrap all the clothes she had in a *furoshiki* and exchange them for money in Osaka.
"That's no good. Clothing is in a 'fire sale' era now, and with the money crunch, who would buy things like old clothes? Even if you take them to a second-hand shop, the Goods Purchase Ledger..."

"Huh? You mean *her*?"
"That’s right, Ushijima’s daughter."
"Yikes! Listen, I’ve gotta hit the head. Hey, lend me your overcoat, will you? I’ve got a bit of a cold. Oh, and there was some paper in that bag too..."
I snatched the coat and bag, scrambled down the stairs, threw five hundred-yen bills at the bewildered proprietress, and beat a hasty retreat.

**IV. The Moon-Faced Girl**

It was 10:00 PM. Only the National Railway’s Osaka Station showed any signs of life; the Hankyu and Hanshin terminals were ghost towns. I ducked into a station kiosk and downed three sodas in quick succession. Finally, the tightness in my chest eased. I’d had nothing but bad luck all evening—hadn't managed to pick up a single girl. If I’d known I’d screw up this badly, I should have just taken that girl from the first company somewhere... Oh well, if you're careful, you don't have to worry about "knocking her up," and even if things went south and caused a stir, so what? I work for a pathetic outfit that can’t even pay its salaries on time anyway. There's no point in being a loyal foot soldier for a company like that. *Damn it*, I thought, cursing my luck, but it was too late for regrets now.

The police had been cracking down hard lately, so the streetwalkers—the "pan-pan" girls—seemed to have changed their strategy. You didn't see the fresh, lively "mermaids of the shadows" hunting for their own marks like they did a few years back. Now, it was mostly a bunch of grimy, middle-aged hags and old crones acting as pimps.
"How about it, Gov'ner?"
"I'll give you a real bargain..."
"She's just a regular girl working a side job."
Good grief, I must have "lecher" written all over my face, because within a few yards they were swarming me. *God forbid* I’d fall for that. Getting lured into some pigsty only to have some "three-parts-human, seven-parts-beast" forced on me would be the height of idiocy.

Musing on this, I reached the paid public toilets between Osaka Station and the Hankyu line. I distinctly remembered a story from last autumn about a drunk who was strangled by a vagrant around here, stripped of his clothes, and left for dead. The memory gave me the creeps, and I tried to hurry past, but then I spotted someone huddling in the shadows of the trees on the lawn. I’m a big guy but I’ve got small eyes; I squinted, my heart thumping, and realized it was a woman.

Driven by a mix of curiosity and a sense of adventure, I approached her cautiously. It was a young girl, no more than seventeen or eighteen, crouching on the grass with her face buried in a *furoshiki* bundle, sobbing quietly.
"Hey there... what's wrong? Are you feeling sick? If your stomach hurts, I’ve got some medicine."
Being a sucker for a young woman in distress is my greatest weakness.
"..."
"People will get the wrong idea if you stay out here. Come somewhere a bit brighter. If you're in trouble, I'll help you out."
She didn't pull away, so I gave her a light pat on the back. She was surprisingly sturdy—firm and plump, like a perfectly ripened watermelon.
After a bit of coaxing, I led her to an udon shop near the station that was still open. As we tucked into bowls of hot *kitsune* udon, I took stock of her. Her accent sounded like it was from the Matsue area, up in the San'in region. Her rustic kimono and permed hair were a bizarre match.
"You ran away from home to come to Osaka, didn't you?"
I hit the nail on the head. In her thick, halting Matsue dialect, she confessed that it wasn't some grand family tragedy that drove her here. She’d just been restless and had followed a friend to the city to find work. Cash was hard to come by back home, so she’d packed all the clothes she owned into that bundle, thinking she could sell them for a fortune in Osaka.
"Forget it," I told her. "The market's flooded with textiles right now. Everyone’s broke—who’s going to buy second-hand rags? Even if you took them to a shop, without a ration book..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Typography:** Uses traditional vertical Japanese typesetting (*tate-gaki*). The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing.
*   **Orthography:** Employs *kyu-kanazukai* (old kana usage) and traditional kanji forms (e.g., 國 for 国, 驛 for 駅, 變 for 変). This is characteristic of the late 1940s to early 1950s before the full adoption of modern simplifications.
*   **Layout:** The text is organized into two columns. The top section appears to be a concluding snippet of a previous scene or chapter, followed by the title "Four: Otafuku Musume."
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing in the upper right shows a woman with a permed hairstyle and a somewhat weary or skeptical expression, matching the "Otafuku" (homely but charming/plump) description or perhaps representing the "Madam" mentioned in the text.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is set in a larger, bolder font to denote a new section. The page number (35) is centered at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Post-War Osaka:** The story is set around Osaka Station (Umeda), a major transit hub. The mention of Hanshin and Hankyu railways places the geography precisely.
*   **Pan-pan Girls:** A slang term for street prostitutes who catered primarily to the Occupation forces but also to Japanese men. The narrator notes a change in their "tactics" due to police crackdowns (*karikomi*).
*   **Runpen (Lumpen):** From the German *Lumpenproletariat*, used in Japan to refer to the homeless and vagrants who lived in ruins and stations after the war.
*   **Matsue Dialect:** The girl is from the San'in region (Shimane Prefecture). In the post-war era, many young people fled the poverty of the countryside for the perceived opportunities of the big cities (Osaka/Tokyo), often with little more than a bundle of clothes.
*   **Economic Despair:** References to "junk companies" (*boro-kaisha*) not paying salaries and the "fire sale era" (*nagesuri-jidai*) of clothing reflect the hyperinflation and commodity shortages of the late 1940s.
*   **Rationing:** The mention of "Goods Purchase Ledger" (*busshi kōnyū tsūchō*) refers to the strict rationing system that persisted for several years after 1945.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **Otafuku (お多福):** Literally "much good fortune." It refers to a traditional mask of a woman with puffed cheeks. It is often used as a euphemism for a woman who is "homely" or "plump" but has a charming, wholesome quality.
*   **Kaoru (カオール):** A real brand of analgesic/sedative popular in the early Showa period. Carrying it implies the narrator considers himself a bit of a "man of the world."
*   **Hana no shita ga nagai (鼻の下が長い):** Literally "having a long space under the nose." An idiom meaning someone is lecherous or a "sucker" for women.
*   **Kuwabara Kuwabara (桑原々々):** A traditional phrase used to ward off bad luck or lightning, similar to "Heaven forbid" or "knock on wood."
*   **Hō-hō no tei (ほうほうのてい/這う這うの体):** An idiom meaning to flee in a miserable state or to barely escape.
*   **Kitsune Udon (きつねうどん):** Udon with fried tofu. A staple cheap meal in Osaka.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Urban Cynicism vs. Rural Naivety:** The narrator is a cynical, slightly sleazy city dweller who hunts for "girls," yet he shows a streak of misplaced "kindness" (or opportunism) when he finds a desperate girl from the country.
*   **The Struggle for Survival:** The backdrop is a world of murders, pimps, and failing companies. Everyone is "hustling"—even the "amateur" girls looking for part-time work.
*   **The "Fall" of the Country Girl:** The subtext suggests that the girl, having arrived with nothing but clothes to sell (which are worthless), is at high risk of being recruited by the pimps the narrator just avoided.
*   **Masculinity and Ego:** The narrator frequently references his "weakness" for women and his physical stature, painting himself as a "hard-boiled" but ultimately soft-hearted protagonist, a common trope in *kasutori* (pulp) literature of the era.
