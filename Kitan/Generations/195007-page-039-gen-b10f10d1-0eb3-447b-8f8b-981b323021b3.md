## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

人を食いものにするこんな惡徳土建に對して、胸がムカ〜してきたのでべつと唾を吐いた。（最近端眠を極めたこのA土建の社長が詐欺横領容疑で檢擧されたことを知つて、私はすつと溜飲が下つた）
このインチキ無盡の手は住宅だけでなく、自轉車、家具ラジオ、時計、疊床、佛壇、消防ポンプなど少し金目の物ならなんでも惡徳商人の好餌になる。諸君よ、くれぐれもカモになつてはいけない。
そんなのはたいていは會員組織と云う名目になつて居り一口一万円、又は五千円で、実例をあげると、一万円なら申込金四百円、残りの九千六百円は月八百円の十二ヶ月掛金となつて居る。一年後には一万円程度の品物がすべての人の行き渡る仕組だと云うが、やつと、手に入れてギョ、ギョッとするような粗悪品ですつたんもんだの擧句泣き寢入りになるのが落ちである。
但し、この無盡式月賦販賣は昨年十一月無盡業法違反で大目玉を食い、いまは全く禁止されて居るが、この手でゴツソリ儲けたアプレゲール型のあぶく會社はずいぶん多いらしい。
大体どの月賦販賣も、品物や住宅は欲しいがあんまり高くて手が出ないサラリーマン階級の心理を利用して、無利子で使えるあぶく金をかき集めるのが目的なのだから、結局は早かれおそかれ馬脚をあらわしてしまう。
むかしのように、たとえば五千円のラジオを十回拂月五百円、第一回の拂い込みと同時に品物を渡す……と云うような甘い話があつたら、（よほど大資本の信用できる會社なら別だが）まあ眉に唾をつけて欺されないように用心した方がいい。業者の方だつて、品物を渡したけれど、お客がそれきりドロンと消えうせ、あとの月賦が倒されるようでは商売にならず、そんな危險を百も承知でやるのは、よほど金ずまりのひどいボロ會社の粗悪品にきまつて居るからだ。
やはり何と云つても月賦は高くつくか、品物が落ちるのが常識だから、なるべくは、少しずつでも貯金しておいて金がたまつてから、現金で良い品を選んで買うに越したことはあるまい。

三、月收三萬圓の・内職の裏おもて

失業、金ずまり、就職難に脅える哀れな人々は、なにか適当な内職とか仕事はないかと毎日のように新聞の案内廣告を、目を皿にして隅から隅まで探している。肉体労働のできない事務系統の人々にはなおさらこの悩みは深いであろう。
それを食いものにするのが、惡らつな内職や副業の廣告である。
「月收二万円男女誰でも出来る」
「内職で生活安定収入多大」
「地方支局長求む、簡便な机上事務」
「たつか千円の資本で即日開業」
などと囃し立てゝあるを見ると、誰でもついフラフラと乗つてしまう。そして、「説明書要百円」とある通り、正直に百円同封して申し込んでみることになる。
ところが廣告をよく讀むとその廣告主の居る所は掲載された新聞とはべらぼうに遠く離れた所になつて居る。たとえば、大阪の新聞に乗るのは北海道や九州の廣告主、逆に四国や山陰や北陸の新聞に乗るのは大阪の廣告主である。
つまり、これにインチキの第一歩がかくれて居るので、廣告主は直接訪問されるのが一番いやなので、正体を絶対見せないところに秘密があるわけだ。私はわざと手をまわして遠い地方の新聞を集め、大阪市内が住所になつて居る廣告主を書きぬくと、片つぱしから探訪してみたのである。

A 月收二萬圓の男女外交員とは？

アベノ橋の南西、大阪市民病院裏のゴミ〜した横道を、探しまわんでやつと発見したのは吹けば飛ぶようなバラックの一軒家。〇〇商事大阪支局と爛つた表札が軒下にぶら下つて居る。私はプッと吹き出した。幽霊の正体見たり、馬鹿々々しい限りである。
狸のような狡い顔をした五十前後の支局長とやらに会つてみると、土間に積んだ聞いたこともない三文雑誌を一冊くれて
「これを一冊二十五円で渡しますから五十円で売つて下さい。どこへでも賣れま〜よ。一日三十冊で七百五十円の儲け、一ヶ月三十日なら楽に二万円を越えますぜ、なお千部賣れば固定給として二千円の他、奮斗賞として千円差し上げる」

人を食いものにするこんな悪徳土建に対して、胸がムカムカしてきたのでべっと唾を吐いた。（最近、不祥事を極めたこのA土建の社長が詐欺横領容疑で検挙されたことを知って、私はすっと溜飲が下がった）
このインチキ無尽の手は住宅だけでなく、自転車、家具、ラジオ、時計、畳床、仏壇、消防ポンプなど少し金目の物なら何でも悪徳商人の好餌になる。諸君よ、くれぐれもカモになってはいけない。
そんなのは大抵は会員組織という名目になっており、一口一万円、又は五千円で、実例を挙げると、一万円なら申込金四百円、残りの九千六百円は月八百円の十二ヶ月掛金となっている。一年後には一万円程度の品物がすべての人に行き渡る仕組みだというが、やっと手に入れてギョギョッとするような粗悪品で、すったもんだの挙句泣き寝入りになるのが落ちである。
但し、この無尽式月賦販売は昨年十一月、無尽業法違反で大目玉を食い、今は全く禁止されているが、この手でごっそり儲けたアプレゲール型のあぶく会社はずいぶん多いらしい。
大体どの月賦販売も、品物や住宅は欲しいがあんまり高くて手が出ないサラリーマン階級の心理を利用して、無利子で使えるあぶく金をかき集めるのが目的なのだから、結局は早かれ遅かれ馬脚を露わしてしまう。
昔のように、例えば五千円のラジオを十回払い月五百円、第一回の払い込みと同時に品物を渡す……というような甘い話があったら、（よほど大資本の信用できる会社なら別だが）まあ眉に唾をつけて騙されないように用心した方がいい。業者の方だって、品物を渡したけれどお客がそれきりドロンと消え失せ、あとの月賦が倒されるようでは商売にならず、そんな危険を百も承知でやるのは、よほど金詰まりのひどいボロ会社の粗悪品に決まっているからだ。

ところが広告をよく読むと、その広告主の居る場所は掲載された新聞とはべらぼうに遠く離れた所になっている。例えば、大阪の新聞に載るのは北海道や九州の広告主、逆に四国や山陰や北陸の新聞に載るのは大阪の広告主である。
つまり、これにインチキの第一歩が隠れているので、広告主は直接訪問されるのが一番嫌なので、正体を絶対見せないところに秘密があるわけだ。私はわざと手を回して遠い地方の新聞を集め、大阪市内が住所になっている広告主を書き抜くと、片っ端から探訪してみたのである。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

To people-eating such wicked construction [companies], chest became nauseous so "pui" spit was spat. (Recently extreme scandals [reached], this A-Construction president for fraud embezzlement suspicion was arrested fact knowing, I "su" [felt] relief of stomach.)
This fake mutual-aid method is not only housing, but bicycles, furniture, radios, watches, tatami mats, Buddhist altars, fire pumps, etc. if slightly valuable thing, anything becomes wicked merchants' good bait. Everyone, by all means do not become a duck [easy target].
Such things usually in name of member organization become, one unit 10,000 yen or 5,000 yen, to give example, if 10,000 yen, application fee 400 yen, remaining 9,600 yen is month 800 yen's 12-month installments becomes. After one year 10,000 yen degree goods to all people reach structure is said, but finally, hand put in "gyo, gyo!" [surprised] such inferior goods, after much fuss result crying-to-sleep is the fall [conclusion].
However, this mutual-aid type installment sale last year November Mutual Aid Business Law violation by big eyes eat [scolded], now entirely prohibited is, but by this hand massively earned "Après-guerre" type bubble companies quite many seem to be.
Mostly any installment sale, goods or housing want but too high hand does not reach salaryman class psychology utilizing, interest-free usable bubble money scraping together is purpose because, in the end sooner or later horse legs reveal [exposed].
Like old times, for example 5,000 yen radio 10 times pay month 500 yen, first pay same time goods hand over... such sweet talk if there is (unless very big capital reliable company), well eyebrow on spit put [be skeptical] not deceived as caution better. Merchants side too, goods handed over but customer after that "doron" [disappear] vanish, remaining installments defaulted if is business does not become, such danger 100 [fully] knowing doing is, quite money-clogged terrible scrap company's inferior goods decided because is.
As expected whatever said installment is expensive, or goods quality falls is common sense because, as much as possible, even little by little savings keep and money gathered after, with cash good goods choose buy better than anything.

3. Monthly Income 30,000 Yen Side Job's Back and Front

Unemployment, money shortage, job scarcity threatened pitiful people, some suitable side job or work is there not? as every day like newspaper guide ads, eyes like plates [wide] from corner to corner searching. Physical labor cannot do office system people to, even more this worry deep probably be.
That as food making is, wicked side job or secondary job ads.
"Monthly income 20,000 yen male female anyone can do"
"Side job by life stability income large"
"Regional branch manager wanted, simple desk work"
"Only 1,000 yen capital by same day business start"
etc. shouted seeing, anyone unintentionally "fura-fura" [dizzy/tempted] rides on. And, "pamphlet requires 100 yen" as is, honestly 100 yen enclosed apply result in.
However ads well read then that advertiser being place is published newspaper with extremely far separated place became. For example, Osaka newspaper appearing is Hokkaido or Kyushu advertiser, conversely Shikoku or San'in or Hokuriku newspaper appearing is Osaka advertiser.
In other words, in this fake's first step hidden being, advertiser direct visit being most dislike because, true identity absolutely not showing place secret exists reason. I intentionally hands move [arranged] far regional newspapers gathered, Osaka city address became advertiser wrote out, from one end to another visited.

A. Monthly Income 20,000 Yen Male Female Sales Agents?

Abeno Bridge southwest, Osaka City Hospital back garbage-filled side street, searching finally discovered blow if fly such shack house. "OO Trading Osaka Branch" and dirty nameplate under eaves hanging. I "pu" burst out laughing. Ghost's identity seen, foolish limit.
Badger-like cunning face did 50s around branch manager and such meet see, dirt floor piled heard never "three-penny" [cheap] magazine one copy gave
"This one copy 25 yen by hand over because 50 yen by sell please. Anywhere sellable. One day 30 copies by 750 yen profit, one month 30 days if easily 20,000 yen exceeds, furthermore 1,000 copies sell if fixed salary as 2,000 yen besides, struggle prize as 1,000 yen give."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

I felt a surge of nausea toward these unscrupulous construction firms that prey on people, and I could only spit in disgust. (When I heard that the president of "A-Construction," who had recently been involved in a string of egregious scandals, was finally arrested on charges of fraud and embezzlement, I felt a deep sense of satisfaction.)

These fraudulent "mutual aid" schemes aren't limited to housing; they target anything of value—bicycles, furniture, radios, watches, tatami, Buddhist altars, and even fire pumps—all of which serve as bait for crooked merchants. My friends, you must be careful not to become their next victim.

These schemes usually operate under the guise of a "membership organization." For a 10,000 yen unit, for example, you pay a 400 yen application fee and the remaining 9,600 yen in twelve monthly installments of 800 yen. They claim the system ensures everyone gets a 10,000 yen item after a year, but when you finally receive it, you’re shocked to find it’s a piece of junk. After a lot of fuss, most victims simply give up and accept their loss.

Technically, these "mutual aid" style installment sales were hit hard last November for violating the Mutual Aid Business Law and are now strictly prohibited. However, there are still plenty of "Après-guerre" style bubble companies that made a fortune using these tactics.

Most installment plans exploit the psychology of the salaryman class—people who want goods or a home but find them too expensive to buy outright. The goal of these companies is simply to gather "bubble money" they can use interest-free. Eventually, their true colors are revealed.

If you hear a "sweet deal" like the old days—say, a 5,000 yen radio for ten payments of 500 yen where you receive the item upon the first payment—you should be highly skeptical (unless it’s a very large, reputable company). Sellers know that if they hand over the goods and the customer disappears, the business fails. A company willing to take that risk is almost certainly a desperate, "scrap" firm selling inferior products. In common sense, installment plans either cost more or involve lower-quality goods. It is always better to save up bit by bit and buy a quality item with cash once you have the funds.

**3. The Reality Behind "30,000 Yen a Month" Side Jobs**

Pitiful people, terrified by unemployment, financial strain, and the difficulty of finding work, scour the newspaper classifieds every day with wide eyes, searching for any suitable side job. This is an especially deep concern for office workers who aren't suited for manual labor.

Waiting to prey on them are vicious advertisements for side jobs and secondary work:
"Earn 20,000 yen a month; anyone, male or female, can do it."
"Stable life and high income through side work."
"Regional branch manager wanted; easy desk work."
"Start your own business today with only 1,000 yen capital."

When people see these flashy promises, they find themselves tempted. They follow the instruction to "enclose 100 yen for a pamphlet" and honestly send off their money.

However, if you read the ads closely, the advertisers are usually located incredibly far from where the newspaper is published. For instance, ads in Osaka papers are from advertisers in Hokkaido or Kyushu, while ads in regional papers like those in Shikoku or Hokuriku are from Osaka. This is the first step of the scam; the advertisers want to avoid direct visits and keep their true identities hidden. I went out of my way to collect newspapers from distant regions, noted down the advertisers with addresses in Osaka, and visited them one by one.

**A. What are these "20,000 Yen a Month" Sales Agents?**

Southwest of Abeno Bridge, in a trash-filled alley behind the Osaka City Hospital, I finally found the place: a dilapidated shack that looked like it would blow away in a strong wind. A filthy nameplate reading "XX Trading, Osaka Branch" hung under the eaves. I burst out laughing. It was the classic case of "seeing the true form of the ghost"—completely pathetic.

I met the "Branch Manager," a man in his late 40s with a face as cunning as a badger. He handed me a copy of a cheap, obscure magazine I’d never heard of.
"I'll give you these for 25 yen a copy," he said. "Sell them for 50 yen. You can sell them anywhere. If you sell 30 a day, that's 750 yen profit. In a 30-day month, you'll easily clear 20,000 yen. Plus, if you sell a thousand copies, I'll give you a 2,000 yen base salary and a 1,000 yen 'effort bonus.'"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This appears to be a page from a general interest magazine (*zasshi*) or a social commentary tabloid from the late 1940s to early 1950s.
*   **Typography:** The text is set in traditional vertical columns (*tategaki*), reading from top-to-bottom and right-to-left. The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface typical of mid-century printing.
*   **Structure:**
    *   The top section is a personal essay/editorial warning against installment scams (*geppu*).
    *   The bottom section features numbered/lettered investigative reports (Section 3 and Sub-section A) about fraudulent side-job advertisements.
*   **Visual Elements:** There is a cartoon illustration in the middle-left labeled "月賦" (Installment). It depicts a hand pointing at a deer (*shika*). This is likely a pun or a visual metaphor (possibly referencing the idiom "pointing at a deer and calling it a horse" for deception, or a pun on "shika" vs "geppu").
*   **Emphasis:** Small dots (emphasis marks) are placed next to certain characters or phrases (e.g., in the magazine sales pitch) to draw the reader's eye to the "sweet deals."

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Post-WWII Japan (late 1940s to early 1950s). This was a period of high inflation, unemployment, and "black market" economics. People were desperate for stable income, making them easy targets for scams.
*   **Installment Plans (*Geppu*):** Before the widespread use of credit cards, installment plans were a primary way for the emerging middle class (salarymen) to afford luxury items like radios or sewing machines. However, before the "Mutual Aid Business Law" (*Mujingyo-ho*) was strictly enforced, many of these schemes were essentially Ponzi schemes or predatory loans.
*   **"Après-guerre" (アプレゲール):** A French term used in Japan to describe the "post-war" generation and their perceived lack of traditional morals. In a business context, it referred to aggressive, often shady, "new money" companies that rose in the chaos of the post-war ruins.
*   **Geographic Context:** The mention of **Abeno-bashi** (Abeno Bridge) and the **Osaka City Hospital** places the investigative part of the story in Osaka, known as a hub of commerce and, historically, a place where many such "street-level" businesses operated.
*   **Income Values:** The article mentions 20,000 to 30,000 yen monthly income. In the early 1950s, the average starting salary for a college graduate was roughly 5,000 to 10,000 yen. Thus, a promise of 20,000 or 30,000 yen for "simple desk work" was an obvious "too-good-to-be-true" lure.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **無盡 (Mujin):** Originally a traditional Japanese mutual aid credit association. In this context, it refers to a specific type of installment purchase system that was often fraudulent.
*   **インチキ (Inchiki):** Slang for "fake," "cheat," or "fraudulent."
*   **アプレゲール (Après-guerre):** See "Cultural Notes." Used here to describe fly-by-night, immoral companies.
*   **馬脚をあらわす (Bakyaku o arawasu):** Literally "to show the horse's legs." Idiom meaning "to reveal one's true character" or "to be exposed as a fraud."
*   **眉に唾をつける (Mayu ni tsuba o tsukeru):** Literally "to put spit on one's eyebrows." An idiom meaning to be skeptical or on one's guard against being deceived (based on the folklore that foxes/tanuki can't trick you if you wet your eyebrows).
*   **ドロン (Doron):** Onomatopoeia for disappearing suddenly (like a ninja using a smoke bomb).
*   **三文雑誌 (Sanmon zasshi):** "Three-penny magazine." Refers to cheap, low-quality, sensationalist tabloids or pulp magazines.
*   **外交員 (Gaikō-in):** A sales representative or canvasser, often door-to-door.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Struggle of the "Salaryman":** The text highlights the vulnerability of the white-collar worker who lacks the physical strength for manual labor but lacks the capital to survive unemployment.
*   **Skepticism of Modernization:** While installment plans were a modern convenience, the author frames them as a trap for the unwary, advocating for the traditional virtue of saving cash.
*   **The "City vs. Country" Scam:** The author uncovers a specific tactic where scammers advertise in newspapers far from their physical location to prevent victims from showing up at their door.
*   **The "Get Rich Quick" Illusion:** The magazine salesman’s pitch is a classic "hustle" narrative—promising high returns for "easy" work that is actually grueling and nearly impossible (selling 30 obscure magazines a day door-to-door).

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Investigative Journalism, Social Critique, Editorial.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Fraud/Scams, Post-war economy, Consumer protection, Labor, Poverty, Urban life (Osaka).
*   **Tone:** Cynical, cautionary, somewhat "hard-boiled" investigative style.
