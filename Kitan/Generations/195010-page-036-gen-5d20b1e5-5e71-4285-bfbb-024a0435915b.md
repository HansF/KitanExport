## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

がなかつたら怪しんで買わないよ」
まさにその通り。あてにした古着は売れないし、職業安定所は長蛇の列だし、今朝ついてからいままでうどん一杯食べていないのだった。友人の行方もわからないらしい。
「こんなことをしていたら、不良につきまとわれるもとだよ、警察へ保護願をだしてもらったら一番いいのだが、事がいたいそうになるからなあ…、どうだい、このままで松江へ帰つちやあ？、いま汽車に乗ったら明日の朝に着くよ」
二杯目のうどんを注文しながら僕はすすめた。
「わたしも早く帰つた方がえゝと思うんやけど…」
「汽車賃がないのだろ、おじさんが立替えて出してやるよ…」
こう僕がなぐさめてやつた途端、娘はうわね…と箸をもつたまま、チャブ台に顔を伏せて赤ん坊のように泣き出した。よつぽど嬉しかったのだろう。こんなウブな田舎の処女を宿屋へひつぱりこむほど僕は悪党じやない（…実は多福なたいな娘の御面相に食慾を失つたのが本音だが）。
田舎者はよく食べるらしいから、僕はうどん屋のとなりのすし屋で二合入りの折詰を買つて娘の風呂敷に押しこんだ、代金二百円、今度は右手に娘の手を曳き、左手に風呂敷包をぶら下げて駅の切符売場で、山陰線松江までの切符を買つてやつた。友人のことは明日でも警察に保護願を出してやることにした。
「大きに、大きに。国へ帰つたらすぐ汽車賃は送りええします…」
と、僕のやつた名刺をたいせつに帯の間く挟んで、プラットホームの石段を上つてゆく娘のぶりぶりした後姿を見送ると、僕はさつきサイダーをのんだ時よりもつといゝ気持ちになつた。

五、連れ込み宿

腕時計は午後11時チヤスト。四人の娘を抱く絶好のチヤンスを見逃したわけで、僕のサラリー袋はもう二千円ばかりになつて居た。歩いた距離も大阪駅を中心に三里以上ぐるぐる歩いた気がする。
「おうい、リンタク！」
「へえい、旦那どこまで」
威勢よくペダルをふんで、がた／＼近づいてくる車夫に
「どこでもいゝから、きれいな女の子を抱いて一晩寝かせてくれるところをたのむ、祝儀も一切合財入れて二千円しかないんだ。袋ぐるみお君に預けとくからな、うまいことやつてくれ」
「へえへえ、はい、承知の助」
車夫にサラリーの袋ぐち渡して、すつからかんになつた僕は、リンタクの幌の中へころがりこむと、疲れと酔いが一ぺんにで、こくりこくり居眠りを始めた。
がた／＼と妙に暗い構をいくつも抜け、どこか判らぬ町の、軒燈が眠そうについているしもた屋風の宿屋につき出迎えの女中さんとリンタクの車夫に靴をぬいてもらい、廊下をヨロヨロと奥まつた四畳半まで運ばれたことはおぼえている。そのあとが夢うつつかすこぶるぼんやりしている。たしか背広をぬいでくれ、布団の中へ入れ、電気を消し、それから
「まるでグニヤ／＼やわ、よつぽど酔うてはる」
とつぶやいた。娘は？、いつたいどんな顔だつたのかもおぼえていない。
とにかくその翌朝、顔にかん／＼あたる日光に眼をさますと、布団の中にふうんとあまい香水のにおいが残つてゐたゞけである。
僕はまだふらふらする二日酔の頭をふりながら、女中に送られて宿の外へ出た。とたんにあつと息を呑んだ。よつぽど遠い町へ来たつもりだつたのに眼の前に阪急百貨店がそびえて居るではないか。こんちくしようめ、リンタクの車夫は、同じところをグルグルまわつたあげく、北野劇場裏の宿屋に僕を送りこんだのである。
ポケツトをさぐると、クシヤクシヤの十円札が三枚残つて居た。それで十本入のハッピーを買うとそれこそビタ一銭も僕の身には残らなかつたのである――。但し酔つて居ても流石にサラリーマンの心得、腕時計と鞄オーバはしつかりと身につけて居た。四千円使つて、秋宵一晩に五人のちがつた娘とつきあつたのは決して高くはなかろう…と僕はうらうらかな大空をつくりと見あげた（終）

「がなかったら怪しんで買わないよ」
まさにその通り。あてにした古着は売れないし、職業安定所は長蛇の列だし、今朝ついてから今までうどん一杯食べていないのだった。友人の行方もわからないらしい。
「こんなことをしていたら、不良につきまとわれるもとだよ。警察へ保護願を出してもらったら一番いいのだが、事が大層になるからなあ…。どうだい、このままで松江へ帰っちゃあ？ 今汽車に乗ったら明日の朝に着くよ」
二杯目のうどんを注文しながら僕は勧めた。
「わたしも早く帰った方がええと思うんやけど…」
「汽車賃がないのだろ、おじさんが立て替えて出してやるよ…」
こう僕が慰めてやった途端、娘はうわーんと箸を持ったまま、ちゃぶ台に顔を伏せて赤ん坊のように泣き出した。よっぽど嬉しかったのだろう。こんなウブな田舎の処女を宿屋へ引っ張り込むほど僕は悪党じゃない（…実は多福な娘の御面相に食欲を失ったのが本音だが）。
田舎者はよく食べるらしいから、僕はうどん屋の隣の寿司屋で二合入りの折詰を買って娘の風呂敷に押し込んだ。代金二百円。今度は右手に娘の手を惹き、左手に風呂敷包みをぶら下げて駅の切符売り場で、山陰線松江までの切符を買ってやった。友人のことは明日でも警察に保護願を出してやることにした。
「大きに、大きに。国へ帰ったらすぐ汽車賃は送り替えします…」
と、僕がやった名刺を大切に帯の間に挟んで、プラットホームの石段を上ってゆく娘のぷりぷりした後ろ姿を見送ると、僕はさっきサイダーを飲んだ時よりもっといい気持ちになった。

五、連れ込み宿

腕時計は午後11時ジャスト。四人の娘を抱く絶好のチャンスを見逃したわけで、僕のサラリー袋はもう二千円ばかりになっていた。歩いた距離も大阪駅を中心に三里以上ぐるぐる歩いた気がする。
「おうい、リンタク！」
「へえい、旦那どこまで」
威勢よくペダルをふんで、ガタガタ近づいてくる車夫に
「どこでもいいから、きれいな女の子を抱いて一晩寝かせてくれるところを頼む。祝儀も一切合財入れて二千円しかないんだ。袋ぐるみお君に預けとくからな、うまいことやってくれ」
「へえへえ、はい、承知の助」
車夫にサラリーの袋を渡し、すっからかんになった僕は、リンタクの幌の中へ転がり込むと、疲れと酔いが一遍に出て、こくりこくり居眠りを始めた。
ガタガタと妙に暗い構えをいくつも抜け、どこか判らぬ町の、軒灯が眠そうについている仕舞屋風の宿屋に着き、出迎えの女中さんとリンタクの車夫に靴を脱いでもらい、廊下をヨロヨロと奥まった四畳半まで運ばれたことは覚えている。そのあとが夢うつつかすこぶるぼんやりしている。確か背広を脱がせてくれ、布団の中へ入れ、電気を消し、それから
「まるでグニャグニャやわ、よっぽど酔うてはる」
と呟いた。娘は？ 一体どんな顔だったのかも覚えていない。
とにかくその翌朝、顔にカンカンあたる日光に目を覚ますと、布団の中にふうんと甘い香水の匂いが残っていただけである。
僕はまだふらふらする二日酔いの頭を振りながら、女中に送られて宿の外へ出た。途端にあっと息を呑んだ。よっぽど遠い町へ来たつもりだったのに、目の前に阪急百貨店がそびえているではないか。こんちくしょうめ、リンタクの車夫は、同じところをぐるぐる回った挙げ句、北野劇場裏の宿屋に僕を送り込んだのである。
ポケットを探ると、クシャクシャの十円札が三枚残っていた。それで十本入りの「ハッピー」を買うと、それこそビタ一銭も僕の身には残らなかったのである――。但し酔っていても流石にサラリーマンの心得、腕時計と鞄、オーバーはしっかり身につけていた。四千円使って、秋宵一晩に五人の違った娘と付き合ったのは決して高くはなかろう…と僕はうらうらかな大空をつくづくと見上げた（終）。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Without [that], suspiciously [they] would not buy."
Exactly so. Relying on old clothes, they don't sell; the public employment office is a long snake's line; since arriving this morning until now, not even one bowl of udon has been eaten. The whereabouts of a friend also seem unknown.
"If you are doing this sort of thing, it is the cause of being followed by delinquents. Getting a protection request issued at the police station would be best, but the matter would become grand... how about it, returning to Matsue as you are? If you get on a train now, you will arrive tomorrow morning."
While ordering a second bowl of udon, I suggested.
"I also think returning early is better, but..."
"You don't have the train fare, right? Uncle will advance it and pay for you..."
The moment I comforted her like this, the girl, with a "uwan..." and while holding chopsticks, put her face down on the low table and began to cry like a baby. It must have been very happy for her. To the extent of dragging such a naive country virgin into an inn, I am not a villain (...actually, to the face of the many-fortunes-looking [homely] girl, losing my appetite was the true feeling, though).
Country folk seem to eat well, so at the sushi shop next to the udon shop, I bought a two-go volume box and shoved it into the girl's wrapping cloth. The price: 200 yen. This time, pulling the girl's hand with my right hand, and dangling the wrapping cloth bundle with my left hand, at the station ticket window, I bought a ticket for the San'in Line to Matsue for her. Regarding the friend matter, I decided to issue a protection request at the police even tomorrow.
"Thank you greatly, thank you greatly. After returning to my home country [province], I will immediately send the train fare back..."
Thus, tucking the business card I gave her carefully between her sash (obi), seeing off the plump backside of the girl ascending the stone steps of the platform, I came to feel even better than when I drank cider earlier.

5. Short-stay Inn

The wristwatch is 11:00 PM exactly. Having missed the perfect chance to embrace four girls, my salary envelope had already become only about 2,000 yen. The distance walked also, centered on Osaka Station, I feel like I walked more than three ri (approx. 12km) round and round.
"Hey, Rintaku!"
"Yes, Master, to where?"
To the driver who, pedaling vigorously, comes rattling closer:
"Anywhere is fine, a place that will let me sleep for a night embracing a beautiful girl, I request. Including the tip and everything, I only have 2,000 yen. I'll leave the whole envelope with you, so do it well."
"Yes, yes, understood-helper."
Handing over the salary envelope to the driver, I, who became empty-handed, rolled into the hood of the Rintaku; fatigue and drunkenness came out all at once, and I began to doze off, nodding.
Rattling through many strangely dark gates, arriving at a quiet-residence-style inn in an unknown town where the eaves-lights are listlessly lit, having my shoes removed by the greeting maid and the Rintaku driver, being carried through the corridor to a recessed four-and-a-half mat room is something I remember. After that is dream-or-reality, extremely blurry. Surely, asking to have my suit jacket removed, being put into a futon, turning off the light, and then:
"Completely limp/soft, he's quite drunk,"
[Someone] muttered. The girl? What kind of face she had, I don't even remember.
Anyway, the next morning, waking up to the sunlight hitting my face strongly, there was only the lingering "foon" sweet scent of perfume in the futon.
While shaking my still-dizzy hangover head, I was seen off by the maid and went outside the inn. At that moment, I gasped. Even though I intended to have come to a very far town, right before my eyes, the Hankyu Department Store is towering, is it not? You son-of-a-gun, the Rintaku driver, after going round and round the same place, had sent me into an inn behind the Kitano Theater.
Searching my pocket, three crumpled ten-yen bills remained. Buying a ten-pack of "Happy" [cigarettes] with that, exactly not even a single bit (bita) of money remained on my person. However, even while drunk, as expected of a salaryman's discipline, the wristwatch, bag, and overcoat were firmly attached to my person. Using 4,000 yen, and associating with five different girls on an autumn evening, would surely not be expensive... so I gazed steadily up at the serene Great Sky (End).

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"They won’t buy them if they suspect something is wrong."
He was absolutely right. The old clothes I’d pinned my hopes on wouldn't sell, the line at the employment office stretched like a great serpent, and I hadn't eaten so much as a single bowl of udon since arriving this morning. It seemed my friend’s whereabouts were also a mystery.
"If you stay out like this, you’ll just end up being harrassed by hoodlums. It would be best to ask the police for protection, but that makes it such a public affair... Look, why don't you just head back to Matsue? If you get on a train now, you’ll be home by tomorrow morning."
I made the suggestion while ordering my second bowl of udon.
"I think I should get back soon too, but..."
"You don't have the fare, do you? Don't worry, I'll front the money for you."
The moment I offered these words of comfort, the girl let out a wail, and with her chopsticks still in hand, she buried her face in the low table and began to cry like an infant. She must have been overwhelmed with relief. I’m not such a villain that I’d drag a naive country girl like her into some seedy inn (though, to be honest, I'd lost my appetite looking at her rather plain, 'homely' face).
Knowing that country folk have hearty appetites, I went to the sushi shop next door and bought a large bento box, which I tucked into her wrapping cloth. It cost me two hundred yen. Then, leading the girl by the hand with my right and carrying her bundle in my left, I went to the ticket window and bought her a ticket for the San’in Line back to Matsue. As for her friend, I decided I’d file that police report tomorrow.
"Thank you, thank you so much! As soon as I get home, I'll send the money back..."
Tucking my business card carefully into her sash, she climbed the stone steps to the platform. Watching her sturdy figure walk away, I felt a sense of satisfaction far more refreshing than the cider I'd drank earlier.

**5. The Short-stay Inn**

My watch read exactly 11:00 PM. Having already missed the chance to dally with four other girls that night, my pay envelope had dwindled down to its last two thousand yen. I felt as though I’d walked over seven miles in circles around Osaka Station.
"Hey! Taxi!" I called out to a bicycle taxi.
"Yes, sir! Where to?" the driver shouted back, pedaling vigorously as his rickety contraption rattled toward me.
"Anywhere is fine, as long as it's a place where I can spend the night with a pretty girl. I've only got two thousand yen left for the tip and everything. I’ll leave the whole envelope with you, so just take care of it."
"Understood, sir! Consider it done!"
I handed over my pay envelope, and now penniless, I tumbled into the carriage. Exhaustion and alcohol hit me all at once, and I began to drift in and out of sleep.
We rattled through several strangely dark gates. We finally arrived at a quiet, residential-style inn in some unknown corner of the city, its eaves-lights glowing dim and sleepy. I remember the maid and the driver pulling off my shoes and hauling me down a hallway to a back room—a small four-and-a-half mat space. Everything after that is a hazy blur of dreams and reality. I vaguely recall asking someone to take off my jacket, being tucked into bed, the lights going out, and a voice whispering:
"He's like a wet rag... completely hammered."
And the girl? I can’t even remember what she looked like.
In any case, the next morning, I woke to the sun blazing against my face. All that remained in the futon was the faint, sweet scent of perfume.
Nursing a throbbing hangover, I was seen off by the maid. As I stepped outside, I gasped in disbelief. I thought I’d been taken to some far-flung district, yet there, towering right in front of me, was the Hankyu Department Store. That damn driver! He’d simply pedaled in circles and dumped me at an inn right behind the Kitano Theater.
I fumbled through my pockets and found three crumpled ten-yen bills. I bought a pack of "Happy" cigarettes, and with that, I didn't have a single cent left to my name. Still, even in my drunken state, I’d maintained the discipline of a true salaryman—my watch, bag, and overcoat were all still with me. Four thousand yen spent, five different girls in one autumn night... I suppose it wasn't a bad price to pay. I looked up at the clear, vast sky and sighed (End).

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in vertical columns (*tategaki*), read from right to left. It follows a standard literary magazine format of the era.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of *Kyū-jitai* (traditional kanji characters) and *Shin-jitai* (modern forms), which is indicative of the transition period shortly after the 1946 script reforms. For example, it uses 國 (country) and 驛 (station) but also uses modern kana for most things.
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing at the bottom shows a man and a woman in the back of a *Rintaku* (bicycle taxi), with the driver visible in front. The style is typical of mid-century "low-brow" or "pulp" magazines (*kasutori* magazines).
*   **Structure:** The page starts with the conclusion of one anecdote and transitions into a new numbered section ("Five, Short-stay Inn"). The "(End)" at the bottom indicates the conclusion of this specific story or installment.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Hardship:** The mention of "old clothes not selling" and "long lines at the employment office" reflects the economic desperation of the late 1940s.
*   **Rintaku (輪タク):** Short for "bicycle taxi." These were extremely common in post-war Japan because of the severe gasoline shortages that made motorized taxis rare and expensive.
*   **Tsurekomi-yado (連れ込み宿):** These were the precursors to modern "Love Hotels." They were simple inns where couples could stay for short periods.
*   **Salaryman Culture:** The protagonist identifies as a "Salaryman." In this era, having a "salary envelope" (*salary-bukuro*) marked one as part of the emerging middle class, even if the money was quickly spent on carousing.
*   **Currency:** The prices mentioned (200 yen for sushi, 4,000 yen total) reflect the inflationary period of the late 40s.
*   **Geography:** The setting is Osaka (Umeda district), evidenced by the mention of the Hankyu Department Store and the Kitano Theater (a famous theater in Umeda).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **多福な娘 (Tafuku na musume):** Literally "a girl with much fortune," but here used as a euphemism for "homely" or "plump-faced," often referring to the "Okame" style face which was considered traditional but not "sexually attractive" in a modern sense.
*   **承知の助 (Shochi-no-suke):** A pun on *shochi* (understanding/consent), adding "-no-suke" to make it sound like a person's name. It's a jocular, slightly dated way of saying "Roger that" or "Sure thing."
*   **しもた屋風 (Shimota-ya-fu):** A residence that looks like an ordinary house rather than a shop or commercial building.
*   **ビタ一銭も (Bita-issen mo):** "Not a single bit/cent." *Bita* refers to low-quality coins from the Edo period. It's used in the idiom for being completely broke.
*   **ハッピー (Happy):** A brand of cigarettes produced by the Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation in the post-war era.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Casual Misogyny & Charity:** The protagonist views his "kindness" to the country girl through a lens of sexual utility—he notes he only helped her because she wasn't attractive enough to sleep with. This reflects a gritty, cynical "pulp" sensibility.
*   **The Illusion of the City:** The protagonist thinks he's being taken on a long journey to a mysterious destination, only to find he’s been cheated by the driver and stayed right where he started. This is a common trope reflecting the chaotic, deceptive nature of post-war city life.
*   **Male Bravado:** Despite being cheated and spending his entire salary, the narrator maintains a "salaryman's pride," boasting that it was a fair price for a night of "adventure." It portrays a "living for the moment" attitude common in the *kasutori* (dregs) culture of the era.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story), Serialized Narrative.
*   **Genre:** *Kasutori* Literature, Pulp Fiction, Urban Sketch.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Poverty, Masculinity, Prostitution, Alcohol, Osaka, Satire.
