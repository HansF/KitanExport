## Literal English Translation
Teaching association with people, this poem/song
said there is nothing superior to it, I thought.
You must not think this is a clumsy thing,
It accords with the esteemed teachings of Confucius; thus,
Even in clumsy words, if they conform to the Way,
We may pick them up and make them water,
If the water of the waves washes (it), wash the glistening cap strings (ribbons),
And if it is muddy, wash the feet, so they wash the song
That young children sing, he heard,
And admonished people everywhere in every village who sang it.
Washing the venerable cap strings,
And washing the desirable feet, this
is because
He summons (calls for them), people must not praise (recommend) it.
If the heart of man advances (is praised), he is revered by men,
If the heart of man despises (is reviled), he is revered by men.
Being washed well (summoned well), it is like
mixing with mud. The bond
of thus is revealed and cleared,
If it becomes muddy, it is spoken of badly, and in putting off
the bad action that must be deterred,
This teaching, next/first.

Regarding associating with people long ago, was it
because intimacy was dense/deep, they perished? He asks,
And answering whether this or that might be,
Observing enduring patience, he wrote out more than a hundred
Instances of courtly sincerity (loyalty).
If there are only people who match my heart,
then there is no heart for associating with people.
If there is no heart of a man equal (to me),
And also, you must not regard the character for "Double Loyalty/Heart" as bad at the core,
to attach/write it.
○ Desiring to repay kindness (on),
is the custom of man.
To repay an enemy (ada) with enmity,
is the word of a man who knows not the Way (michi).
It is the teaching of Duke Shao; also, you must admonish this,
○ Reprimand the badness of your own self, and
Do not seek to know the badness of others.
This teaching, next/first,
is the teaching of Confucius: “Look back well
at your own self, what you should reproach,
Can your heart also expose it? How shameful/wretched.”

## Literary English Translation
There is no lesson superior to this song, which instructs us how to associate with others—so I believed.
One must not regard this as an unsophisticated matter, for it aligns with the revered teachings of Confucius. Thus:
Even if expressed in clumsy words, if they adhere to the Way, they may be gathered up and made into water.
If the wave water is used for rinsing, wash the ribbons of the gleaming cap; if the water is muddy, wash the feet.
He heard this song sung by young children and gave an admonition to the people who sang it in every village.
Washing the venerable cap strings and washing the cherished feet—because he demands both,
people must not overly advocate for one over the other. If a man’s heart is praised, he is respected by others; if a man’s heart is scorned, he is still respected by others,
provided he is frequently summoned. This is analogous to how one can mingle with the mud.
Thus, the nature of this "bond" is revealed and purified;
If one acts shamefully (becomes muddied), one is spoken of ill, and to deter that bad behavior that must be avoided,
this is the first principle.

Concerning those who mingled with people long ago: I asked if they perhaps perished because their intimacy became too dense, and he answered in the affirmative regarding whether this or that might be the case.
Observing such patience, he wrote out over a hundred instances of courtly sincerity.
If I were only to associate with those who matched my own heart, then I would entirely lose the capacity for general association.
If there is no heart equal to mine,
You must also ensure that the character for “Double Loyalty/Heart” is never affixed to your core or inscribed on your breast.
○ To desire to repay a kindness is the custom of man.
However, to repay an enemy with enmity,
is the language of one who knows not the Way. This is the teaching of Duke Shao. Therefore, you must admonish this again.
○ Reprimand the faults of your own body/self, and
do not attempt to know the faults of others.
This teaching, above all others,
is the teaching (lesson) of Confucius: “Look back well upon your own self. Can your heart truly expose what must be reproached? How utterly shameful.”

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely section type:** Didactic Essay or Scholarly Commentary/Archival Excerpt. The text presents classical ethical dilemmas using a highly formal, academic tone (*Bungo* style, historical kana). It is structured as a series of moral maxims (marked by ○) interspersed with commentary.
*   **Author attribution (explicit or implicit):** Anonymous, using an authoritative editorial voice that references historical sources (Confucius, Mencius/Canglang Song, Duke Shao) to lend gravity to the moral arguments.
*   **Target audience signals:** Highly educated male readership, familiar with classical Chinese and Japanese ethical texts. The dense, philosophical tone contrasts with, and potentially justifies, the typically sensational content of the magazine.
*   **Key Structural Elements:** Extensive use of *furigana* (ruby text) for common kanji, indicating instruction or archival intent. Section markers (○) denote new points of moral focus. The content is an extended commentary on the principle of self-discipline versus public appearance.

---

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Canglang Shishui (滄浪之水):** The initial passage directly references the famous folk song quoted in the Mencius and *Chu Ci* (Li Sao). This song dictates that one should participate in society (*wash the cap strings*) when it is pure, but withdraw and accept lowliness (*wash the feet*) when society is corrupt. This is the central metaphor of the piece: the necessary duality of public honor and private impurity.
*   **Cap Strings (冠の緒) vs. Feet (足):** A classical metaphor for high status vs. lowliness/base desires. The irony in an *ero-guro* magazine is profound; the text essentially legitimizes the pursuit of the "muddy water" provided the reader maintains an inner "cap string" of virtue.
*   **召公 (Duke Shao):** A paragon of just and humane governance in the early Zhou Dynasty. Referencing him validates the maxim against seeking revenge (repaying *ada* with *ada*).
*   **Historical Kana (歴史的仮名遣い):** Use of forms like *omohi ki* (思いき) and *oshie* (教え) anchors the text firmly in the pre-modern, scholarly register, elevating the essay's perceived importance.
*   **Post-War Morality:** In the chaotic, socially liberalizing atmosphere of post-WWII Japan, this essay attempts to re-establish classical moral boundaries, focusing intensely on inner sincerity and self-reflection (*waga mi o kaerimi yo*), a common theme when traditional external authorities (like the Emperor or the military) have collapsed.

---

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **まじはる (Majiharu):** Lit. "To associate/mingle." Here, it refers to broad social interaction, but potentially implies mixing with morally dubious individuals or circumstances.
*   **つたなき (Tsutanaki):** Clumsy, artless, unskillful. Used here to describe the language of the song, implying that wisdom can be found even in simple or base forms.
*   **浪の水 (Nami no mizu):** Wave water. Used in the classical context to mean the river/sea water.
*   **にこらば (Nigoraba):** If it becomes turbid, muddy, or morally corrupted.
*   **めす (Mesu):** Honorific verb meaning "to summon," "to call," or "to invite." The interpretation relies on whether "he" (Confucius/the ideal) summons the individual, or if the individual is frequently invited into society.
*   **双忠 (Futagokoro):** Literally "Double Loyalty," but read as *futagokoro* (two hearts/duplicity/disloyalty). This is a moral warning against being hypocritical or insincere at one's core, even when enduring hardship.
*   **あだなる人 (Adanaru hito):** Enemy, antagonist.

---

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis
*   **The Irony of Purity:** The essay is structured around the profound irony that true moral integrity requires acknowledging and dealing with "muddy water." The audience of an *ero-guro* magazine is reading the "muddy" content, and this essay provides a high-brow moral and philosophical justification for their participation.
*   **Inner Scrutiny as Evasion:** The repeated injunction to "look back well upon your own self" and not seek the faults of others functions as a form of intellectual escapism. If the reader is focused intensely on their own potential hypocrisy, they can safely consume external "filth" without moral guilt, shifting the responsibility entirely inward.
*   **The Sado-Moral Contract:** The text implies a power dynamic where virtue is tied to endurance (*shinobu*) and patience, even when dealing with those one despises. This concept of enduring the disagreeable for a higher purpose echoes the psychological complexity often explored in *Kitan Club*'s fiction.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** The statement that a man is respected whether his heart is praised or scorned, provided he is *summoned* (i.e., socially useful or accepted), heavily implies that external acceptance (the "cap") often overrides genuine moral character (the "feet").
