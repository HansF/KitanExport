I am ready to perform this high-fidelity archival extraction and analysis.

However, **it appears the source material (the image or the Japanese text from the magazine) was not included in your message.** The code provided is a boilerplate HTML template for a web archive, but it contains no specific content from *Kitan Club* or related publications.

**Please provide the image or the text snippet you wish for me to process.**

Once provided, I will strictly adhere to your 10-step protocol, including:
1. **Faithful Transcription** (preserving *kyū-kanjitai* and historical kana).
2. **Modernization** for accessibility.
3. **Literal and Literary Translations** to capture both semantics and "ero-guro" aesthetics.
4. **Scholarly Contextualization** of Showa-era sexual mores and the specific subcultures (e.g., *fuzoku*, bondage, or clinical curiosities) typical of *Kitan Club*.

**Standing by for your input.**
