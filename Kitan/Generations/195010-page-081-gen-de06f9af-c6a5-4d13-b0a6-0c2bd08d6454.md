## 2️⃣ Normalized Japanese

「変なものではありませんけれど、私の真心（心尽くし）を差し上げたいと思いますから、今夜、私の宿まで来てください」
山川様　お澄より

お澄はその紙片を、山川が飯場（はんば）から出て行く時、他人の目を避けてそっと渡した。
山川は軽く目顔で頷いてそれを受け取り、仲間の目から遠ざかって読んだ。その喜びは、彼が三十二になるこの年まで味わったことのないものだった。
山川は作業の鐘が鳴った時まで、茫然と喜びの気持ちに酔っていた。だから紙片をどこに仕舞ったのかも意識できなかった。彼はいそいそと作業に就いたのである。
「出るぞー！」
「よっしゃー！」
各々の専用のトロ（トロッコ）に二人ずつ乗って、岩石混じりの土を積んで、ダダダダと下っていく。一歩誤れば数百尺の断崖に呑まれる。この工事が始まって以来、三人の帰らぬ犠牲者を出した。働く彼らの気分も荒れきっている。
空になったトロを押して、レールの坂を上る。
「よいしょ、よいしょ」
途中で小休止し、ふと後ろを振り返った。
おやっ？ と山川は脳裏に閃きを感じた。そしてその刹那、シャツのポケットを見、ズボンを探った。無い！ お澄から貰った紙片が無いのだ。
確かに、仲間に囲まれたその男は紙片を持っている。荒田の一の乾分（こぶん）と自称する力造だ。仲間たちはわいわい騒ぎ、山川の方に顔を向けて、大口開けて笑ったり冷やかしたりする。
「ちくしょう！」
怒りと情けなさが同時に、怒涛のごとく山川の全身を襲った。彼は拳を握って一団の中に飛び込んで行こうとした。だが彼は思い直した。すると、その反動で、涙がぼろぼろと頬を伝い、情けなさと悔しさだけが残って、怒りの感情は消え失せた。
山川はくるりと向き直り、相棒を促して再びトロを押していくのだった。
一方の側では、紙片を拾った力造を取り囲んで、しばらくの間はお澄と山川との関係に話題を集中させ、嫉妬に燃えた目をギラつかせ、山川への羨望を隠さない。現場監督と何やら話している荒田の元へ、力造が走ったことによって、輪は解けた。
荒田は紙片の文字を示されるなり、「ふむ」と唸ったが、表情だけは平静に戻り、
「おい、これ、俺が預かっておくぜ」
と、ズボンのポケットに無造作に入れた。
「山川よ、お前いい女（女郎）を引っ掛けたぜ、まあ精一杯可愛がってやりな」
「この野郎、俺の先手をちゃんと知らぬ間に打ちやがった。神妙な面持ちをしていやがって、裏で何をしてるか分かりゃしねえ」
作業が終わって飯場への道々、彼らは山川に向かって、嫉妬と羨望と憎悪の感情を露骨に表して、そんな言葉を投げかけるのだった。
お澄に対しても、別の形で揶揄したのは勿論だった。
山川は、その夜お澄の宿へ行くことを断念した。行こうと考えたにしても、荒田の鋭い目が彼から離れなかったに相違ない。
それから十日余りが過ぎた。
八月十三日。三日の休暇を貰って、人夫たちは親や妻子の元へ、町へと、大部分は山を下っていった。
故郷に妻子を持たない山川は、同じような境遇にある六七人の仲間たちと一緒に人夫小屋に残った。
人夫頭の荒田は十四日の昼過ぎ、鳥取の街へ行くと云って下りたきり、十五日の夕方になっても帰って来なかった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"It is not a strange thing, but because I want to give you my heart's effort, tonight to my lodging please come."
To Mr. Yamagawa, from O-sumi.

O-sumi that piece of paper, when Yamagawa from the labor camp was going out, avoiding others' eyes, secretly handed over. 
Yamagawa lightly with an eye-face nodded and that received, and from comrades' eyes moving away, read. That joy, he becoming thirty-two this year until, had tasted thing not-existing was.
Yamagawa until the time the work bell rang, absentmindedly, in the feeling of joy was drunk. Therefore, where the piece of paper was stored also, recognize could not. He cheerfully to the work went.
"Going out!"
"Alright!"
Each in their private trolleys two people each riding, rock-mixed earth loading, da-da-da-da descending go. One step mistaken if, several hundred feet cliff into swallowed. This construction starting since, three people's non-returning victims produced. Working they, their spirits also are roughened.
The empty trolley pushing, the rail's slope climb.
"Yoisho, yoisho."
In the middle a small break, and suddenly behind looked back.
Oh? thus Yamagawa in brain a flash felt. And that moment, shirt's pocket looked, trousers searched. None! From O-sumi received piece of paper does not exist.
Certainly, by comrades surrounded that man the piece of paper is holding. Arada's number one henchman self-styled Rikizo is. Comrades "wai-wai" making noise, toward Yamagawa faces turning, large mouths opening laughing or teasing do.
"Beast!"
Anger and wretchedness simultaneously, like a surging wave Yamagawa's whole body attacked. He fist clinching into the group jump-in tried to go. But he thought better of it. Then, by that reaction, tears "boro-boro" cheeks down flowed, wretchedness and regret only remained, anger's emotion vanished.
Yamagawa "kururi" turned around, partner urging, again trolley pushing went.
On the other side's part, the paper-picked-up Rikizo surrounding, for a while O-sumi and Yamagawa's relationship to the topic gathered, with jealousy-burning eyes glaring, toward Yamagawa envy... to the site foreman Arada who was talking with someone, because Rikizo ran, the circle broke.
Arada, the paper's characters being shown, "Humm" groaned, but expression only to calm returned, 
"Hey, this, I will keep for you,"
Into trouser's pocket carelessly put.
"Yamagawa, you a good woman hooked, well, to the best of your ability love her."
"This bastard, my head-start properly while I didn't know hit (stole a march). With a solemn face acting, what he's doing from behind, one cannot know."
Work ending, on the way to the labor camp, they toward Yamagawa, jealousy and envy and hatred's emotions bluntly expressing, such words were throwing.
Toward O-sumi too, in another form teasing was of course.
Yamagawa, that night to O-sumi's lodging going gave up. Even if he tried to go, Arada's sharp eyes from him would not leave, no doubt.
After that, ten-odd days passed.
August 13th. Three days of vacation receiving, laborers toward parents or wives and children, to the town, the majority the mountain went down.
In hometown parents/wife/children not-having Yamagawa, in the same situation being six or seven comrades together in the labor hut remained.
The labor boss Arada, on the 14th after noon to Tottori's town going saying went down, on the 15th evening even when it became, had not returned.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"It isn't much, but I wanted to offer you a small token of my feelings. Please come to my lodgings tonight."
—From O-sumi, to Mr. Yamagawa.

O-sumi had pressed the note into Yamagawa's hand as he was leaving the labor camp, slipping it to him surreptitiously to avoid the prying eyes of the others. Yamagawa gave a slight nod of acknowledgment and hurried away from the group to read it. The surge of joy he felt was unlike anything he had experienced in all his thirty-two years.

He remained in a daze of happiness until the work bell rang. He was so intoxicated by the moment that he couldn't even remember where he had tucked the note away. It was with a light heart that he set off for the day's labor.

"Move out!" 
"Right!"

The men climbed two-by-two onto their respective trolleys. Loaded with rocky soil, the carts rattled down the tracks with a thunderous *clatter-clatter*. A single misstep could send a man plunging hundreds of feet down the cliffside. Since this construction project began, three men had already lost their lives. The constant danger had left the laborers' nerves frayed and their tempers short.

As they pushed the empty trolleys back up the incline, chanting "Heave-ho, heave-ho," Yamagawa paused for a brief rest and glanced back. 

A sudden flash of intuition struck him. He checked his shirt pocket and patted down his trousers. Nothing. The note from O-sumi was gone.

Across the way, a man stood surrounded by the other workers, holding the slip of paper. It was Rikizo, the self-proclaimed right-hand man of the labor boss, Arada. The men were making a ruckus, laughing mockingly at Yamagawa.

"Dammit!"

Anger and a sense of pathetic vulnerability washed over Yamagawa like a tidal wave. He clenched his fists, ready to charge into the group, but he checked himself. The sudden suppression of his rage brought tears streaming down his face. His anger evaporated, leaving only a hollow sense of misery and bitterness. He turned away and, urging his partner forward, resumed pushing the trolley.

Meanwhile, the group around Rikizo continued to gossip about Yamagawa and O-sumi. Their eyes burned with jealousy and undisguised envy. The circle finally broke when Rikizo ran over to Arada, who was busy talking to the site foreman.

Arada grunted as he read the note, but his face quickly regained its composure. "Hey, I'll hold onto this for you," he said, casually stuffing the paper into his pocket. 

"Well, Yamagawa," he called out, "you've hooked yourself a fine woman. Be sure to treat her right. You bastard—stealing a march on me while I wasn't looking. Acting so pious and humble, who knows what you're really up to behind our backs?"

As they trudged back to the camp after work, the men hurled insults at Yamagawa, their words dripping with jealousy and spite. O-sumi, too, was subjected to their crude teasing.

Yamagawa gave up on visiting O-sumi that night. He knew that even if he tried, Arada’s sharp, watchful eyes would be tracking his every move.

Ten days passed. August 13th arrived, and most of the laborers took a three-day leave to visit their families in town. Yamagawa, who had no family to return to, remained at the mountain hut with six or seven others in the same situation. Arada, the labor boss, left for Tottori on the afternoon of the 14th. By the evening of the 15th, he had still not returned.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows a standard vertical-right-to-left (tategaki) format. It is divided into two main narrative columns separated by a horizontal line, though the story flows continuously.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a traditional Mincho font. The character size is relatively small, typical of mid-century mass-market magazines. Kanji usage is a mix of older forms (*kyūjitai*) and the then-emerging modern forms (*shinjitai*), which is characteristic of the late 1940s to early 1950s transition.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Cartoon Sidebar:** On the right side, there is a boxed-in comic panel with a decorative zig-zag border. It features hand-drawn characters and speech bubbles.
    *   **Page Numbering:** The bottom right corner shows the number `( 81 )` in parentheses.
    *   **Title/Emphasis:** The title "狙う眼" (The Watching Eyes) is placed centrally within the text block, oriented vertically.
*   **Hierarchy:** The letter at the beginning is indented to differentiate it from the narrative. Dialogue is clearly marked with brackets 「 」.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s or early 1950s (Showa 20s). This is evidenced by the orthography (using "云つて" for "言って", "働らく" for "働く") and the social setting.
*   **Hanba (飯場):** The story is set at a *hanba*, a temporary labor camp for construction workers, miners, or dam builders. These were often remote and characterized by harsh conditions, a strict hierarchy, and a rough, predominantly male social environment.
*   **Toro (トロ):** Short for *torokko* (trolley/pushcart). These were manually operated carts on rails used to move debris and soil in construction projects. The text highlights the extreme danger of this work (falling off cliffs).
*   **Social Conventions:** The rivalry over "O-sumi" reflects the gender imbalance in these camps, where a single woman (likely working in the kitchen or as a local resident) becomes a focus of intense jealousy and conflict among the isolated men.
*   **The Holidays:** The mention of August 13th refers to *Obon*, the festival for the dead, when people traditionally return to their hometowns to visit family graves. Yamagawa’s lack of family to return to emphasizes his status as a "rootless" laborer.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **心つくし (Kokoro-tsukushi):** Literally "exhaustion of the heart." It means doing something with one's whole heart or offering a sincere gift/token of affection.
*   **眼顔 (Me-gao):** A look or expression made with the eyes to convey meaning without speaking.
*   **乾分 (Kobun):** Traditionally used in Yakuza or labor gangs to mean a "subordinate" or "henchman" to an *oyabun* (boss).
*   **神妙 (Shinmyō):** Usually means mysterious or divine, but in this context, it describes someone acting overly quiet, solemn, or "well-behaved" to hide their true intentions.
*   **女郎 (Jorō):** Historically a prostitute, but in rough laborer slang of this era, it was often used as a derogatory or crude term for any woman.
*   **心臓痲痺 (Shinzō-mahi):** Heart failure/cardiac arrest. In the cartoon, it’s used as a punchline for a sudden death caused by "excitement."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Masculine Rivalry & Toxicity:** The core of the drama is the jealousy of the group. Yamagawa’s personal joy is immediately commodified and mocked by the group, showing how privacy is non-existent in the *hanba* environment.
*   **Class & Labor:** The dangerous work (the "hundred-foot cliff") serves as a backdrop to the interpersonal drama, suggesting that the harshness of the environment bleeds into the men's souls.
*   **Isolation:** Yamagawa is characterized as a man with no family, making O-sumi’s letter even more precious. The theft of the letter is not just a prank; it is the theft of his hope and dignity.
*   **The "Gaze" (狙う眼):** The title "The Watching Eyes" refers to the constant surveillance by Arada and the other men, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere where the protagonist cannot act on his desires.
