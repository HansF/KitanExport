「それから、此れは、ほんのつまらぬものですが、食べて下さい」
持つて来た果物籠を差し出した。
「さあ、そんな事までして戴いて、恐縮ですね、私の方からお詫びしなければならないんですのに」
下の方では、妹が教科書を朗讀する聲が聞えて来た。夏の頃に比べると、陽足がずつと短かくなつて来た。裏の硝子窓に僅かにさしてゐた殘照が消え去ると、薄墨色が硝子窓の向うに迫つてきた。
翌日から恵子の元気な顔が工場に見られなかつた。
それから早川は度々恵子の家にも遊びに来るようになつた。
北風が吹きのる冬がやつて来た。まだ秋の様な気持で薄着をして工場へ通つていた恵子は急に變つてきた気候に、丈夫な身体にも似合わず風邪をひいた。
今迄は嘗てそんな事もなかつたので別段氣にもとめなかつたが、午後になると、頬が上氣して足が抜けるように、だるかつた。
咽喉がすべり込んだ驚愕も此頃は、砂を噛むようにまつかたつた。一休み、南向きの板塀にかかつて日向ぼつこをしていて彼女は、フラフラと倒れそうになつた。
丁度通りかつた早川が驚いてかけより、頭へ手をやると熱がある。
直ぐ工場の醫務室へ運ばれて、工場の診斷を受けた。
打撲性の濕性肋膜炎との宣告をうけた。やはり、秋に受けたボールの打撃が影響したのであつた。
その日から彼女は、自宅の二階へ寝込む身体となつた。
胸部の水をとつてもらつて気分は非常によくなつたが、午後にきまつて出てくる微熱がとれなかつた。
早川は毎日、工場が終ると、残業をやめて、彼女を訪れ、話し相手になつて力づけたりしていた。
年を越して、新年を迎えると彼女の熱もとれ、容体も非常に快くなつた。ねが頭健なだけであつただけに回復するとなると早かつた。
早川にしても、恵子にしても、もはや離れることの出来ない間柄になつていた。
前のこともあるので今度は恵子も用心をして中々工場へ出ようともしなかつた。獨身で月々相當の余裕を見ていた早川の援助があつたためもあつたが、それ以外に、彼女は、昨年の暮から、月々のものを見なくなつていた。
春が訪れた。恵子は、もう自分で、はつきりと妊娠していることを知つた。他の人には、まだそれとは分らなかつたが、……
早川は、その事を聞かされて、初めから期していたことではあるし、非常に喜んで、やがて結ぶ楽しい家庭生活の夢を描くのであつた。
初めて早川を知つてから六ヶ月ばかり経つた。新緑の若芽の萌え出す頃を迎えて、恵子の胸は再發した。早川の熱烈な愛に溺れながら、家には老いた雨親と、小さい二人の妹前途に對する希望が灰のようにくすねてゆくのを、どうすることも出来なかつた。
早川が只一人の愛人であり、只一人の力と頼む人であつただけに、その最愛の人に満足を與えることの出来ない自分となつていることが彼女には悲しかつた。
梅雨に入つた鬱陶しい日であつた。彼女は早川の写真を胸に抱きながら、青酸加里を嚥下して、その腹の中の子と共に命を絶つたのであつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
"Then, as for this, it is just a trifling thing, but please eat."
The brought fruit basket [she] held out.
"Well, having [you] go so far, [I am] thankful/apologetic, although I am the one who must apologize to you."
From below, the sister's voice reading a textbook aloud came hearing. Compared to summer time, the sunlight had become much shorter. When the afterglow that was slightly shining on the back glass window vanished, a light-ink color pressed toward the other side of the glass window.
From the next day, Keiko’s energetic face was not seen at the factory.
After that, Hayakawa became able to often come to Keiko’s house to visit.
Winter where the north wind blows came. Keiko, who had been commuting to the factory in thin clothes with an autumn-like feeling, caught a cold, unsuited to her strong body, due to the suddenly changed climate.
Until now, because there had never been such a thing, she didn't particularly take notice, but when it became afternoon, her cheeks flushed and her legs were sluggish as if losing strength.
The shock that slid into her throat around this time was red like chewing sand. Taking a break, leaning on a south-facing wooden fence doing sunbathing, she became about to fall dizzily.
Exactly passing by Hayakawa was surprised and ran over, when he put a hand to her head, there was fever.
Immediately carried to the factory medical room, [she] received the factory’s diagnosis.
She received the sentence of traumatic wet pleurisy. After all, the impact of the ball received in autumn had influenced it.
From that day, she became a body lying in bed on the second floor of her home.
Having the water in her chest taken out, her mood became very good, but the slight fever that definitely came out in the afternoon could not be removed.
Hayakawa, every day, when the factory ended, stopped overtime and visited her, becoming a talking partner and encouraging her.
Passing the year and welcoming the New Year, her fever also left, and her condition became very pleasant. Because she was naturally robust, once recovery started, it was fast.
As for Hayakawa, as for Keiko, they had become a relationship that could no longer be separated.
Because of previous things, this time Keiko was cautious and did not try to go out to the factory much. There was also the assistance of Hayakawa, who was single and saw considerable monthly surplus, but other than that, she, since the end of last year, had stopped seeing her "monthly thing" (menstruation).
Spring visited. Keiko, already by herself, clearly knew she was pregnant. To other people, it was not yet understood as that, but...
Hayakawa, being told that thing, because it was something he had expected from the start, was very happy and drew dreams of the happy family life to be joined soon.
About six months had passed since first knowing Hayakawa. Welcoming the time when the young buds of fresh green sprout, Keiko’s chest (ailment) relapsed. While drowning in Hayakawa’s passionate love, at home were aged parents and two small sisters, she could do nothing about the hope for the future smoldering away like ash.
Because Hayakawa was her only lover and the only person she relied on for strength, the fact that she had become a self unable to give satisfaction to that most beloved person was sad to her.
It was a gloomy day that had entered the rainy season. She, while hugging Hayakawa’s photo to her chest, swallowed potassium cyanide, and together with the child in her belly, ended her life.

Utsumi Yūzō

**The Uninvited Wife**

Since the staple food became distributed as flour by ration, in various places in town, the business of contract-baking crackers and bread prospered. He was originally an old-time cracker-baking craftsman, so he renovated the shop and immediately pasted posters saying "Baking for a fee" on telephone poles here and there.

"Here, it isn't much, but please have some." 
She held out a basket of fruit.
"Oh, you shouldn't have gone to such trouble," he replied. "I'm the one who should be apologizing to you."
From downstairs, the sound of his younger sister reading her textbook aloud drifted up. Compared to the summer months, the days had grown significantly shorter. As the last lingering rays of light faded from the glass window at the back of the room, a dusky, ink-colored twilight pressed against the pane.

From the following day, Keiko’s cheerful face disappeared from the factory. After that, Hayakawa began to visit her home frequently. 
Winter arrived with its biting northern winds. Keiko, still dressing lightly as if it were autumn, caught a severe cold—an unusual occurrence for someone with her robust constitution. At first, she thought nothing of it, but by the afternoons, her cheeks would flush with fever and her legs would feel heavy and leaden. Her throat felt raw, as if she were swallowing sand. One day, while leaning against a sun-drenched wooden fence to rest, she nearly collapsed.
Hayakawa happened to be passing by. Startled, he rushed to her side; her forehead was burning. He took her immediately to the factory’s infirmary. The diagnosis was "traumatic wet pleurisy"—a lingering result of being struck by a ball back in the autumn.

From that day on, Keiko was confined to her bed on the second floor of her house. Though the doctors drained the fluid from her chest and she felt better for a time, she could not shake the low-grade fever that returned every afternoon. Every day after work, Hayakawa would forgo overtime to visit her, offering companionship and encouragement.
By the time the New Year arrived, the fever broke, and her health seemed to return. Being naturally strong, her recovery was swift once it began. By then, Keiko and Hayakawa had become inseparable. 
Keiko remained cautious and did not return to the factory immediately. Part of this was thanks to the financial support of Hayakawa, who, being a bachelor, had some savings. But there was another reason: since the end of the previous year, her "monthly courses" had ceased.

When spring came, Keiko knew for certain she was pregnant. Though it wasn't yet visible to others, Hayakawa was overjoyed when she told him. He had expected this and began to dream of the happy family life they would soon share.
Six months had passed since they first met. But just as the fresh green buds began to sprout, Keiko’s illness relapsed. Even as she basked in Hayakawa’s passionate love, she watched her hopes for the future turn to ash. She thought of her aging parents and her two little sisters, and the burden she was becoming. It broke her heart that she could no longer be the woman her beloved Hayakawa deserved.
On a dismal day during the rainy season, clutching a photograph of Hayakawa to her chest, she swallowed potassium cyanide, ending her life and that of the child within her.

**The Uninvited Wife**
*By Yūzō Utsumi*

Since the government began rationing flour as the staple food, businesses that baked bread and crackers for a fee began to thrive throughout the city. Having been a traditional cracker maker by trade, he renovated his shop and immediately began pasting advertisements on utility poles: "Crackers baked to order."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is presented in a three-column vertical format, typical of Japanese magazines or "bunko" style publications of the mid-20th century.
*   **Illustration:** A line-art illustration occupies the top right quadrant. It depicts a domestic scene: a man sitting by a low table, a woman reclining (presumably the ill Keiko), and a child (the sister) in the background. The style is reminiscent of "Taisho-romanticism" but leans toward the more somber realism of the early Showa period.
*   **Typography:** Uses a mix of Kanji and Hiragana. It includes several traditional Kanji forms (Kyū-kanji) such as 氣 (気), 窗 (窓), and 醫 (医), which suggests a publication date prior to or shortly after the 1946 script reforms.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "押しかけ女房" and the author's name are placed at the bottom, functioning as a footer/header for the story segment. The text at the very bottom right appears to be the beginning of a separate section or a related anecdote regarding the economic conditions of the time (flour rationing).
*   **Page Numbering:** A small "— 19 —" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger compilation or magazine.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **The Post-War Era (c. 1945–1950):** The mention of "staple food distributed as flour" (主食が粉で配給される) is a specific reference to the extreme food shortages in Japan following WWII. The traditional rice supply failed, and the US occupation authorities (GHQ) distributed imported flour, which Japanese citizens had to turn into "suityo" (dumplings) or take to "contract bakers" to make bread or crackers (*senbei*).
*   **Tuberculosis and Pleurisy:** During this era, TB was the "national disease" of Japan. "Wet pleurisy" (湿性肋膜炎) was often a precursor or a specific manifestation of TB. The symptoms described—afternoon low-grade fever and "chest water" (pleural effusion)—were classic signs of the disease, which was often fatal or debilitating before the widespread use of streptomycin.
*   **Social Morality:** The term "Oshikake Nyōbō" (the uninvited/self-appointed wife) usually refers to a woman who moves into a man's house to care for him without a formal wedding. In this story, the tragedy is heightened by the woman's sense of duty to her "aged parents and two sisters," suggesting she was the primary breadwinner before falling ill.
*   **Suicide by Cyanide:** "Seisan-kari" (Potassium Cyanide) was a common, albeit horrific, method of suicide mentioned in literature of this period, often associated with "shinju" (double suicide) or tragic romantic ends.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **月々のもの (Tsukizuki no mono):** A common euphemism for menstruation (literally "the monthly thing"). Its cessation indicates pregnancy.
*   **肋膜炎 (Rokumakuen):** Pleurisy. A very common medical term in Showa-era literature.
*   **委託賃焼 (Itaku chin-yaki):** Contract baking for a fee. A specific post-war business where people brought their rationed flour to a professional to be baked into edible goods.
*   **薄墨色 (Usuzumiiro):** Literally "light ink color." A poetic way to describe the greyish-blue of twilight.
*   **上気する (Jōki suru):** To be flushed (with fever or emotion).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Sacrifice and Guilt:** Keiko feels a profound sense of "moushiwake-nai" (unpardonable guilt). She is unable to work to support her family and feels she is failing her lover by being sick and pregnant. 
*   **The Fragility of Hope:** The transition from the "happy dreams" of spring to the suicide in the "gloomy rainy season" mirrors the seasonal shifts common in Japanese naturalism. 
*   **Economic Despair:** The backdrop of rationing and factory work highlights the precariousness of the working class. Even a minor injury (being hit by a ball) leads to a fatal illness because of the underlying exhaustion and poor living conditions.
*   **Tragic Nihilism:** The ending is abrupt and brutal. The "hope smoldering away like ash" suggests a lack of social safety nets, where illness plus pregnancy equals a dead end.
