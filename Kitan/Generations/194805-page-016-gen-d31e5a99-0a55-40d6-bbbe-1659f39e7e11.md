**Drifters' Street's Premature Wisdom**

### Text Above Illustration (Conclusion)
People who are inexperienced, or men who are not very knowledgeable in such aspects,
if they only use the acting skills of a Phase Two bride, they
can sufficiently achieve their objective;
but if they possess knowledge, even a little, of that kind of aspect,
or if they are men who have experience in having played,
it is necessary to proceed cautiously starting with the first measure.
In my case, I completely achieved the objective using both chemicals and acting. (End)

### Main Narrative
Just then, the movie theater finished, and the main street
passed by along with the crowds of people and cheerful voices.
A group of vagrant boys who were nesting in T Park
were doing the only remaining tasks from the restaurants in this neighborhood—
or rather, washing, shoe shining,
and such.

Passing through the passage beneath the guard rails where the streetcar and the Kansai Line run,
brick-built barracks
were lined up closely along the track side, and stand-up eating places selling *kanto-ni*,
the smell of eggs, skewered cutlets (*kushi-katsu*), fried noodles (*yaki-soba*), and Western food,
were vigorously emitting cooking smoke.

Though a temporary recovery was achieved, when thinking of the hustle of the pre-war period, a hint of melancholy
and desolate stillness permeated the Shinsekai neighborhood during the
evening twilight.
Renzu and the young Saku-ni
were sitting on the hard chairs of a lively bar in front of the municipal office
and drinking Second-Grade Kasutori.
Saku-ni's torn khaki uniform was black with sweat,
and his face and limbs were shiny and greasy with grime. The face powder crumbling
on Renzu's face showed small wrinkles here and there.

He, possessing neat, narrow features and thick eyebrows,
and because of the large vagrant life, both his eyes were shining with an unusual light.
When the crowd returning from the movie theater had completely passed,
there were almost no customers even in this shop. Right under his nose,
Oren, a woman of thirty, exposing her showing-off white chest,
continued to gulp down her cup.

"I can't drink anymore," he said, opening his languid, moist eyes. He was drunk.
He hugged her chest. He pressed his cheek
onto her soft, thick thigh, which was lowered onto his eye.
...But when he saw himself in her state, she
immediately stood up.

"Drink, go on, drink and rest on top."

Her face, however, was covered by thin flesh. Her distinct face,
as if it were entirely covered by bare flesh. She,
knowing how to flirt with men both night and day...

...[Fragmented Dialogue]...
"Hmph..."
He pushed a suit toward her.
"The man who gave me the pants said, 'Come here and taste this,' or something like that,
she's all his now.

"Saku-chan, tonight, I'll
take care of you, so drink more."
"Behaving like it's a shared toilet, you act so
important!"

**Premature Wisdom of the Drifters' Street**

### Text Above Illustration (Conclusion)
If a man is inexperienced or unfamiliar with such matters, he might succeed by relying entirely on the actress-like skills of a 'Phase Two bride.' However, for a man who possesses even a little knowledge in that area, or who has experience with carousing, caution is necessary, and he must start with the initial preparatory steps. In my case, I completely achieved my goal using both chemicals and stagecraft. (End)

### Main Narrative
Just then, the movie theater had finished, and the main street was bustling with crowds of people and cheerful chatter.

A group of vagrant boys who made T Park their base were engaged in scavenging leftover food from the restaurants in the vicinity, or working as washers and shoe shiners.

If you passed under the elevated tracks where the streetcar and the Kansai Line ran, you would find brick-built shacks lined up along the railway side. Stand-up eateries selling *kanto-ni* (simmered foods), the aroma of eggs, *kushi-katsu*, *yakisoba*, and Western food were fiercely billowing greasy smoke.

Although the neighborhood had achieved a temporary recovery, the Shinsekai area, during the evening twilight, still carried a sense of melancholy and desolation when compared to the hustle of the pre-war days.

Renzu and the boy Saku-ni were sitting on the hard chairs of a busy bar in front of the municipal office, drinking second-grade *kasutori* liquor.

Saku-ni’s torn khaki clothes were black and stiff with sweat, and his face and hands shone with grime and oil. The sweat had caused the face powder on Renzu’s face to streak, revealing small wrinkles here and there.

He was large, with neat, narrow features and thick eyebrows, and perhaps due to his vagrant life, his eyes shone with an unnatural intensity. After the movie-goers had finally passed, the shop was almost empty. Right in front of him, Oren, a woman of about thirty, continued to drain her cup, exposing her conspicuously white chest.

“I can’t drink any more,” he mumbled, opening his heavy, moist eyes. He was drunk. He pulled her close by the chest. He pressed his cheek against her soft, thick thigh, forcing it down so it rested on his gaze.

...But catching sight of his own reflection in her, she immediately stood up.

“Drink, Saku-chan, drink and put your head down here to rest.”

Her face, however, was covered only by thin, taut flesh. Her distinctive face looked entirely coated in bare skin. She was someone who knew how to play (or flirt) with men constantly, night and day...

...[Fragmented Dialogue]...
“Hmph...”
He thrust a suit in front of her.
“The man who gave me the pants said he wanted to ‘try this out’ here, you see.
She’s completely his now.”

“Saku-chan, tonight, I’ll take care of you, so please drink more.”

“Acting like it’s a public latrine, you speak so self-important!”

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text presents two distinct narrative segments separated by a large, dramatic illustration and a prominent title, suggesting this is an excerpt from a serialized publication (like a magazine or newspaper fiction section).

**Format and Layout:**
1.  **Vertical Script (Tategaki):** The text is set vertically, read right-to-left.
2.  **Title:** The title, **浮浪街の早慧** (*Furōgai no Sōkei*), is written in large, expressive, brushstroke-style calligraphy, dominating the upper right section of the page.
3.  **Visual Element:** A substantial black-and-white illustration (signed *下村*) shows a man in dark clothes embracing or dancing with a scantily-clad woman, symbolizing the "floating world" nightlife mentioned in the text.
4.  **Column Structure:** The content is laid out in narrow columns (approximately 20 characters wide). The text wraps around the illustration, leading to significant fragmentation and overlapping/truncated text in the central area, particularly where dialogue occurs (making transcription difficult).
5.  **Section Division:** The text begins with a short conclusion, marked by **（終）** (End), indicating the end of a previous piece, immediately followed by the large title and the beginning of a new story, marked by the setting description (折柄、映畫館はねて).
6.  **Typography:** Uses traditional Japanese serif fonts. Archaic kana (e.g., ゐ, ゑ) and older kanji forms (e.g., 關, 畫) are used, typical of pre-war and early post-war publishing practices.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

This text is deeply rooted in the social landscape of post-war Japan (circa 1945–1955), focusing on the urban underbelly characterized by poverty, moral decay, and opportunistic survival.

1.  **The Floating World (浮浪街 - Furōgai):** The title and setting explicitly refer to the streets inhabited by vagrants and people living outside mainstream society. Post-war Japan saw massive social dislocation, leading to a large population of *furōji* (vagrant children) and displaced adults resorting to illegal or survival-based labor.
2.  **Shinsekai (新世界界隈):** The mention of "Shinsekai neighborhood" strongly anchors the setting, likely referring to the Shinsekai district in Osaka. This area, known for its Tsūtenkaku Tower and entertainment areas, was synonymous with working-class life, cheap pleasures, and poverty after the war.
3.  **Gutter Economy (ガード下のバラック):** The description of "barracks beneath the guard rails" (*gādo shita no barakku*) is a classic trope of post-war urban poverty. These locations, built quickly from scavenged materials, housed illicit businesses, black markets, and cheap eateries.
4.  **Survival Food and Drink:**
    *   **立喰飲食店 (Tachi-gui Inshokuten):** Stand-up eateries, emphasizing quick, cheap service for the working poor.
    *   **關東煮 (Kanto-ni):** Oden (simmered food), a common, inexpensive street food.
    *   **二番カストリイ (Niban Kasutorii):** "Second-grade Kasutori." *Kasutori* was a notoriously crude, often toxic distilled spirit made from the dregs of sake brewing. It was the cheapest liquor available and a symbol of poverty and desperation immediately following WWII. Calling it "Second Grade" implies it's particularly low quality.
5.  **Character Dynamics:** The relationship between Renzu (連子) and Saku-ni (策二) reflects the forced maturity and blurred lines of morality necessary for survival. Renzu's crumbling *oshiroi* (face powder) and visible wrinkles suggest a woman forced into the profession (likely prostitution or bar work) prematurely or past her prime. Saku-ni, the "boy," exhibits the cynicism and roughness expected of a youth raised in the *furōgai*.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**1. Survival and Cynicism (早慧):** The central theme is survival in a devastated urban landscape. The title, "Premature Wisdom," reflects how characters like Saku-ni and Renzu possess a hard, cynical knowledge about life, economics (scavenging, cheap liquor), and relationships (trading sex/comfort for sustenance). They are worldly but profoundly damaged.

**2. Post-War Melancholy and Decay:** The description contrasts the "temporary recovery" with the "melancholy and desolate stillness" (*boseki*) compared to the pre-war period. The setting—greasy shacks under the train tracks, the smell of cheap food and sweat—establishes a pervasive atmosphere of decay, both physical and moral.

**3. The Commodification of the Body:** The text subtly highlights the economic necessity driving Renzu’s actions. She offers comfort and sex ("I’ll take care of you," "drink and rest on top") in exchange for companionship or liquor. The dialogue comparing her to a "shared toilet" further emphasizes the devaluation and exploitation of her body within the *furōgai*.

**4. Gritty Realism:** The narrative employs sensory details (the smell of eggs and oil smoke, the shine of grime on Saku-ni’s skin, Renzu’s crumbling makeup) to ground the story in a harsh reality, typical of Japanese proletarian or *shishōsetsu* (I-novel) influenced realism of the era. The tone is non-judgmental but bleak.
