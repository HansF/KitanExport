## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

　々木が彼女の家へ入つたんです。
　彼は次男坊ですし、頑強そのものの身体で、それに、一寸人好きのするまあ男前と言われる位の顔立だつたわけです。
　その彼が、そこ迄私に話して来てから意味あり氣に、私の顔を見て、
「その上、よし江は實にいい味なんだ。その身体がね、……まあ私も道楽をした経験があるから、それ相當の女も知つているのだが、よし江の身体がね、何んとも言われない、三すくみ四ななしなんだ」
とニヤツと笑つて言うんです。
　三すくみ四ななしとゆうのは、どんな事か私にはよく分りませんでしたが、とにかく彼女の愛嬌が、非常に素晴らしいとゆう事だけは想像がつきました。
　運のよい事には、内地の部隊にいて終戰を迎えた私と佐々木は、無事に復員することが出来たのです。
　一緒に歸つた私は誘われるままによく彼の家へ遊びに行つたんです。
　その頃、私は妻を失つていた事を佐々木は知つていましたし、よし江も非常に同情して呉れて、いろいろ御馳走をして貰つたものです。
　彼女が呉心深く火災保険に五萬圓かけていましたので、戰災を受ける以前にも増して立派に再建されていました。
　終戦当時の五萬圓で建てた家ですから今だつたら五十萬圓位はするでしょうね、いや話はそれましたが、私が見た時の彼女は、三十五とか言つていましたが、實に若々しくて、色も白く子を産んだ事のない関係もあつて、二十代の若妻といつた感じでしたね。
　面長の張りのある目や、木の實の熟したような紅い光澤のある唇、スッとよく通つた鼻にも、うつすらと脂が浮いて、何んとも言えない肉感的な、それでいて、さつぱりとした感じを受けるんです。
　此れぢや佐々木の奴、寝言を言うのも無理はないと思いました。
「今度の戰爭に引つ張られた時はもう命はないものと思つたんで、十万近くの生命保険に入つたんだが、もう要らないな。」
　と彼が笑い／＼言うとよし江が、
「そうね、一そのこと流しちゃいましょうか。」
　と言つていたが、折角ここまで掛けてきたんだから、と言うわけでそのままになつていたようです。
　所が、そのうちに、佐々木が次第に元気がなくなたり、顔色が惡くなつて痩せてゆくのに気がついたんです。
　オヤ、佐々木の奴、又痩せやがつたぞ、と思つているうちに、ポックリと死んまつたんです。
　何んでも問屋から仕入れて来た車を引いて、自分の店の近くの曲り角に来た時、向うから来た自動車を避けた途端、梶棒を握つたまま、アッと言う間にアツ氣ない最後を遂げたんです。
　えヽ、勿論自動車にはねられたわけでも何んでもなく、死亡診断書には心臓痲痺と書いていましたが、
　急を聞いて私が彼の家へ駆けつけた時は、半狂亂となつて泣き悲しむよし江の前に、面やつれのした佐々木が別に苦悶の表情もなく横たわつているんです。
　私も何となく妙に胸につまりましたね。あゝ不幸な奴だとしみじみ思いました。それから一月ばかり経つて、彼女は佐々木の保険金十萬圓受け取りました。
　若しもあの時、佐々木が言つたように保険を解約してしまつてあつたならば、保険金も貰えなかつたんですが、虫が知らせたとでも言いますか、
　ここで齋藤氏は一息ついて會員の顔をズツと見廻した。
　私にも話のヤマが近づいて来た事が感ぜられた。齋藤氏の幼友達とゆうのが彼であり、齋藤氏自身が語るのであるが、話の眼目がどれであるのか私にはさつぱり判らなかつた。
　齋藤氏はグッとコツプの水を飲み干すと、チョッと舌なめづりする様にして再び語りつづけた――。
　それで彼は佐々木の死後、女手一つの店の經營に、何かとよき相談相手となつていたのですが、何にしろ女人だけの家へ、此れも早くから妻を失くした男が出入りすることで、すから當然、此所で何事かが起らざるを得ないのです。しかも女と言うのは、今が爛熟しきつた絶頂にあると

　佐々木が彼女の家へ入ったんです。
　彼は次男坊ですし、頑強そのものの体で、それに、ちょっと人好きのする、まあ男前と言われるくらいの顔立ちだったわけです。
　その彼が、そこまで私に話してきてから意味ありげに、私の顔を見て、
「その上、よし江は実にいい味なんだ。その体がね、……まあ私も道楽をした経験があるから、それ相当の女も知っているのだが、よし江の体がね、なんとも言われない、『三すくみ四ななし』なんだ」
とニヤリと笑って言うんです。
　「三すくみ四ななし」というのは、どんなことか私にはよく分かりませんでしたが、とにかく彼女の愛嬌が、非常に素晴らしいということだけは想像がつきました。
　運のよいことには、内地の部隊にいて終戦を迎えた私と佐々木は、無事に復員することができたのです。

　終戦当時の五万円で建てた家ですから今だったら五十万円くらいはするでしょうね、いや話はそれましたが、私が見た時の彼女は、三十五とか言っていましたが、実に若々しくて、色も白く子を産んだことのない関係もあって、二十代の若妻といった感じでしたね。
　面長の張りのある目や、木の実の熟したような赤い光沢のある唇、スッとよく通った鼻にも、うっすらと脂が浮いて、なんとも言えない肉感的な、それでいて、さっぱりとした感じを受けるんです。
　これじゃ佐々木の奴、寝言を言うのも無理はないと思いました。
「今度の戦争に引っ張られた時はもう命はないものと思ったんで、十万近くの生命保険に入ったんだが、もう要らないな」
　と彼が笑いながら言うと、よし江が、
「そうね、いっそのこと流しちゃいましょうか」
　と言っていたが、せっかくここまで掛けてきたんだから、というわけでそのままになっていたようです。
　ところが、そのうちに、佐々木が次第に元気がなくなったり、顔色が悪くなって痩せてゆくのに気がついたんです。
　おや、佐々木の奴、また痩せやがったぞ、と思っているうちに、ポックリと死んじゃったんです。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Sasaki her house into entered. He second son was, sturdy body had, and, a bit people-pleasing, well, "handsome" called extent of features was the case. That he, that far to me having talked after, meaningfully, my face looking at, "In addition, Yoshie truly good taste is. That body, you see... well, I too hobby/play experience have because, corresponding women also know, but, Yoshie's body, anything cannot be said, 'three-cowering four-nothing' is," with a smirk laughing said. "Three-cowering four-nothing" what thing is, to me well was not understood, but anyway her charm, extremely wonderful thing only imagination was attached.

Luck good thing was, inland unit in being end of war met I and Sasaki, safely demobilize could. Together returned I, invited as was, often his house to play went. That time, I wife had lost thing Sasaki knew, and Yoshie too extremely sympathized for me, various treats gave. She cautiously fire insurance 50,000 yen had placed, so war damage receiving before than even more splendidly rebuilt was. End of war time's 50,000 yen with built house because, now if it were 500,000 yen about would do, I think; no, story diverted, but, I saw time her, thirty-five or so was saying, but truly youthful, skin white, child born never relation also having, twenties young wife feel was.

Oval-faced firm eyes and, tree fruit ripened like red luster having lips, straight well-passed nose also, slightly oil floating, anything cannot say sensual, yet, refreshing feel receives. This way Sasaki fellow, sleep-talking say no wonder I thought. "This time war to pulled when already life no thing thought because, 100,000 near life insurance entered, but already no need." with he laughing/laughing said when Yoshie, "Right, better thing let's let it lapse/wash away." was saying, but with effort this far paid because, that's why as it was remained it seems.

However, meanwhile, Sasaki gradually energy disappear, complexion bad become and getting thin noticed. Oh, Sasaki fellow, again got thin, while thinking, "pokkuri" (suddenly) died. Anything wholesaler from stocked cart pulling, own shop near corner came time, from opposite side came car avoided moment, handle bar gripping, "Ah" saying time in, uninspiring end accomplished. Yes, of course car hit reason even nothing even not, death certificate "heart paralysis" written was, but...

Urgent news hearing I his house to rushed time, semi-distracted state becoming crying grieving Yoshie before, gaunt-faced Sasaki particularly agony expression without lying was. I too somehow strangely chest clogged. "Ah, unfortunate fellow" deeply thought. After that one month about passed, she Sasaki's insurance money 100,000 yen received. If that time, Sasaki said like insurance canceled had, insurance money even could not receive was, but "bug informed" (premonition) or should I say.

Here Mr. Saito one breath took and members' faces all around looked. To me also story's climax approaching thing was felt. Mr. Saito's childhood friend was "he", and Mr. Saito himself tells, but story's main point which is to me completely was not understood. Mr. Saito "gulp" cup water drank dry, then a bit tongue-licking like doing again story continued—. So he, after Sasaki's death, woman's hand one shop management, something good consultation partner becoming was, but anyway woman only house to, this too early from wife lost man going in and out by, naturally, here something happen must. Moreover, woman called thing, now over-ripened peak being in—

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Sasaki let himself into her home. He was a second son, built with a rugged, sturdy frame, and possessed the kind of handsome features that naturally drew people to him. After telling me that much of the story, he looked at me with a meaningful glint in his eye and smirked. "What's more," he said, "Yoshie is a real delicacy. That body of hers... well, I’ve had my share of 'extracurricular' experiences and I’ve known my fair share of women, but Yoshie’s body is... indescribable. It’s what they call 'three-fold paralysis, four-fold nothingness.'"

I didn't quite understand what he meant by that peculiar phrase, but I could easily imagine that her charms were extraordinary. As luck would have it, both Sasaki and I had been stationed with units in the home islands when the war ended, and we were both able to be demobilized safely. Having returned together, I often accepted his invitations to visit his house. Sasaki knew I had lost my wife by then, and Yoshie was always very sympathetic, frequently treating me to wonderful meals. She had been prudent enough to take out a 50,000-yen fire insurance policy, so their home had been rebuilt even more grandly than before the air raids. A house built for 50,000 yen right after the war would surely be worth 500,000 yen today—but I digress. When I saw her, she claimed to be thirty-five, but she looked remarkably youthful. Perhaps because she had never borne a child, she had the pale skin and the air of a young bride in her twenties.

She had an oval face with bright, firm eyes, and her lips had the red luster of a ripened fruit. Her straight, well-defined nose had a faint sheen of oil, giving her an indescribably sensual yet somehow clean and refreshing appearance. Seeing her, I thought it was no wonder the fellow was head over heels.

"When I was drafted into this last war, I figured I wouldn't make it back alive," Sasaki said with a laugh, "so I took out nearly 100,000 yen in life insurance. I suppose I don't need it now." 
Yoshie replied, "You're right. Why don't we just let it lapse?"
However, since they had already paid into it for so long, they apparently decided to keep it as it was.

But then, I noticed that Sasaki was gradually losing his energy. His complexion worsened and he began to waste away. I was just thinking to myself, "Damn, the guy’s looking thinner again," when he suddenly dropped dead. He had been pulling a cart full of goods from a wholesaler; just as he reached the corner near his shop, he swerved to avoid an oncoming car. While still clutching the handles, he met a sudden, uninspiring end in the blink of an eye. No, he wasn't hit by the car or anything like that. The death certificate listed the cause as heart failure.

When I heard the news and rushed to his house, I found Yoshie half-mad with grief, wailing before him. There lay the gaunt Sasaki, looking strangely peaceful, with no sign of agony on his face. My heart felt heavy; I truly felt he was a most unfortunate man. About a month later, she received the 100,000-yen insurance payout. If they had canceled the policy as Sasaki had once suggested, she wouldn't have seen a dime. One might call it a premonition.

At this point, Mr. Saito paused and scanned the faces of the group. I could feel the story reaching its climax. The man in the story was Mr. Saito’s childhood friend, and though Mr. Saito was the one telling it, I still couldn't quite grasp what the main point of the tale was supposed to be. Mr. Saito gulped down his water, licked his lips slightly, and resumed his story—

"And so, after Sasaki's death, he became a reliable advisor to her as she managed the shop on her own. But when a man who lost his wife early begins frequenting a house inhabited only by a woman, something is bound to happen. Especially when that woman is at the very peak of her maturity—"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Layout and Typography
*   **Columnar Structure:** The text is set in a traditional three-column vertical layout, typical of Japanese literary magazines.
*   **Illustration:** A large, evocative illustration occupies the lower center-right. It depicts a dramatic scene: a man leaning over a distressed woman (likely the characters Sasaki and Yoshie), with another woman's face appearing in a ghostly or background manner. This suggests a "pulp" or "noir" mystery style.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style of the era. Line spacing is tight, allowing for a high character density.
*   **Page Numbering:** The number "27" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is a serialized story or a section of an anthology.

### Visual Hierarchy
*   The text flows around the illustration, which serves as the visual anchor.
*   Dialogue is indicated by traditional Japanese quotation marks (「 」), which help break up the dense blocks of narrative text.
*   The transition between the internal narrator and the external "frame" narrator (the section starting with "Here Mr. Saito...") is not marked by a header but by a change in tone and perspective within the flow of the text.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Era (Showa 20s):** The text mentions "inland units" (内地の部隊) and "demobilization" (復員), clearly placing the setting in the immediate aftermath of WWII (late 1940s to early 1950s).
*   **Economic Context:** The mention of insurance sums—50,000 yen for a house and 100,000 yen for life insurance—provides a snapshot of the hyperinflation and changing value of money in the post-war period. The narrator notes that a 50,000-yen house would cost 500,000 "now," suggesting the story was written a few years after the events described.
*   **"Heart Paralysis" (Shinzo Mahi):** This was a common, somewhat vague medical diagnosis for sudden death in that era, often used in fiction to mask more mysterious or suspicious causes of death (like poisoning or exhaustion).
*   **Social Conventions:** The narrative touches on the social scandal of a widower visiting a widow's home, reflecting the conservative social mores of the time regarding gender and propriety.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **三すくみ四ななし (San-sukumi Yo-nanashi):** A very specific, likely archaic or slang expression. *San-sukumi* usually refers to a "three-way standoff" (like snake-frog-slug), but here it's used to describe a woman's physical/sexual allure. It implies a beauty that leaves one paralyzed or speechless.
*   **復員 (Fukuin):** Demobilization. A key term for soldiers returning home after WWII.
*   **ポックリ (Pokkuri):** Onomatopoeia for dying suddenly and unexpectedly.
*   **梶棒 (Kajibō):** The shafts or handles of a hand-pulled cart (*daigoro* or *kuruma*).
*   **半狂亂 (Hankyōran):** Half-crazed or frantic with grief/rage.
*   **虫が知らせた (Mushi ga shirasetta):** Literally "the bug told me." An idiom meaning to have a premonition or a "gut feeling."
*   **爛熟 (Ranjuku):** Over-ripeness. Used here metaphorically for a woman in her prime, often with a slightly decadent or sensual connotation.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Femme Fatale" and Suspicion:** The text sets up a classic mystery/noir trope. The woman (Yoshie) is described as unnervingly youthful and sensual, and she happens to benefit from a life insurance policy that was almost cancelled.
*   **Sudden Death and Fate:** Sasaki’s death is described as "uninspiring" and sudden, contrasting with his previously sturdy health. The "heart paralysis" diagnosis invites reader skepticism.
*   **Post-War Morality:** The breakdown of family structures (widows and widowers) and the struggle to survive economically (managing a shop "with one woman's hand") are central to the tension.
*   **The Frame Narrative:** The story is being told by a character named Mr. Saito to a group of "members." This adds a layer of "bar talk" or "confessional" atmosphere, common in Japanese detective or mystery shorts of the time.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Mystery/Noir.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Insurance Fraud (implied), Sensuality, Sudden Death, Social Scandals, Demobilization.
*   **Era:** late 1940s / early 1950s (Showa 20s).
