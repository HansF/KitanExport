　　　――妾（わたし）はもう充分考（かんが）へて居（を）りますわ。貴方（あなた）も位（ぐらゐ）、いへ、男（をとこ）位（ぐらゐ）なら……
　　　――わ、われる。……もういゝよ。俺（おれ）達（たち）は考（かんが）へよう。
　秋子（あきこ）は其（そ）迄（まで）云（い）つて声（こゑ）を呑（の）む。
（夜（よる）のいとなみに愉（たの）しみと悦（よろこ）びを与（あた）へて呉（く）れない貴方（あなた）――男女（だんぢよ）の喜悦（きえつ）は同権（どうけん）の筈（はず）です）
　さう叫（さけ）びたかつた。だが流石（さすが）に恥（はづ）かしくて云（い）へない。達夫（たつを）は沈黙（ちんもく）する。例（れい）の遠（とほ）い眼（め）ですつと天井（てんじやう）の一（ひと）角（かど）を見（み）上げてゐる。狭（せま）い薄（うす）暗（ぐら）い勝手（かつて）元（もと）で秋子（あきこ）は音（おと）高（たか）く食器（しよくき）を洗（あら）ふ。良人（をつと）の物（もの）憂（う）い欠伸（あくび）を聞（き）き流（なが）して秋子（あきこ）は針（はり）箱（ばこ）を引寄（ひきよ）せる。良人（をつと）の破（やぶ）れた宿下（やどした）の繕（つくろ）ひをすることに。
　秋子（あきこ）の憤（いきどほ）りに近（ちか）い皮肉（ひにく）を感（かん）じ、生（なま）々（なま）しい宿下（やどした）から発（はつ）する達夫（たつを）の体臭（たいしう）に戸（と）迷（まど）ひ乍（なが）ら眉（まゆ）をしかめた儘（まま）の寝（ね）貌（がほ）に、秋子（あきこ）は不意（ふい）に嗚咽（をえつ）のこみ上げるのを感じて狙狙（そそ）する。独（ひと）り取（と）り残（のこ）された俊（しゆん）寛（くわん）の叫（さけ）び声（ごゑ）を、心（こころ）の奥底（をくそこ）の方（はう）で聴（き）いてゐる。秋（あき）の夜長（よなが）の寂（さび）しさ哀（かな）しみが身（み）をさいなむ。
　――今日（けふ）は遅（おそ）くなる……かも知（し）れん。
　黙（だま）々と朝食（てうしよく）を終（を）り、朝（あさ）刊（かん）から眼（め）を上（あ）げて達夫（たつを）は短（みじか）く云（い）ふ。家庭（かてい）の良人（をつと）の顔（かほ）ではなく、会社（くわいしや）の会計（くわいけい）課員（くわゐいん）の面構（つらがま）えと秋子（あきこ）には見（み）える。
　――どうぞ……妾（わたし）も一週間（いつしうかん）程（ほど）母（はは）の処（ところ）へ帰（かへ）ります。そして、ゆつくり考（かんが）へますわ。
　帰（かへ）らせて下（くだ）さい、とは云（い）はない。帰（かへ）る権利（けんり）を持つてゐる口（くち）吻（ぶり）で、昨夜（さくや）遂（つひ）に眠（ねむ）れなかつた眼（め）を血走（ちばし）らせてさう云（い）つて了（しま）ふ。平然（へいぜん）とした態度（たいど）で良人（をつと）を見（み）詰（つ）める。だが畳（たたみ）についた小（こ）膝（ひざ）が細（こま）かく震（ふる）へて仕方（しかた）がない。相手（あいて）の出様（でやう）を待（ま）ち乍（なが）ら唾（つばき）をのみこむ。よし、と良人（をつと）が云（い）へば大変（たいへん）である。夜（よる）もすがら考（かんが）え抜（ぬ）いた筈（はず）の、自分（じぶん）の行末（ゆくすゑ）、身（み）の振方（ふりかた）の結末（けつまつ）は、今（いま）憶（おも）い返（かへ）すと子供（こども）のやうに、良人（をつと）と云（い）ふ柱（はしら）の周（まわ）りをくるくると回（まわ）り舞（ま）つてゐただけだと気付（きづ）く。母（はは）の処（ところ）へとは出（で）任（まか）せの思（おも）い付（つ）きだつた。
　達夫（たつを）は恰（あたか）も予期（よき）してゐたかのやうにさうかい……と無（む）表情（ひようじやう）で応（こた）へて立（た）ち上（あが）つた。

「――私はもう充分考えておりますわ。貴方も……いえ、男なら……」
「――わ、わかる。……もういいよ。俺たちは考えよう。」
秋子はそこまで言って声を呑む。
（夜の営みに愉しみと悦びを与えてくれない貴方――男女の喜悦は同権のはずです）
そう叫びたかった。だが流石に恥ずかしくて言えない。達夫は沈黙する。例の遠い目で、すっと天井の一角を見上げている。狭い薄暗い台所で秋子は音高く食器を洗う。夫の物憂いあくびを聞き流して、秋子は針箱を引き寄せる。夫の破れた下着（肌着）の繕いをすることに。
秋子の憤りに近い皮肉を感じ、生々しい下着から発する達夫の体臭に戸惑いながら、眉をしかめたままの寝顔に、秋子は不意に嗚咽のこみ上げるのを感じて、そわそわする。独り取り残された俊寛の叫び声を、心の奥底の方で聴いている。秋の夜長の寂しさ悲しみが身をさいなむ。
「――今日は遅くなる……かも知れん。」
黙々と朝食を終え、朝刊から目を上げて達夫は短く言う。家庭の夫の顔ではなく、会社の会計課員の面構えと秋子には見える。
「――どうぞ……私も一週間ほど母の所へ帰ります。そして、ゆっくり考えますわ。」
帰らせてください、とは言わない。帰る権利を持っている口ぶりで、昨夜ついに眠れなかった目を血走らせてそう言ってしまう。平然とした態度で夫を見つめる。だが畳についた膝が細かく震えて仕方がない。相手の出方を変えながら唾を飲み込む。「よし」と夫が言えば大変である。夜通し考え抜いたはずの、自分の行く末、身の振り方の結末は、今思い返すと子供のように、夫という柱の周りをくるくると回り舞っていただけだと気付く。母の所へとは出任せの思い付きだった。
達夫はあたかも予期していたかのように「そうかい……」と無表情で答えて立ち上がった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Cold Light**

"—I already sufficiently thinking am. You too, no, if [you are] a man..."
"—Un, understand. ...Enough already. We shall think."
Akiko until that point says and swallows her voice.
(You who does not give pleasure and joy to the nightly activities—joy of men and women should be equal rights)
So she wanted to shout. But as expected, [it was] shameful and she cannot say [it]. Tatsuo remains silent. With that usual distant eye, straight at a corner of the ceiling he is looking up. In the narrow, dim kitchen, Akiko loudly washes dishes. Her husband's weary yawn listening-past, Akiko pulls the needle-box close. To do the mending of the husband's torn underclothing.
Feeling Akiko's irony close to resentment, while being bewildered by Tatsuo's body odor emanating from the raw underclothing, at the sleeping face with brows still knitted, Akiko suddenly feels a sob welling up and becomes restless. The cry of Shunkan who was left behind alone, in the depths of her heart she is listening to. The loneliness and sadness of the long autumn night torments her body.
"—Today [I] will be late... maybe."
Silently finishing breakfast, raising eyes from the morning paper, Tatsuo briefly says. Not the face of a husband at home, but the look of a company accounting clerk, it appears to Akiko.
"—Please do... I also for about one week to my mother's place will return. And, slowly I will think."
"Please let me return," she does not say. With a tone of voice as if holding the right to return, making the eyes that finally could not sleep last night bloodshot, she says it. With a composed attitude she stares at her husband. But her knees placed on the tatami tremble finely and it cannot be helped. While waiting for the opponent's move, she swallows spit. If "Alright" the husband says, it is a big matter. The end of her future and her conduct that she was supposed to have thought through all night, looking back now, like a child, only around the pillar called "husband" was she spinning and dancing, she realizes. To the mother's place was a random, spur-of-the-moment idea.
Tatsuo, as if he had expected it, "Is that so..." with an expressionless [face] replied and stood up.

**Cold Light**

"I have already given this enough thought," Akiko began. "As for you—no, if you consider yourself a man..."
"I... I understand," Tatsuo interrupted. "That’s enough. We’ll both think about it."
Akiko cut herself off, swallowing the rest of her words. 
*You, who gives me neither pleasure nor joy in our nightly life—surely a man and woman have an equal right to that joy,* she wanted to scream. But she could not; the shame was too great. Tatsuo fell into silence, staring vacantly at a corner of the ceiling with that distant look he often wore. In the cramped, dim kitchen, Akiko washed the dishes with unnecessary clatter. Ignoring her husband's weary yawn, she pulled her sewing box toward her to mend his torn undershirt.
As she worked, she felt a bitter irony bordering on resentment. The raw scent of Tatsuo’s body rising from the garment confused her, and looking at his sleeping face—his brow still furrowed even in rest—she felt a sudden sob well up in her throat. Deep in her heart, she seemed to hear the desolate cry of the exiled Shunkan. The lingering loneliness of the long autumn night gnawed at her.
"I’ll be late today... probably," Tatsuo said curtly, finishing his breakfast in silence and looking up from the morning paper. To Akiko, he didn't look like a husband at home, but rather like a cold, detached clerk from a corporate accounting department.
"Please, go ahead," she replied. "I, too, will be returning to my mother's house for about a week. I need time to think things over properly."
She did not say, "Please let me go." She spoke with the tone of someone exercising a right, her eyes bloodshot from a sleepless night as she stared him down with forced composure. Yet, pressed against the tatami, her knees shook uncontrollably. She swallowed hard, waiting for his reaction. If he simply said "Fine," everything would change. She realized then that all the plans for her future she had agonized over all night were, in hindsight, childish—she had merely been circling around the pillar that was her husband. The idea of going to her mother’s had been nothing more than a desperate, spur-of-the-moment bluff.
Tatsuo responded as if he had been expecting it. "Is that so?" he said expressionlessly, and stood up.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is formatted in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left. 
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a classic Mincho typeface characteristic of mid-Showa era printing. Notably, it uses **Historical Kana Orthography** (e.g., *kangaefu* for *kangaeru*, *iu* written as *ifu*) and **Kyujitai** (traditional kanji forms) such as 爲 (為), 寢 (寝), and 體 (体).
*   **Furigana (Ruby):** Extensive use of furigana is present to assist with difficult kanji and to specify readings (e.g., 妾 read as *watashi* instead of *mekake*).
*   **Visual Elements:** A hand-drawn illustration at the top depicts a domestic scene. The woman (Akiko) is shown in the foreground with a look of distress, while the man (Tatsuo) is in the background, appearing detached. This visual hierarchy emphasizes the emotional interiority of the female protagonist.
*   **Structure:** The dialogue is marked with long dashes (―) instead of modern quotation marks (「 」), which was a common stylistic choice in Japanese literature of the early to mid-20th century to indicate a more somber or "literary" tone.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s to early 1950s. The language is formal, and the social dynamics reflect the transitional period of post-war Japan.
*   **Gender Roles & Sexual Agency:** The internal monologue mentioning "equal rights to joy" (男女の喜悦は同権) reflects a burgeoning modern consciousness regarding female sexual satisfaction and agency within marriage, contrasting with the traditional expectation of female endurance (*gaman*).
*   **The Pronoun "Watashi" (妾):** While the kanji 妾 usually means "concubine," in older literary contexts, it was used as a humble first-person pronoun for women, read as *watashi* or *warawa*. Here, it signifies a traditional, somewhat subservient feminine self-identification that contrasts with her inner rebellious thoughts.
*   **Shunkan (俊寛):** The text mentions the "cry of Shunkan." This refers to a famous figure from the *Heike Monogatari* who was exiled to a desolate island. The reference evokes a feeling of profound isolation and being "left behind" emotionally within the marriage.
*   **Post-war Professionalism:** The description of the husband looking like an "accounting clerk" rather than a husband suggests the post-war shift toward the "salaryman" identity, where work-life began to strip away domestic intimacy.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **冷光 (Reikō):** Literally "Cold Light." It implies a sterile, unemotional, or harsh atmosphere, mirroring the state of the marriage.
*   **夜のいとなみ (Yoru no itonami):** A euphemism for sexual intercourse (literally "nightly activities/affairs").
*   **宿下 (Yadoshita):** An older term for undergarments or a light kimono worn as a bathrobe/undershirt.
*   **出任せ (Demakase):** Saying something randomly or without forethought; a bluff or speaking off the cuff.
*   **眉をしかめる (Mayu o shikameru):** To frown or knit one's brows; indicates distress or displeasure.
*   **面構え (Tsuragamae):** A somewhat derogatory or rough way to describe a person's look or "mug."

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Marital Disillusionment:** The core theme is the "coldness" of a marriage that has become a mere social contract. The physical intimacy is unsatisfying, and communication has broken down.
*   **The Interiority of Women:** The text heavily focuses on Akiko's internal struggle—her desire to speak her truth versus the socialized shame that prevents her from doing so.
*   **Identity and Dependency:** Akiko's realization that her "rebellion" (going to her mother's) is just a "circling around the pillar of her husband" suggests a critique of how women's lives were defined entirely by their husbands, making true escape difficult even in thought.
*   **The "Cold" Modernity:** The husband's transformation into a "clerk" suggests that modern economic life contributes to the desiccation of human emotion and domestic warmth.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story (Jun-bungaku style)
*   **Genre:** Domestic Drama, Psychological Realism
*   **Themes:** Marriage, Divorce/Separation, Gender Roles, Sexual Dissatisfaction, Loneliness, Post-war Society
*   **Tone:** Somber, Melancholic, Tense
