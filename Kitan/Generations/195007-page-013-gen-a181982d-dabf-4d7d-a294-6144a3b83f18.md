## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**A Certain Frugal Person’s Pocketbook**

May 4th: To buy an evening paper, instead, I use the one of the person sitting next to me on the train. Expenditure: Zero.
May 7th: To call a taxi due to evening rain, instead, to a passing truck driver, I give one hand-rolled cigarette recycled from picked-up butts and have him give me a ride. Expenditure: Zero.
May 11th: For my wife’s birthday, I give a half-chipped flower pot (however, a thing left behind by the junk man the other day). Expenditure: Zero.
May 15th: Saw a movie for the first time in a while. In the "intended" sense, I looked at the billboard. Expenditure: Zero.
May 18th: Colleague Yamada died, so I am to give condolence money. — Supposed to, but I talk to have it subtracted from the amount for my own future death.
May 20th: For friend Sakamoto’s wedding, I give a flower wreath. However, it was the thing sent by my wife’s family during her birthday the other day. Expenditure: Zero.

**[Strange Stories]**

**Street Recording**
Announcer: "That lady over there, excuse me, but are you a 'wife' [married woman]?"
The lady: "No, I am not."
Announcer: "This was a great rudeness I committed."
A man who was listening: "Um, excuse me—"
Lady: "Huh, is it about me?"
Man: "It is, but... um, I, actually I am single, so if it's alright, would you marry me at this time?"
Lady: "?!?!"

**A Story of Opening the Belly [Frank Talk]**
It was announced by medical authorities that performing appendectomy together at the time of childbirth is the most rational and moreover economical.
In the case of men, a plan came out that having the surgery performed in conjunction with when they "cut the stuffed belly" [take responsibility/commit suicide] upon failure would be killing two birds with one stone, but the "black-bellied" [wicked] sorts strongly refused to agree.

**Twilight Incident**
On a bridge where evening darkness approaches.
A girlfriend and boyfriend leaning on the railing.
Looking, she is applying a white handkerchief to her eye. She is crying. The boyfriend's face is also quite gloomy. Below the bridge, leaden-dark water flows while reflecting the city lights.
"If I have to suffer... this much..."
"Ah (sigh), I'm at a loss. I wonder if there is some good way."
The young couple’s conversation is heard in fragments. It is a considerably worrying scene.
"You, do something quickly. At this rate, my future is pitch black."
What serious words.
"Alright!" He decisively made up his mind. Suddenly, he quickly approached her. His glasses flashed. The two huddled closely together. It's somewhat eerie.
Five seconds... ten seconds... Before long, are the two not appearing quite happy; they started walking with perfectly cheerful synchronized steps.
Hearing later... the cause of her tears was a single speck of dust, and he brought his lips to her eye and took that dust out with his tongue, so they say.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Miser’s Ledger**

**May 4:** Intended to buy the evening paper. Instead, I just read over the shoulder of the man sitting next to me on the train. Total spent: ¥0.
**May 7:** Needed a taxi in the evening rain. Instead, I flagged down a passing truck driver and traded him a single cigarette I’d hand-rolled from discarded butts for a lift. Total spent: ¥0.
**May 11:** For my wife’s birthday, I gave her a half-broken flower pot (it was something a junk dealer had left behind the other day). Total spent: ¥0.
**May 15:** Went to the movies for the first time in ages. By "went," I mean I stood outside and looked at the posters. Total spent: ¥0.
**May 18:** My colleague Yamada passed away. I was expected to provide a condolence gift—however, I’ve asked that they simply deduct it from the amount they’ll owe me when my time comes.
**May 20:** Sent a floral wreath for my friend Sakamoto’s wedding. To be fair, it was the same one my wife’s family sent her for her birthday last week. Total spent: ¥0.

**[Odd Anecdotes]**

**On-the-Spot Interview**
**Announcer:** "Excuse me, ma'am, but are you a 'Wife'?" (implying: are you married?)
**Woman:** "Goodness, no, I am not."
**Announcer:** "Oh, my deepest apologies for the presumption!"
**Eavesdropping Man:** "Excuse me! Hello!"
**Woman:** "Yes? Are you talking to me?"
**Man:** "I am! Er... you see, I'm a bachelor. Since you aren't a 'wife' yet, I was wondering if you might consider marrying me right now?"
**Woman:** "?!?!"

**Gut-Level Gags**
Medical experts have declared that performing an appendectomy during childbirth is the height of logic and economy. 
As for men, a proposal was made that they should have their appendixes out whenever they are forced to "eviscerate themselves" (take the fall) for a failure—killing two birds with one stone. However, the "black-hearted" types (the corrupt) have stubbornly refused to support the measure.

**The Twilight Tragedy**
Dusk falls upon the bridge. A young couple leans against the railing.
She presses a white handkerchief to her eye, sobbing. He looks utterly morose. Below, the murky river water churns, reflecting the neon lights of the city.
"If I have to suffer like this..." she moans.
"God," he sighs, "I'm at the end of my rope. Isn't there anything we can do?"
Their fragmented conversation paints a dire picture.
"You have to do something, and fast! My whole future is going to be ruined at this rate!"
How grim!
"Right!" he says, his mind made up. He lunges toward her, his glasses glinting in the dark. They huddle together, a shadowy, slightly unsettling mass.
Five seconds pass... ten seconds... 
Suddenly, they pull apart, looking radiant! They set off down the street with a cheerful spring in their step.
As it turns out, her "tears" were caused by a speck of dust in her eye, and he had simply leaned in to lick it out for her. The end.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The page is organized into a modular grid, common in Japanese "variety" magazines of the mid-20th century. It features a mix of vertical text columns, boxed features, and small-scale illustrations.
*   **Typography:** The headers use a bold, hand-drawn aesthetic or heavy Ming-style (Minchō) type. The main body text is a standard vertical serif font. The use of older kanji forms (like `處` for `処`, `爲` for `為`, `眞` for `真`) indicates a pre-1946 orthography or a transitional period shortly after the war when older habits persisted in print.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **The Miser's Ledger:** Simple text-heavy list.
    *   **Strange Stories/Twilight Incident:** Accompanied by four-panel-style or floating comic illustrations. The art style is "Heta-uma" (bad-but-good) or early *manga-ga* (comic pictures), typical of satirical magazines like *Van* or *Weekly Sankei*.
    *   **Tsumego:** Standard grid diagrams for the game of Go, placed at the bottom as a "reader participation" feature.
*   **Hierarchy:** The title "A Certain Frugal Person's Pocketbook" dominates the top left, suggesting it's a recurring column. The "Twilight Incident" occupies the largest block of text, designed to look like a serious short story to set up the punchline.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Frugality:** The "Miser's Ledger" reflects the extreme poverty and scarcity of the late 1940s in Japan. Recycling cigarette butts (moku-hiroi) was a common reality, not just a joke. The humor comes from taking actual hardship to a ridiculous, stingy extreme (like asking for a credit on funeral money).
*   **Street Recordings (Gaitō Rokon):** This was a popular NHK radio program (started in 1946) where announcers interviewed people on the street about their lives and opinions. The joke parodies the awkwardness of these public interactions.
*   **Honorifics (Okusama):** The announcer asks if she is an "Okusama" (Wife/Madam). In that era, calling a woman "Okusama" was both a respectful address and a query about her marital status. The man's sudden proposal highlights the post-war "marriage craze" and the bluntness of the era's humor.
*   **Go (Igo) Culture:** Go has always been a staple of Japanese intellectual life. Including "Tsumego" (Go puzzles) in a general interest magazine shows the game's ubiquity across social classes.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **小使帖 (Koshizukai-chō):** An old term for a pocketbook or an allowance ledger.
*   **間合わす (Ma-awasu):** To make do with; to manage with what is at hand.
*   **屑屋 (Kuzu-ya):** A rag-and-bone man or junk dealer.
*   **香典 (Kōden):** Traditional Japanese funeral offering of money.
*   **妾 (Atai):** A feminine first-person pronoun. While originally used by geisha or in certain dialects, in mid-century fiction, it often signaled a certain "feisty" or urban feminine character.
*   **詰め腹を切る (Tsumebara o kiru):** Literally "to be forced to commit seppuku." Idiomatically, it means to be forced to take responsibility for a failure, often by resigning.
*   **腹が黒い (Hara ga kuroi):** Literally "black-bellied." Idiomatically: wicked, scheming, or corrupt.
*   **ドス黒い (Dosu-guroi):** A very dark, murky, or leaden color (often used for dirty river water).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Satire of the "Salaryman" Life:** The text pokes fun at the social obligations (weddings, funerals) and the financial strain they place on the average worker.
*   **Misdirection as Humor:** Both the "Street Recording" and "Twilight Incident" rely on subverting expectations. The "Twilight Incident" sets up a classic "Shinju" (double suicide) trope—a couple on a bridge in despair—only to reveal it's a mundane physical annoyance (dust in the eye).
*   **Skepticism of Authority:** The "Frank Talk" segment uses medical "rationality" to mock politicians or businessmen ("black-bellied types") who avoid taking responsibility for their failures.
*   **Resilience through Humour:** The miser's story turns the grim reality of post-war poverty into a game of wits, suggesting a cultural coping mechanism through laughter.
