女體愛の秘儀

私は東京の某大學に在學する二十歳の男であります。
幼い頃より私の性癖は特異な方向に伸びて行きました。
姉の使ひ古した肌着や、母の洗つたばかりの襦袢の紐などが、
私にとつては強い愛の象徴でありました。
特に、下着を盜み見るときの緊張感、そしてそれを口に含んで
をります時の、魂がぬけさうな背徳的な陶酔は忘れられません。
最近、遂に友人の妹君に催眠術をかけて、自らの意志で、
着てゐた絹のストッキングを脱がせ、それを愛玩する
といふ行為に及びました。
斯かる私の行爲は、やはり精神病と云ふべきものでありませうか？
（T・I生、千代田區）

## Literal English Translation
(Margin Note: To the Sex Psychology Counseling Room)

The Secret Rites of Love for the Female Body

I am a twenty-year-old male attending a certain university in Tokyo.
Since childhood, my sexual inclination has developed in a peculiar direction.
My older sister's worn-out undergarments, and the ties of my mother's freshly washed *juban* (kimono slip),
were for me symbols of strong love.
Especially, the tension felt when secretly glimpsing the underwear, and the immoral ecstasy,
as if my soul were slipping away, when I held it in my mouth, I cannot forget.
Recently, I finally placed a friend's younger sister under hypnosis, and by her own will,
had her remove the silk stockings she was wearing, and proceeded to engage in the act of fondling/cherishing them.
Should such an act of mine, after all, be called a mental illness?
(T.I., Student, Chiyoda Ward)

## Literary English Translation
(Note: For the Sexual Psychology Counseling Column)

The Esoteric Ritual of Somatic Love

I am a twenty-year-old student enrolled at a university in Tokyo.
From my earliest years, my sexual proclivities began to evolve in a very distinctive manner.
My elder sister’s worn underclothes, or the drawstrings of my mother’s newly laundered *juban*, became for me potent symbols of affection.
I can never forget the tension I felt when secretly spying on this underwear, nor the profound, sinful rapture—a feeling that my very soul was escaping—experienced while holding them in my mouth.
Recently, I finally managed to induce a state of hypnosis in the younger sister of a friend, compelling her to willingly remove the silk stockings she was wearing, which I then proceeded to fetishistically indulge in.
Should this behavior of mine truly be classified as a mental disorder?
(T.I., Student, Chiyoda Ward)

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Letter / Sexual Confession (性癖告白) submitted to a dedicated advice or counseling column (性心理相談室). This format was typical for *Kitan Club*, blending personal testimony with pseudo-clinical inquiry.
*   **Author Attribution:** Pseudonymous (T・I生), indicating a student in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo. This anonymity facilitates highly taboo confessions.
*   **Narrator Voice:** Confessional, analytical, highly self-aware of the abnormality ("特異な方向," "背徳的"). The voice positions the behavior as a clinical case requiring expert diagnosis (精神病).
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in the psychological pathologies of sexuality (*Sei Shinri*), emphasizing educated, urban deviants.
*   **Thematic Progression:** The narrative establishes a clear progression: 1) Childhood fetishistic origins (mother/sister), 2) Passive consumption (oral fixation/voyeurism), and 3) Active, coercive escalation (hypnosis).

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Postwar Sexuality:** The text reflects the explosion of public discourse on sexual deviations (*seiheki*) in post-war Japan (1950s-60s), facilitated by the relative liberalization following the Occupation, often framed through pop psychology.
*   **Setting and Class:** Mentioning "Tokyo university" and "Chiyoda Ward" signals the narrator belongs to the intellectual, middle-to-upper class. This juxtaposition of high social status and low, taboo desires is a standard trope in ero-guro literature.
*   **The *Juban* and Stockings:** The fetish objects transition from the traditional (mother's *juban* ties, linked to pre-war dress) to the modern (sister's *hadagi*, friend's silk stockings, representing Westernized femininity and high fashion). Silk stockings (often associated with US GIs and the eroticization of Western attire) are particularly potent fetish objects of the era.
*   **Hypnosis (催眠術):** In this era of sensational reporting, hypnosis was frequently utilized in narratives to explain away coercion or non-consent, providing a convenient, pseudo-scientific tool for controlling sexual subjects. The phrase "自らの意志で" (by her own will) attempts to maintain a veneer of control/consent, even though induced.
*   **"背徳的な陶酔" (Immoral Ecstasy):** This phrase perfectly encapsulates the ero-guro blend: pleasure derived specifically from the breach of moral boundaries and societal taboos.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **女體愛の秘儀 (Jotai-ai no Higi):** The phrase elevates simple fetishism into a profound, almost mystical "secret rite," lending gravity and sensationalism to the act.
*   **性癖 (Seiheki):** Used technically to mean "sexual inclination," but historically carries a strong connotation of abnormality or perversion, akin to the English "deviance" or "perversion."
*   **襦袢の紐 (Juban no Himo):** The drawstring ties of the kimono slip; this specificity focuses the fetish not just on the garment, but on the element that binds or secures the body.
*   **口に含んでをります (Kuchi ni fukunde orimasu):** "Holding it in my mouth." Suggests oral fixation and a deep sensory consumption of the fetish object.
*   **愛玩する (Aigan suru):** "To cherish/fondle." A euphemistic term for deriving sexual gratification from handling an object; highly suggestive in this context.
*   **精神病 (Seishinbyō):** Mental illness/psychosis. Reflects the era's clinical focus on diagnosing and classifying sexual pathology.

## Themes & Subtext
*   **Sexual Escalation:** The core narrative arc is the progression from passive voyeurism and self-stimulation (with family objects) to active manipulation and coercion of a third party (the friend’s sister).
*   **Control and Power:** The use of hypnosis is the ultimate fantasy of control, allowing the subject to fulfill his deepest taboo desires while framing the victim's actions as self-willed.
*   **The Shame/Pleasure Loop:** The narrator's pleasure is inseparable from the sense of transgression ("背徳的な陶酔"). The fear of classification as "mental illness" validates the extremity of his desire.
*   **Objectification:** The female body (represented by the sister/mother, and then the friend's sister) is completely reduced to the objects covering it (underwear, stockings). The narrator cares only for the material object, not the person.

## Content Classification Tags
*   Sexual content: High (Fetishism, partialism, oral fixation)
*   Violence: Low
*   Coercion: Medium-High (Explicit use of hypnosis/manipulation to obtain sexual objects)
*   Medical / bodily themes: High (References to "sexual psychology" and "mental illness")
*   Taboo or illegal implications: High (Manipulation, theft/handling of private garments)
