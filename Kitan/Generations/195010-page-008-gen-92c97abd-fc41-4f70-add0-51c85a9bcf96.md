## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

孫娘らしいのを連れた腰の曲つた皺だらけの婆さん、背中一面に灸の痕があつて、皮膚の色の黒く濁つた年増女、外に女の気はなかつた。彼は見たくもないものを見せられたやうに、チッと言って眼を閉じた。

**七**
さうしてつまらなささうに、掌のひらへ手拭をのせて、浴槽の中でベロンとひとつ顔を洗つた。
それにしても、此の前、賓命湯で逢った女の身体は全く美事だつた。均整のとれた全体の筋肉がさつくびき緊つてゐて刻みたての茹玉子のやうに光澤があつた。

**八**
七の阿娜（あだ）めいた女が流しの方へ、背後を向けてスル……と帯を解いてゐた。

**九**
そんな事を考へて湯を出てあがるつもりで岡湯（をかゆ）を浴びてゐると、頭髪を孀（そく）巻にして、袷（あはせ）の下へ派手な浴衣を着た用心棒（をんな）でもあるらしい二十六

**十**
それを眼早く見た藤兵衛は再び浴槽に飛び込んで隅の方へうづくまりながら、繊奇に満ちた眼をみはつてその女の肉体を見つめてゐた。その女が着物を脱ぎ終つて、いそいそと、柘榴口（ざくろぐち）へ近づくまでに、彼はその全身を鑑賞する事が出来た。無意識らしく装つて、その傍へ近づきかけると、丁度その時女は浴槽を出た。彼は再び機会を待たねばならなかつた。
二度目は女は続いてその後にからすぐ浴槽へ入つた。最初から有利な立場にあつたので、すぐ仕事にとりかかるには、きはめて容易であつた。

**十一**
手馴れた順序で、慣れきつた方法を用ひて首尾よく、女の手拭は彼の掌に移つた。
あまりそれが、無雑作に成功したので、なんだかあつけな過ぎるとも思はれた。
その翌日も、時刻をはかつて彼は丁字湯へ行った。その日も昨夜の女に會つて、昨日と同じ順序でその手拭を得ることが出来た。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

An old woman with a bent back covered in wrinkles leading what looked like her granddaughter; a mature woman with moxibustion scars all over her back and dark, muddy-colored skin—there were no other signs of women. He, as if shown something he didn't want to see, said "Tch" and closed his eyes.

**7**
And so, appearing bored, he put a towel on his palm and gave his face a quick wash inside the bathtub.
Even so, the body of the woman he met before at Hinmei-yu was truly magnificent. The muscles of her whole well-proportioned body were tightly drawn, having a luster like a freshly peeled boiled egg.

**8**
The coquettish woman from [section] seven, toward the drainage area, turned her back and "suru..." [sliding sound] untied her obi.

**9**
While thinking of such things and intending to leave the bath and taking a rinse-water (okayu), [he saw] a woman around twenty-six who looked like a bodyguard, with her hair in a *sokumaki* style, wearing a flashy yukata under a lined kimono...

**10**
Fujibei, seeing that quickly, again jumped into the bathtub and while crouching in the corner, stared with eyes full of curiosity at that woman's flesh. By the time that woman finished undressing and briskly approached the *zakuro-guchi* (low bath entrance), he was able to appreciate her whole body. Pretending to be unconscious [unaware], as he started to approach her side, just at that time the woman left the bathtub. He had to wait for another chance.
The second time, he entered the bathtub immediately following the woman. Since he was in a favorable position from the start, it was extremely easy to set about the "work."

**11**
In a practiced order, using a well-accustomed method, successfully, the woman's towel moved to his palm.
Because that succeeded so casually, he thought it was somewhat too easy.
The next day as well, timing it right, he went to Choji-yu. That day too he met the woman from the previous night, and in the same order as yesterday, was able to obtain that towel.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

There was only a wizened old woman with a bent back, accompanied by her granddaughter, and a middle-aged woman whose skin was darkened and marred by moxibustion scars across her back. Finding no other women of interest, he clicked his tongue in annoyance and closed his eyes, as if repulsed by the sight.

**7**
With a bored air, he laid a towel across his palm and gave his face a perfunctory splash in the bath. He couldn't help but recall the woman he’d seen recently at the Hinmei-yu bathhouse. Her body had been exquisite—her proportions were perfect, her muscles taut and firm, with a radiant sheen like a freshly peeled hard-boiled egg.

**8**
The alluring woman from the previous scene turned her back toward the wash area and began to slide her obi loose.

**9**
Lost in these thoughts while taking a final rinse before leaving, he spotted a woman of about twenty-six. She wore her hair in a high bun and sported a loud yukata beneath her kimono; she had the rugged air of a female bodyguard...

**10**
Fujibei, quick to notice her, dove back into the tub. Crouching in a corner, he fixed his leering gaze upon her naked form. He feasted his eyes on her until she finished undressing and hurried toward the low entrance of the inner bath. Feigning indifference, he tried to edge closer, but she stepped out of the water just as he approached. He would have to wait for another opening.
On the second attempt, he slipped into the water immediately after her. Positioned perfectly from the start, it was a simple matter to begin his "work."

**11**
With practiced precision and his usual technique, he successfully snatched the woman's towel into his hand. It happened so effortlessly that it felt almost anticlimactic.
The following day, he timed his visit to the Choji-yu bathhouse perfectly. He encountered the same woman again and, following the exact same routine as the night before, managed to make off with her towel once more.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a multi-panel layout typical of mid-century Japanese magazines. Illustrations are integrated with text blocks, which are numbered (7 through 11) to guide the reader through the narrative sequence.
*   **Typography:** The text uses traditional vertical layout (*tate-gaki*). The font is a standard Mincho style typical of the printing technology of the late 1940s/50s.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustrations dominate the page, serving as the primary draw for the reader. The text functions as a "caption story" or a serialized novella. The use of numbers (六, 七, 八, 九, 十, 十一) suggests this is part of a longer "how-to" or "adventure" series regarding voyeurism or petty theft.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Furigana (reading aids) are used for difficult or specific kanji like "阿娜" (ada), "孀巻" (sokumaki), and "柘榴口" (zakuroguchi), indicating a general but perhaps not highly scholarly audience.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** This term refers to the explosion of cheap, pulp magazines in Japan immediately following WWII (1945–1950s). They were named after a low-grade shochu that "left you with a hangover after three cups," much like these magazines were said to be "done after three issues." They focused on "3S" (Sex, Screen, Sports) and provided escapism.
*   **Sento (Public Baths):** Public baths were central to daily life in post-war Japan as many homes lacked private baths. The "Zakuro-guchi" (柘榴口) mentioned in the text refers to the low, dark entrance to the bathtub area in Edo-style bathhouses, designed to keep steam in.
*   **Mixed Bathing (Konyoku):** While mixed bathing was officially banned during the Meiji era, the voyeuristic theme here suggests either a clandestine mixed-bath setting or a protagonist who has sneaked into the women's side (common tropes in erotic literature of the era).
*   **Moxibustion (Kyu):** The mention of "moxibustion scars" (灸の痕) on the old woman highlights a common traditional medical practice. In erotic literature, such details are often used to contrast "unattractive" or "aged" bodies with the idealized "boiled egg" skin of the younger female subjects.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **阿娜 (Ada/Ana):** An archaic term for being coquettish, alluring, or charming in a feminine way.
*   **孀巻 (Sokumaki):** A specific hairstyle, often associated with mature women or those in specific trades, where the hair is coiled.
*   **柘榴口 (Zakuro-guchi):** Literally "Pomegranate Mouth." This was a feature of traditional Japanese baths where the entrance to the tub was a small, low opening to prevent heat loss.
*   **岡湯/上がり湯 (Okayu/Agari-yu):** Rinse water used after coming out of the main tub to wash off any dirt from the communal water.
*   **藤兵衛 (Fujibei):** A quintessential "commoner" name from the Edo period, often used in pulp fiction to give the protagonist a "rogue" or "everyman" feel.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and Fetishism:** The primary theme is the male gaze and the thrill of observing women in a semi-private space. The "theft" of the towel acts as a surrogate for sexual contact or a trophy of the voyeuristic act.
*   **Aesthetics of the Body:** There is a heavy emphasis on the contrast between "ugly" bodies (the wrinkled grandmother, the scarred middle-aged woman) and the "perfect" body (the target of his affection). The "boiled egg" metaphor is a classic Japanese trope for smooth, pale skin.
*   **Post-War Libido:** This type of content represents a shift in post-war Japan toward the "open" expression of desire, often termed *nikutai bungaku* (flesh literature), which rejected the wartime austerity and focused on physical sensation and individual impulse.
