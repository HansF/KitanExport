**一夜（ひとよ）の戯（たわむ）れ**
**岸本俊次**

少し斜視（がちゃめ）がゝった美しい眼で、じつと正面からみつめられて
「あなた、川本さんておっしゃるのね」
とやられた時には、ボク、ちょっとマゴついたのだった。
盛り場裏のボクの行きつけの酒場の女・蘭子といっていた。
ボクの好きなタイプで、いう迄もなくボクのいわゆるお眼当ての女だったのだ。
ボクがキョトンとしたのは、ほんの瞬間だった。
「はゝあん、そうか」
とばかり、すっかり合点がいっていた。
というのは、丁度その日、ボクは、ボクの友人で川本という男の戸籍抄本を依託されてそれを、レインコートのポケットに入れておいた事を思い出したのだ。
川本はボクと違って完全な独身者だった。その独身者の川本なる男の戸籍抄本を脱いでおいたボクのレインコートのポケットの中に発見したことによって、蘭子が、それを、ボク自身の戸籍抄本と間違えて、
（あら、この人は川本さんていうのよ、それにまあ、独り身だわ）
と感嘆したという結果になる。
さあ、それからというものは、俄然この蘭子なる女性のボクに対する眼の色が違ってきた。
「あたし、こんな生活、早く清算したいのよ」
ぴたりと寄り添うようにして彼女はいとゝ物思わしげなのである。
「あたし、結婚したいのよ」
しんみりと眼を温ませて、
「あたいの母さん、……随分あたいのこと心配してたのよ。お前が立派な御亭主を持つまでは死んでも死に切れないつて」
「フーン、……で君のお母さんは？」
ボクとしても大いに調子を合せる。
「死んでしまったわ、去年の秋……」
「可哀相な女なんだね、君は――」
「そうなの、……あたしと母さんは、あたいの小さい時に、父さんの家から追い出されたんだわ。それにはとっても複雑な事情があるのよ。あんた、聴いてくれる？」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**One Night's Frolic**
**Kishimoto Shunji**

With beautiful eyes that were slightly cross-eyed, being stared at fixedly from the front,
"You are called Mr. Kawamoto, aren't you?"
When [I] was hit with that, I, a little bit was confused.
The woman of my usual bar behind the entertainment district—she was called Ranko.
She was my favorite type, and it goes without saying she was my so-called "target" woman.
My being blank-faced was only for a moment.
"Aha, I see,"
Thinking just that, I completely understood.
That is to say, exactly on that day, I, by a friend of mine, a man named Kawamoto, had been entrusted with a family register transcript, and remembered that I had put it in my raincoat pocket.
Kawamoto, unlike me, was a complete bachelor. By finding the family register transcript of that man called Kawamoto who is a bachelor inside the pocket of my raincoat which I had taken off, Ranko, mistaking that for my own family register transcript,
(Oh, this person is called Mr. Kawamoto, and what's more, he's single)
The result was that she marveled.
Well, from then on, suddenly the color of this woman Ranko’s eyes toward me changed.
"I, this kind of life, want to settle/end quickly."
Pressing close to me, she was very much lost in thought.
"I want to get married."
Somberly making her eyes warm/moist,
"My mother... she worried about me quite a lot. Until you have a fine husband, I can't die even if I die, she said."
"Hmm... and your mother?"
I also greatly matched the tone.
"She died, last autumn..."
"You are a pitiful woman, aren't you—"
"That's right... me and mother, when I was small, were kicked out of father's house. There are very complicated circumstances for that. You, will you listen?"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**A Night’s Dalliance**
**By Shunji Kishimoto**

When she fixed me with those beautiful, slightly wandering eyes and said, “So, your name is Mr. Kawamoto, isn't it?” I’ll admit I was caught off guard. 

She was Ranko, a girl at my favorite haunt tucked away behind the entertainment district. She was exactly my type—the one I’d had my eye on for some time. My confusion lasted only a second before the realization hit me. *Aha, I get it.*

You see, just that day, a friend named Kawamoto had asked me to hold onto a copy of his family register, and I’d tucked it into my raincoat pocket. Unlike me, Kawamoto was a confirmed bachelor. Ranko must have peeked into the pocket of the coat I’d taken off, found the document, and assumed it was mine. *“Oh, so his name is Kawamoto,”* she must have thought, *“and look, he’s single!”*

From that moment on, the look in Ranko’s eyes changed completely. She pressed herself against me, acting suddenly pensive. 

“I want to get out of this life soon,” she murmured, clinging to my side. “I want to get married.” Her eyes grew misty with sentiment. “My mother… she worried about me so much. She used to say she couldn’t rest in peace until she saw me settled with a good husband.”

“I see… and where is your mother now?” I asked, playing along with her mood.

“She passed away last autumn.”

“You’ve had a hard time of it, haven't you?”

“I have… My mother and I were kicked out of my father’s house when I was just a little girl. It’s a very complicated story. Would you… would you be willing to listen?”

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses traditional Japanese vertical right-to-left orientation. The main story occupies the top and middle sections, while a "Questions and Answers" (Q&A) section is framed at the bottom.
*   **Typography:** The title "一夜の戯れ" uses a bold, slightly stylized typeface. The body text is a standard serif font typical of mid-century printing.
*   **Illustration:** There is a hand-drawn illustration titled "Rendezvous Kitan" (ランデブー・きたん), featuring a sketch of a nude woman. This is a hallmark of the *Kasutori* genre, which blended literature with mild erotica.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and author's name are prominent. The Q&A section is clearly demarcated with a different border style, indicating a recurring column or a lighter sidebar.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is organized into long vertical columns, which is standard for Japanese magazines.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (1950s):** This text likely comes from a "Kasutori" magazine. The term "Kasutori" refers to a low-quality dregs-based shochu, and these magazines were so named because they were said to "make you go bad after three issues" (or three cups). They were popular in the post-war era, providing cheap entertainment, gossip, and erotic fiction to the masses.
*   **Koseki Shohon (Family Register Transcript):** In Japan, the *koseki* is a vital legal document. During this era, carrying a physical transcript was common for administrative tasks. The plot device of a woman finding a man's *koseki* and checking his marital status reflects the social importance of lineage and legal marriage status in mid-century Japan.
*   **"Sakariba" (Entertainment Districts):** The setting is a bar in a back alley of a nightlife district. This reflects the burgeoning urban culture of post-war Japan where "bars" and "cabarets" were primary social hubs for men.
*   **Post-War Social Struggles:** Ranko’s backstory (being kicked out of her father's house, her mother's death) reflects common post-war tropes of poverty and the precarious life of women working in the entertainment industry.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **斜視 (Gachame):** An older, somewhat derogatory term for strabismus (cross-eyedness). In this context, it's used as a charm point or a distinctive physical trait.
*   **マゴついた (Magotsuita):** To be flustered or confused.
*   **お眼当て (Omeyate):** One's "target" or the person one is interested in.
*   **合点がいった (Gatten ga itta):** To fully understand or have the pieces click together.
*   **戸籍抄本 (Koseki Shohon):** An official transcript of a family register.
*   **清算 (Seisan):** Literally "liquidation" or "settling accounts." In the context of lifestyle, it means to "clean up" one's act, leave a shady job, or break off an old relationship.
*   **あたい (Atai):** A slangy, informal female first-person pronoun, often associated with working-class women or "bad girls" of the Shōwa era.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Deception and Mistaken Identity:** The story revolves around a "white lie" or a misunderstanding that the narrator chooses to maintain. This suggests a theme of the performative nature of urban nightlife—everyone is playing a role.
*   **Melodrama vs. Reality:** Ranko's sudden shift to a tragic backstory ("My mother died... we were kicked out") is a classic rhetorical strategy used in bars to elicit sympathy (and money) from customers. The narrator's internal monologue ("Aha, I see") shows he is cynical and aware of the game, yet he chooses to "play along" (*choushi o awaseru*).
*   **Humor and Satire:** The Q&A section at the bottom provides a satirical counterpoint to the sentimental story above. It treats "kissing etiquette" with ridiculous seriousness, providing a humorous "safety guide" for men navigating the dating world.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story), Satire/Humor (Q&A).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Romance, Nightlife, Urban life, Deception, Post-war Japan, Erotica (soft), Etiquette.
*   **Classification:** Entertainment / Pulp Fiction.
