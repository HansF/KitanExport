**Abnormal First-Stage Patient**
**Yuge Shinobu**

In the world, at public seats or during ordinary social intercourse, even those who wear a face that wouldn't kill even a very serious insect, if one step their reverse side private life is exposed, one is startled that there are many who are living unexpected abnormal lives.
While some people say such things as "dual personality," for me such difficult academic words I do not understand, but even regarding the story I am about to tell from now, if general people who have no experience in such things heard it, regarding those suspicious, curiosity-seeking strange actions, I think they would likely harbor the doubt of "isn't that a lie?"
However, though this is an embarrassing story, because it is a confessional-style tale of myself, that it is not a lie is certain.
Speaking of the place where I live, if I say it is the next station if one boards the train from Namba on the Nankai Line, you would likely understand, but if one hears only names like Nishihagi Shoen, Rakuen, Hikifune-so, Korakuen, Seifu-so, etc., it is a neighborhood where indeed grand apartments are standing.
I was renting the second floor of an apartment that looked slightly better in appearance in this vicinity where mistresses, dancers, and sometimes high-class courtesans nest, which I call Matsuya House.
I, who mainly eat at diners using food tickets, have no bother of cooking for myself, and what I like best about it is that at the end of the second-floor hallway, from my room, I could go outside by swinging over the concrete wall and following the iron emergency ladder.
For that reason, when it was for going to work or returning home, I entered and exited from that apartment's entrance, but at other times, I mainly utilized that emergency ladder.
I forgot to say, but since I work at a certain cosmetics wholesaler in the city, from roughly 8:30 AM until about 5:00 PM in the evening, every day except Sunday, I go to work to do that place's job. Due to the relationship of doing something like being the raw materials purchasing clerk, even if I sometimes go on business trips, I usually return in about one week.
In the apartment, I passed for a serious young man, and due to the relationship of eating out, I was not a person who associated very closely with others, and hating being glanced at by energetic older women, even walking the hallway was rare.
If put this way, it is an extremely ordinary, common salaryman life, but from some time, I had contracted a disease called insomnia where I could only sleep two or three hours every night.
The scene of being all alone in a silent apartment room with wide-awake eyes is not a very pleasant sight. However, strangely, despite being unable to sleep only two or three hours at night like that, the next morning I was not sleepy at all, and also was not tired.
An early summer evening when such things had continued for about a week—yes, it was the year of Showa 21, the first year after the end of the war. I got down from my bed, opened the window, and gazed outside. Fortunately, because this vicinity mostly remained unburnt, the roofs of private houses were layered like pitch-black monsters. Only the lights of Namba Station to the north could be seen flickering faintly; it was almost pitch black.
Especially towards the directions where war damage was severe, I felt as if some terrifying demonic energy was approaching, and the light that occasionally flared up was like the souls of dead people and felt eerie.
Gazing over the town's roofs for even a short time like this, I exercise my delusions about what kind of things are being carried out every night under these roofs. Then, struck by a kind of unspeakable strange feeling, my body suddenly became light, and when I realized it, wings had grown on both shoulders and I was flying.
While being attacked by such weird feelings every night, I actually began to slip out of my room in a daze.
There is something called a somnambulist. Is it that kind of disease? Anyway, because I could descend to the side alley via the iron ladder from my room, to the apartment people of course and other people too, my suspicious night actions ended up without being known.
That ladder, they say it was used during times like air raid drills, but after the end of the war it was no longer used and was completely forgotten by people, and conveniently, the wooden fence of the two-story building on the opposite side was pressing close to the tip of my nose so that it was within reach if I extended my hand.
First, I went back and forth on busy streets; as you know, through the bustle of Tobita Daimon-dori to Shinsekai, Shinsaibashi, Abeno-hashi, and finally the black markets in front of Osaka Station, I wandered around with no purpose. At that time, it was the peak period of the black markets that flourished after the war, so one could walk around even through the night.
However, looking back on it now, at this time it was still only the first-stage symptoms of my disease...

**The Abnormal: A First-Stage Patient**
**By Shinobu Yuge**

In this world, even those who appear as the most upright citizens in public or during social functions—individuals who look as if they wouldn't hurt a fly—often lead surprisingly abnormal private lives. One would be astonished to see what lies beneath the surface.
Some might call such people "dual personalities." I don't care much for such complex, academic jargon, but I suspect that if an ordinary person with no experience in these matters were to hear the story I am about to tell, they would likely doubt my words, viewing my suspicious and bizarrely voyeuristic behavior as nothing more than a fabrication.
However, though it is a shameful tale, this is my own confession; you can be certain it is no lie.
As for where I live, if I tell you it is the station following Namba on the Nankai Line, you will likely know the area. It is a neighborhood filled with apartments bearing grand names like Nishihagi Shoen, Rakuen, and Seifu-so. I rented a second-floor room in a place called "Matsuya House"—a building that looked slightly more respectable than the rest in a district teeming with mistresses, cabaret dancers, and high-class prostitutes.
Since I relied on food tickets and ate almost exclusively at diners, I was spared the hassle of cooking. My favorite feature of the room, however, was its location at the end of the second-floor hallway. I could slip out by climbing over the concrete wall and descending an iron fire escape. Because of this, while I used the main entrance for my daily commute, I utilized that emergency ladder for almost everything else.
I should mention that I am employed by a cosmetics wholesaler in the city. Aside from Sundays, I work from 8:30 in the morning until 5:00 in the evening as a raw materials clerk. Occasionally, I go on business trips, but I am usually back within a week.
At the apartment, I passed for a serious young man. Because I ate out, I didn't socialize with the other tenants. I despised the lingering gazes of the energetic older women in the building, so I rarely even walked through the hallways.
On the surface, it was a perfectly mundane, ordinary life for a salaryman. Yet, at some point, I fell victim to a form of insomnia—a condition where I could manage only two or three hours of sleep a night.
There is little to see in the image of a man sitting alone in a silent room, eyes wide and alert in the dead of night. But strangely, despite the lack of sleep, I never felt tired the next morning; I remained perfectly awake.
One early summer evening, about a week into this condition—it was 1946, a year after the war ended—I got out of bed and opened the window to gaze outside. Fortunately, this particular neighborhood had escaped the firebombing, and the roofs of the surrounding houses huddled together like pitch-black monsters. To the north, the lights of Namba Station flickered faintly; otherwise, it was absolute darkness.
In the direction of the areas that had been devastated by the air raids, I felt a terrifying, demonic aura. The occasional flickers of light in the distance felt like the restless souls of the dead.
Staring out over the rooftops for a while, I found myself indulging in wild fantasies about what might be happening beneath those eaves every night. Struck by an indescribable, bizarre sensation, my body suddenly felt weightless. Before I knew it, I felt as if wings had sprouted from my shoulders and I was flying.
As these strange sensations plagued me night after night, I actually began to wander out of my room in a daze.
Perhaps it was a form of somnambulism. In any case, because I could sneak down the iron ladder into the side alley, my nightly excursions remained a secret from both my neighbors and the public. The ladder had been used during air raid drills but had been forgotten by everyone since the war ended. Conveniently, the wooden fence of the neighboring building was so close I could almost touch it.
I began to wander aimlessly through the crowded streets: from Tobita Daimon-dori to Shinsekai, Shinsaibashi, Abeno-hashi, and even into the chaotic black markets in front of Osaka Station. It was the golden age of the post-war black markets, and one could walk the streets all night long.
Yet, looking back now, these were merely the first-stage symptoms of my affliction...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The text is presented in a multi-column vertical format typical of Japanese magazines. The title "变態第一期病患者" is written in a large, stylized, slightly hand-drawn font that evokes a sense of mystery or "ero-guro" (erotic grotesque).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and author's name are prominent on the right side. A small illustration of a reclining, semi-nude woman in a western-style pose is placed at the top right, a common trope in "Kasutori" magazines to attract male readers.
*   **Formatting:** The text uses historical orthography (Kyujitai kanji and historical kana usage), though it is relatively modern for the 1940s. It features indentation for new paragraphs and specific markers like "昭和二十一年のことでした" to ground the narrative in a specific time.
*   **Physical Context:** The page number "13" is visible at the bottom, centered between dashes. The paper texture suggests low-quality pulp paper, which has aged and yellowed, with visible ink bleed and speckling.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Showa 21 (1946):** This is the immediate aftermath of WWII. Japan was under Allied occupation (GHQ). The setting is Osaka, specifically areas that survived the firebombing (like parts of the Nankai line/Tengachaya area) versus those that were leveled.
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** The content and style (mentioning "abnormality," mistresses, and dancers, accompanied by a nude illustration) are hallmarks of *Kasutori-zasshi*. These were cheap, pulp magazines that flourished between 1946 and 1950, focusing on the "3S" (Screen, Sex, Sports) and the "ero-guro" tradition.
*   **Food Tickets (外食券 - Gaishokuken):** During and after the war, the rationing system meant people needed tickets to eat at restaurants. Living in an apartment and eating out using these tickets was a common lifestyle for single urban workers (salarymen).
*   **Black Markets (闇市 - Yami-ichi):** The narrator mentions the bustle of the black markets. These were the economic heart of post-war Japan where food and goods were traded outside of official rations.
*   **Geography:** The locations mentioned (Namba, Shinsekai, Shinsaibashi, Abeno, Tobita) are all iconic landmarks in Osaka. Tobita, in particular, was a famous red-light district, adding to the "shameful" and "underground" tone of the narrator's nocturnal walks.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **变態 (Hentai):** In this era, it didn't just mean "pervert" in the modern sexual sense but referred more broadly to "abnormality," "metamorphosis," or psychological deviation.
*   **アブノーマル (Abunōmaru):** Loanword for "abnormal." The use of Katakana loanwords for psychological states was becoming popular in post-war literature.
*   **耽奇的 (Tankiteki):** Seeking the strange or bizarre; curious about oddities.
*   **お妾 (Omekake):** A mistress or concubine.
*   **高瀅 (Kōei?):** Likely a typo or archaic term for high-class prostitutes or "Takao" (courtesans). Given the context of dancers and mistresses, it refers to women in the "water trade" (nightlife).
*   **鬼気 (Kiki):** A ghastly or demonic atmosphere; a feeling of impending doom or ghostly presence.
*   **夢遊病者 (Muyūbyōsha):** A somnambulist or sleepwalker.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Trauma:** The narrator's insomnia and hallucinations (seeing wings, feeling demonic energy from ruins) are clear symptoms of post-war PTSD. The "pitch-black monsters" of the roofs and the "souls of the dead" reflecting in the lights of the ruins illustrate the psychological scarring of the population.
*   **Urban Anomie & Duality:** The core theme is the "dual personality"—the gap between the "serious salaryman" and the "nighttime wanderer." This reflects the societal tension in a rebuilding Japan where people had to maintain a facade of normalcy while dealing with the chaos of the ruins and the black markets.
*   **Voyeurism & Escapism:** The narrator's desire to know what happens under other people's roofs and his literal "flight" of fancy represent a desire to escape the suffocating reality of 1946 Japan.
*   **The "Ero-Guro" Aesthetic:** The combination of psychological illness, nighttime wandering through red-light districts, and the subtle sexualization (dancers, mistresses) caters to the "erotic-grotesque-nonsense" movement that resurfaced after wartime censorship ended.
