## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

かつたのだろう。お澄はそう思い、終日憂愁に閉ざされていた。
その彼女を、慰めてやろうといった態度で、以前のような甘い言動を示し出したのは、荒田だつた。
「お澄ちゃん、山川が居らんようになつて、面白くねえだろう」
荒田は、ニヤニヤ笑いながら、そんな皮肉を云つた。ライバルを征服した、誇りに満ちた微笑だつた。
お澄が、何も答えず黙つていると
「行先を教えてやろうか……山川は、この俺にだけ行先を知らせて、他所へ行つたんだぜ」
お澄は、涼しい瞳を円くして、知りたい表情をする。
「ふふ、言つて聞かせてやつてもええが、俺だつて、そう無償じゃ喋れねえや……ね、そうだろう？」
荒田は口をいがめて、好色的笑いを洩らすのだつた。言葉の裏面の意味は山川の居所を知らせてやるから、その報酬にお澄の肉体を提供させようということなのだ。
お澄は、荒田の言を本気にして、山川の行先を知りたく思つたが、言葉の裏の意味を知つて断念した。
ところが荒田は、その戦法の不成功に見限りをつけてか、――此度は、あの夜の時のように強引な態度に出て来た。
まこと、なだめたりすかしたりであつた。
その日も、休憩小屋でお澄がモンペを繕つて居ると、荒田がぬつと入つて来て、強引な仕草に出て来た。お澄はようやくの事で小屋の外に飛び出し、危く難を免がれた。
――お澄は宿へ帰る路々、その事と恋人の山川との事で頭が一杯だつた。
俯向いたままどぼとぼと歩いて行くのだ。
つた。――草履を履いた指先に、ことりと触れた物がある。おや？ お澄はもの思いに気を取られていた意識を、足下に注いだ。
お澄は足下の物を拾い上げた。七首の鞘であつた。それには血らしいものが指紋様についていた。彼女は鞘を握つた儘、ふと周囲を見廻した。そして何となく水溜めが気に懸つた。
お澄は水溜めに駆けて行つた。いつかの大雨で、水はいつぱいに満ちていた。水面を凝つと眺め廻し、――あツと危うく声を呑んだ。
岸際に、見覚えのある小指大の木製の、お守り瓢箪が浮いていたのだ。山川の、いつも腰にぶら下げていたものだ。
お澄は、怖い想像を脳裏に描いた。描きながら、愛する山川は殺されたのだ。と思つた。
お澄は生きた心地を失い、まるで、夢遊病者のようにふらふらと倒れた。

　　大　團　圓

勝負に負けた荒田は、凝つと坐つて居れない衝動を覚えて、やにわに土間に飛び下りた。
どこへという当ては無い。彼の魂はもの怪に憑かれたように宙に浮いていた。
どこをどう彷徨したのかも意識せず正気に返つた時には、彼が一度も来た事の無い熊笹の中に立つていた。
ぞつとする、体の内外から言い得ぬ不気味に彼は絶えず襲われていた。
腕と度胸で喧嘩場を渡つて来た荒田でも、しんしんと肌身に喰い入る恐怖には抗しきれなかつた。
「助けてくれッ！」
眼前が真暗になつた感じで、彼は救いを求めた。
「助けてくれッ！」
「助けてくれッ！」
居たまらなくなつて、荒田は絶叫しながら、狂気のようになって、熊笹を分け／＼駆け廻つた。手足を擦りむかれ、血が幾筋か流れていた。
「死ぬ死ぬー！」と喚いた。
その時、頭上近く火玉が長い尾を引いて舞つた。哀れに、恨めしげに舞うのだ。
荒田は、この時までしつかり握つていた短刀を、火玉めがけてハツシと投げつけた。
火玉は二つに割れて、二つが寄り添うて彼方にゆつくり消えて行つた。
荒田は、気を失つてその場に倒れてしまつた。
それから三日目の夕方、荒田は、懸命に山狩りを行つていた土方達に発見された。
荒田は茨の傷だらけになつて冷たくなつていた。
　　×　　×　　×
お澄はあの日から、宿にも、工事場にも姿を見せなかつた。
宿の肺病の娘は、耳の遠い老婆に、盛んに天井を指しながら何かを知らせる風だつたが、唖であるので、老婆には全然何もわからなかつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

It must have been so. Otsumi, thinking thus, was closed in gloom all day long.
To that her, with an attitude as if to comfort, showing sweet words and actions like before, was Arada.
"Otsumi-chan, since Yamakawa has become not here, it is not interesting, is it?"
Arada, while grinning, said such irony. It was a smile full of pride, having conquered a rival.
When Otsumi, answering nothing, remained silent,
"Shall I tell you the destination? ... Yamakawa, only to me informed the destination, and went elsewhere."
Otsumi, making her cool eyes round, makes an expression of wanting to know.
"Heh heh, even if I told it to you it would be fine, but even me, for free cannot speak... hey, is it not so?"
Arada twisted his mouth, and leaked a lecherous laugh. The meaning of the back side of the words was, because I will tell Yamakawa's location, as a reward, have Otsumi provide her body, that is the thing.
Otsumi, taking Arada's words seriously, wanted to know Yamakawa's destination, but knowing the meaning of the back side of the words, abandoned it.
However Arada, perhaps having given up on the failure of that strategy—this time, like at the time of that night, came out with a forceful attitude.
Truly, it was coaxing and intimidating.
That day too, in the rest hut when Otsumi was mending *monpe*, Arada abruptly entered, and came out with forceful gestures. Otsumi, with barely enough effort, flew out of the hut, and narrowly escaped trouble.
—Otsumi, on the roads returning to the inn, with that matter and the matter of her lover Yamakawa, her head was full.
While looking down, she walked ploddingly.
...To the tips of her toes wearing sandals, something touched with a 'kotori' sound. Oh? Otsumi, her consciousness which had been taken by musings, poured toward her feet.
Otsumi picked up the object at her feet. It was a sheath of a dagger. On it, something like blood was attached like fingerprints. She, while clutching the sheath, suddenly looked around. And somehow, the water reservoir weighed on her mind.
Otsumi ran to the water reservoir. Due to the heavy rain of sometime, water was filled to the brim. Staring intently all around the water surface—'Ah!' she narrowly swallowed a cry.
At the edge, a familiar small-finger-sized wooden amulet gourd was floating. It was the thing Yamakawa always had hanging from his waist.
Otsumi drew a scary imagination in her mind. While drawing it, she thought, "Beloved Yamakawa was killed."
Otsumi lost the feeling of being alive, and like a sleepwalker, fell down dizzily.

    Grand Finale

Arada, who lost the battle, feeling an impulse to not be able to sit still, suddenly jumped down to the earthen floor.
There was no destination. His soul, as if possessed by a malevolent spirit, was floating in the air.
Without even being conscious of where or how he wandered, when he returned to his senses, he was standing inside *kumazasa* (bamboo grass) where he had never once come.
A chill, from the inside and outside of his body, an unspeakable eeriness was constantly attacking him.
Even for Arada, who had crossed through fighting grounds with arm-strength and courage, against the fear that bit deeply into his flesh, he could not resist.
"Help me!"
With a feeling as if the front of his eyes became pitch black, he sought help.
"Help me!"
"Help me!"
Unable to bear staying there, Arada, while screaming, becoming like a madman, ran around pushing through the bamboo grass. His limbs were scraped, and several streaks of blood were flowing.
"I'll die, I'll die—!" he wailed.
At that time, near his head, a fireball danced trailing a long tail. Pitifully, it danced as if resentful.
Arada, the dagger he had been clutching tightly until this time, toward the fireball, 'hasshi' he threw.
The fireball split into two, and the two nestled together and slowly went away into the distance and disappeared.
Arada lost consciousness and fell down on that spot.
From then, on the evening of the third day, Arada, by the laborers who were conducting a desperate mountain hunt, was found.
Arada, having become full of wounds from thorns, had become cold.
    X X X
Otsumi, from that day, at the inn, and at the construction site, did not show her figure.
The consumptive daughter of the inn, to the hard-of-hearing old woman, while busily pointing at the ceiling, seemed to be informing something, but because she was a mute, to the old woman, nothing at all was understood.
                  || End ||

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

It must have been the truth. Lost in thought, Otsumi spent the entire day shrouded in a dark melancholy.
It was Arada who approached her then, feigning a desire to comfort her, yet slipping back into the same sickeningly sweet behavior he had shown before.
"Otsumi-chan, it’s not much fun now that Yamakawa is gone, is it?"
Arada let out a sneering laugh as he uttered those ironic words. It was the smile of a man brimming with pride at having finally conquered a rival.
When Otsumi remained silent, offering no reply, he continued:
"Want me to tell you where he went? Yamakawa only told *me* his destination before he cleared out of here."
Otsumi’s cool eyes widened; her face betrayed her desperate need to know.
"Heh, I could tell you, I suppose. But I can't exactly talk for free... right? You understand, don't you?"
Arada’s mouth twisted into a lecherous grin. The subtext was clear: if she wanted to know Yamakawa's whereabouts, the price would be her own body.
Otsumi briefly took Arada’s words at face value, yearning for news of Yamakawa, but the moment she grasped his hidden meaning, she abandoned the thought.
Seeing that this psychological tactic had failed, Arada changed his approach. This time, he became aggressive, just as he had been that other night.
He tried everything—coaxing, then threatening.
Later that day, while Otsumi was mending her *monpe* trousers in the rest hut, Arada suddenly loomed in the doorway and made a violent move toward her. Otsumi barely managed to scramble out of the hut, narrowly escaping his grasp.
On her way back to the inn, Otsumi's mind was a whirlwind of anxiety over Arada's assault and her missing lover, Yamakawa.
She walked with her head down, her steps heavy and plodding.
...Suddenly, the tip of her straw sandal struck something with a soft *clack*. "Oh?" Startled out of her reverie, she focused her attention on the ground.
Otsumi picked up the object. It was the sheath of a dagger. It was smeared with what looked like bloody fingerprints. Still clutching the sheath, she glanced around nervously. Her eyes were drawn, for no particular reason, toward a nearby water reservoir.
She ran to the edge. The reservoir was swollen to the brim from a recent heavy rain. She scanned the surface of the water—and then, with a gasp, she nearly choked on her own breath.
There, floating near the bank, was a small wooden amulet shaped like a gourd, no bigger than a pinky finger. It was the very charm Yamakawa always wore hanging from his waist.
A horrific realization flashed through her mind. In that moment, she knew: her beloved Yamakawa had been murdered.
The strength drained from her body; like a sleepwalker, she collapsed dizzily to the ground.

    The Grand Finale

Defeated in his pursuit, Arada felt an unbearable impulse; he couldn't sit still for another second. He leapt down into the earthen-floored entryway.
He had no destination. His soul seemed to drift in the air, as if possessed by some vengeful spirit.
He wandered aimlessly, unaware of his surroundings. By the time he regained his senses, he was standing in a thicket of bamboo grass—a place he had never visited before.
A shudder ran through him. He was besieged by an inexplicable, bone-chilling dread from both within and without.
Though Arada was a man who had survived many a brawl with nothing but his fists and his nerve, he found himself powerless against this cold, creeping terror.
"Help me!"
His vision seemed to go pitch black. He cried out for salvation.
"Help me! Someone, help me!"
Unable to endure the silence, Arada began to scream. Like a madman, he thrashed through the sharp bamboo grass. His arms and legs were torn open, and blood began to trickle from the wounds.
"I'm going to die! I'm dying!" he wailed.
Just then, a fireball appeared near his head, dancing through the air with a long, trailing tail. It flitted about with a piteous, resentful grace.
Arada, still clutching the dagger he had held throughout his flight, hurled it with all his might at the light.
The fireball split in two. The two smaller lights nestled against each other and slowly drifted away into the distance until they vanished.
Arada lost consciousness and collapsed on the spot.
Three days later, in the evening, he was found by a group of laborers who had been conducting a desperate search of the mountains.
Arada was covered in scratches from thorns, his body long since grown cold.
    * * *
From 그날 on, Otsumi was never seen again—not at the inn, nor at the construction site.
The innkeeper’s daughter, who suffered from consumption, frequently pointed toward the ceiling as if trying to tell the hard-of-hearing old woman something important. But because the girl was mute, the old woman understood nothing at all.
                  || The End ||

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** This is a standard page from a Japanese "B6" or "A5" size popular literature book or magazine. It uses vertical text (tategaki), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho style typical of mid-century printing. It uses some historical kana orthography (e.g., 居らん、ニヤニヤ、あツ, 繕つて), which was common until the post-WWII orthography reforms were fully adopted.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** 
    *   The main narrative text occupies the majority of the page.
    *   The section title "大 團 圓" (Grand Finale/Great Conclusion) is centered and set apart by extra spacing, signaling the final act of the story.
    *   The "|| おわり ||" (The End) mark is placed at the very bottom left, standard for a serialized conclusion.
    *   Three "x" marks act as a temporal or scene divider before the epilogue.
*   **Illustration:** The line drawing in the center-right depicts the protagonist, Otsumi, in her *monpe* (work trousers), looking distressed. In the background, a man's face (likely Arada) is shown with a dark, predatory expression. The style is typical of *sashi-e* (inserted illustrations) in popular fiction of the 1940s-50s.
*   **Pagination:** The number (83) at the bottom indicates this is a mid-volume page.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War / Showa 20s):** The mention of *monpe* (functional work trousers worn by women during and shortly after WWII) and *doboku* (civil engineering/construction) sites suggests a setting in the late 1940s or early 1950s. This was a period of reconstruction in Japan where laborers (*土方 - dokata*) moved frequently for work.
*   **Monpe:** These were mandated for women during the war for mobility and safety. Post-war, they remained common in rural and manual labor settings.
*   **Hitodama (Fireball):** The "fireball" (*火玉 / hitodama*) is a classic Japanese supernatural element. It is believed to be the soul of a recently deceased person, often appearing to those they harbor a grudge against or those who killed them. Its appearance here signifies Yamakawa’s vengeful spirit.
*   **Social Class:** The characters are working-class—laborers and inn staff. This type of "pulp" fiction (*taishu bungaku*) often dealt with raw human emotions: lust, revenge, and the supernatural.
*   **Disability and Disease:** The mention of a "consumptive" (tuberculosis) daughter and a "mute" character reflects the commonality of TB in that era and the use of physical ailments as dramatic devices in literature to create a sense of tragic isolation.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **憂愁 (Yūshū):** Melancholy or grief. A literary term setting a heavy tone.
*   **モンペ (Monpe):** Traditional Japanese work trousers, synonymous with the wartime and immediate post-war era.
*   **七首 (Aikuchi / Shisshu):** A dagger without a handguard. Often associated with criminals or desperate characters in this era of fiction.
*   **大團圓 (Daidan'en):** The traditional term for a "Grand Finale" or a happy ending where all threads are tied up (though here the "ending" is quite tragic).
*   **土方 (Dokata):** A somewhat derogatory or rough term for construction laborers.
*   **熊笹 (Kumazasa):** A type of low-growing bamboo grass common in Japanese mountains, often used in literature to symbolize a disorienting, wild environment.
*   **唖 (Oshi):** An archaic and now-offensive term for a person who cannot speak (mute).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Karmic Retribution (Kaden):** The villain Arada, having presumably killed his rival Yamakawa, is driven mad by guilt and supernatural intervention. He dies "cold" (dead) in the mountains, a direct result of his crimes.
*   **The Supernatural vs. The Real:** The story blends gritty realism (harassment, labor camps, murder) with the supernatural (the *hitodama*). The fireball isn't just a ghost; it's the physical manifestation of Arada's psychological breakdown.
*   **The Tragic Heroine:** Otsumi is a classic tragic figure of the era—hardworking, harassed by a predator, and ultimately losing her love and her place in society (disappearing at the end).
*   **Uncommunicated Truth:** The ending is particularly dark. The only witness to the "truth" (the daughter) cannot speak, and the one person who might listen is deaf. This reinforces a theme of cosmic indifference or the impossibility of justice in a broken world.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Novel, Period Drama (*Jidai-geki* style set in contemporary times).
*   **Genre:** Tragedy, Supernatural, Rural Noir.
*   **Themes:** Murder, Revenge, Ghost Story, Post-war struggle, Sexual Harassment, Karma.
*   **Tone:** Melancholy, Suspenseful, Morbid.
