流行作家の実相を暴く
芸術を腐蝕するもの
覆面作家

（一）
盛一は、小さい頃から、小説を讀む事が大好だつた。隙さえあれば本を讀んだし、暇がなくなつても、親に隠れて勉強をサボつてまで、文学書を漁つた。
夏目漱石、芥川龍之介、菊池寛、吉川英治、吉屋信子……何だつて構わない、手当り次第、程度の高いものでも低いものでも、大衆書だろうが文学書だろうが、小説であり、文学でありさえすればよかつた。昨日高山樗牛の瀧口入道を読んでいたかと思うと、今日は佐藤紅緑の少年小説を読み、明日（あした）はトルストイの訳文が見たい、といった風だつた。

その彼が、ふとした事から、一躍無冠の帝王として、文壇に躍り出したとしても、何の不思議でもない訳だが、偶然というか幸運というのか、彼が成功と名遂げたのは、あまりにも早過ぎ、しかも、彼には夢想もしなかつた恐ろしい世界に、自らを葬つてしまおうとは、思えば奇しき輪廻とも云えよう。
文壇に、芸能界に、人気と名声の脚光を浴びて、華やかな人生を、面白おかしく暮しているかの如くに見える、所謂大文豪達が、自らの意志の抗争に敗れて、遂には堕ちてゆく無間地獄のある事を、果してどれだけの人が、知つている事だろうか？

盛一も、その一人だつたのである。彼が、本を讀むだけでは飽き足らず、これ位の事なら、僕だつて書ける。そう思つて、仕事の余暇に原稿用紙を取上げ、読切百枚の「金環蝕」なる一篇を書下して、東京の文芸読物社へ送つてみたのは、彼が二十六、昭和二十三年の秋の事だつた。
一ヶ月たつても、二ヶ月たつても、何の便りもないままに、やはり駄目だつたのか、と思つていた所へ、その年の冬に、
「貴作発表致したく、就きましては、あのままではダメだが、編輯部で改作を施せば、必ずや大傑作になる事、請合いと思う。そしてそれを発表する事には、勿論貴方の名前により、世界的大雑誌、『文芸読物』に、諸大家と堂々と名を連ねて、掲載の栄を担われるのである。若し御承諾願えるなら、些少ながら、稿料として金弐千円也進呈します。」

といったような事が、まるで女郎の手紙みたいに、長々と書いてあつた。それでも、処女作なんてものは、活字になる事だけで、感涙にむせぶものなのだから、彼は二つ返事で応諾する事にした。何しろ世界的大雑誌に、諸大家と名を連ねるんだから、正直な所、内心は大満悦だつたのだ。
それに、金弐千円也という金を、始めて雑誌社から頂戴した事も、文学を志すものの夢として、又有難い極みだつた。この二千円也というのは、その社の原稿募集の広告に、採用の分には一枚二百円以上の稿料を呈す。という一文があつたのだが、この何円以上という奴は、僕の経験によると、それ以上は絶対に払いませんという、断り文句みたいなものらしい。だから百枚で二万円、二千円だから、規定の十分の一に叩かれた訳である。
そしてその翌年の三月に、贈呈のハンコを捺した怪しげな雑誌が、彼の手許へ送られて来た。まア超学術雑誌に近い奴で、これが世界的大雑誌だなんて、三文文士諸兄よ、以て冥すべきであろう。成程一流諸大家の名前も見えたが、一場面傑作集で、挿画の側に

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Exposing the actual state of popular writers.
Things that corrode art.
Masked Writer.

(1)
Seiichi, from the time he was small, liked reading novels very much. If there was even a gap [of time], he read books, and even if he ran out of free time, he would hide from his parents and even skip studying to fish for literary books. Natsume Soseki, Akutagawa Ryunosuke, Kikuchi Kan, Yoshikawa Eiji, Yoshiya Nobuko... anything did not matter, whatever came to hand, high-degree things or low-degree things, whether popular books or literary books, as long as it was a novel, as long as it was literature, it was fine. Thinking he was reading Takayama Chogyu's *Takiguchi Nyudo* yesterday, today he reads Sato Koroku's boys' novels, and tomorrow he wants to see Tolstoy's translations, it was that kind of style.

That him, from a chance thing, even if he leaped out into the literary world as a suddenly uncrowned emperor, it is no wonder, but whether to call it accident or luck, his achieving success and a name was too fast, and moreover, to bury himself in a terrifying world he never even dreamed of, if one thinks about it, it could be called a strange reincarnation. In the literary world, in the entertainment world, appearing to live a colorful life interestingly while bathing in the spotlight of popularity and fame, the so-called great master writers, having lost the struggle of their own will, finally falling into a bottomless hell (Avici)—how many people, I wonder, really know of its existence?

Seiichi was also one of them. He, not being satisfied with only reading books, thinking "If it's this level of thing, even I can write," took up manuscript paper in the leisure time of his work, wrote a one-shot piece of one hundred pages called *Kinkanshoku* (Annular Eclipse), and sent it to the Bungei Yomimono Company in Tokyo; that was in the autumn of Showa 23, when he was twenty-six. Even after one month passed, even after two months passed, with no news at all, just as he was thinking "As expected, was it no good?", in the winter of that year:
"Wishing to publish your work, regarding that, as it is now it is no good, but if the editorial department applies revisions, I think it is guaranteed to become a great masterpiece. And in publishing that, of course by your name, in the world-class magazine *Bungei Yomimono*, you will grandly line up your name with various great masters and bear the honor of publication. If we can obtain your consent, although a small amount, we will present two thousand yen as a manuscript fee."

Things such as that were written at great length, just like a prostitute's letter. Even so, since a debut work is something one chokes with tears of gratitude just for it becoming printed type, he decided to give consent with a "two-word reply" (readily). After all, since he would line up his name with various masters in a world-class magazine, honestly, inside he was extremely satisfied. Moreover, receiving the money of two thousand yen for the first time from a magazine company was also, as a dream of one aspiring to literature, the height of gratitude. Regarding this two thousand yen, in that company's advertisement for manuscript recruitment, there was a sentence saying "For accepted pieces, we offer a manuscript fee of 200 yen or more per page," but this "or more" guy, according to my experience, seems to be a kind of disclaimer meaning "we will absolutely not pay more than that." Therefore, while 100 pages should be 20,000 yen, it was 2,000 yen, so it was beaten down to one-tenth of the regulation.
And in March of the following year, a suspicious magazine with a "complimentary" stamp pressed on it was sent to his hand. Well, it was a guy close to a "super-academic" [low-quality/niche] magazine, and for this to be a world-class magazine—O fellow hack writers, you should be able to die in peace with this. Indeed, the names of first-rate great masters were visible, but it was a "one-scene masterpiece collection," and beside the illustrations...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Exposing the Reality of Popular Authors: The Corrupters of Art**
By the Masked Writer

(1)
Ever since he was a child, Seiichi had been obsessed with reading. He devoured books at every opportunity; even when he had no time to spare, he would hide from his parents and skip his studies just to scavenge for literature. Soseki, Akutagawa, Kikuchi Kan, Yoshikawa Eiji, Yoshiya Nobuko—it didn't matter who the author was. He didn't care if a book was high-brow or low-brow, a mass-market thriller or "serious" literature, as long as it was a story. One day he’d be immersed in Takayama Chogyu’s *Takiguchi Nyudo*; the next, he’d be reading Sato Koroku’s adventure stories for boys; the day after that, he’d be hunting for a translation of Tolstoy.

Given his passion, it might not have been surprising if he had suddenly leaped onto the literary stage as an "uncrowned king." Yet, whether by fluke or by fate, his rise to fame happened far too quickly. Looking back, one might call it a strange cycle of karma that he ended up burying himself in a terrifying world he had never even imagined. To the public, the so-called "Great Masters" of literature and entertainment appear to live glamorous lives, basking in the spotlight of fame and popularity. But how many people truly know of the "Avici Hell" that awaits those who lose the battle of their own will and eventually fall into ruin?

Seiichi was one such man. No longer satisfied with merely reading, he thought to himself, "I could write something at this level." During his time off from work, he took up his pen and wrote a hundred-page story titled *Annular Eclipse*. It was the autumn of 1948; he was twenty-six years old. He sent the manuscript to a publisher in Tokyo called *Bungei Yomimono*. One month passed, then two, with no word. Just as he was beginning to think he’d failed, a letter arrived that winter.

"We wish to publish your work," it began. "However, it will not do in its current form. If our editorial team revises it, we guarantee it will become a masterpiece. By publishing it, your name will appear in the world-class magazine *Bungei Yomimono*, standing proudly alongside the great masters of our time. If you consent, we will offer the modest sum of 2,000 yen as a manuscript fee."

The letter was long-winded and manipulative, reminiscent of the flowery, deceptive notes written by high-ranking courtesans to ensnare their clients. Nevertheless, for a writer’s debut, the mere prospect of seeing one’s words in print is enough to bring tears of joy. Seiichi accepted immediately. He was, quite frankly, overjoyed at the thought of his name appearing next to literary giants in a world-renowned publication. Receiving 2,000 yen—his first payment from a publisher—was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. The magazine’s recruitment ad had promised "200 yen or more per page." As it turns out, in the publishing world, "or more" is a euphemism for "we will never pay a cent more than the minimum." For a hundred-page manuscript, he should have received 20,000 yen. Instead, he was paid exactly one-tenth of the advertised rate.

In March of the following year, a suspicious-looking magazine arrived, stamped "Complimentary Copy." It was a wretched rag—hardly the "world-class magazine" he had been promised. My fellow hack writers, if this is what passes for a "global publication," then we might as well die happy now! Sure enough, the names of famous authors were there, but only in a "Greatest Hits" collection of single scenes, printed as mere captions for the illustrations...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography and Titles:** The layout is characterized by dramatic, hand-brushed titles on the right side. The main headline, "流行作家の実相を暴く" (Exposing the Reality of Popular Writers), is written in a bold, calligraphic style intended to grab the reader's attention with a sense of scandal and urgency.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "芸術を腐蝕するもの" (Things that Corrupt Art) is slightly smaller but equally bold, positioned as a thematic subtitle. The attribution "覆面作家" (Masked Writer) adds an air of mystery and insider gossip, a common trope in "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines of the era.
*   **Column Structure:** The text follows the traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). The page is divided into columns of roughly equal width. The use of "(一)" indicates this is the first part of a serialized essay or story.
*   **Ruby Text (Furigana):** Small kana are used sparingly over certain kanji (e.g., 明日/あした, 金環蝕/きんかんしょく) to aid readability or specify a particular reading, typical of general-interest publications.
*   **Formatting Elements:** The letter from the publisher is set apart with corner brackets (「...」), creating a distinct "voice" within the narrative. The page number "(52)" is centered at the bottom.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-War 1940s):** The text explicitly mentions "Showa 23" (1948). This was a period of extreme hardship, inflation, and social upheaval in Japan following WWII. The literary world was booming as censorship eased, but it was also a "wild west" of fly-by-night publishers and pulp magazines known as *Kasutori-zasshi*.
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** The cynical tone and "masked writer" persona strongly suggest this is from a *Kasutori* magazine. These were cheap, low-quality publications that focused on sex, scandal, and the "dark side" of society, typically lasting only three issues (like the "three shots" of *kasutori* shochu).
*   **Monetary Value:** 2,000 yen in 1948 was a significant amount of money for a young man (the starting salary for a teacher was around 3,000-4,000 yen), but as the text notes, it was a fraction of the promised "professional" rate. The deception regarding the "200 yen per page" highlights the predatory nature of the pulp industry.
*   **Literary References:** The mentions of Soseki, Akutagawa, and Tolstoy contrast sharply with the reality of the "trashy" magazine Seiichi ends up in. This highlights the gap between literary aspiration and the commercial reality of the post-war publishing boom.
*   **Avici Hell (無間地獄):** A Buddhist term for the lowest and most painful level of hell. Its use here reflects the dramatic, almost melodramatic, rhetorical style of the era's exposé writing.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **無冠の帝王 (Mukan no Teio):** "Uncrowned King." Refers to someone with great power or talent who lacks an official title. Often used for influential journalists or writers.
*   **文壇 (Bundan):** The literary world or the literary establishment in Japan.
*   **女郎の手紙 (Joro no tegami):** "A prostitute's letter." Traditionally, these were stereotyped as being overly long, flowery, and full of false promises or flattery intended to trick a customer into coming back.
*   **二つ返事 (Futatsu henji):** Literally "two-reply." It means to agree immediately and enthusiastically without hesitation.
*   **三文文士 (Sanmon bunshi):** "Three-penny writer" or hack writer. A self-deprecating or derogatory term for writers who produce low-quality work for little pay.
*   **以て冥すべき (Motte meisubeki):** A variation of "motte meisubeki de aru," meaning one can die in peace or be satisfied with one's lot. Here used sarcastically.
*   **金環蝕 (Kinkanshoku):** Annular solar eclipse. A metaphor often used in Japanese literature to describe something beautiful but inherently shadowed or corrupt (later made famous by the novel by Ishikawa Tatsuzo).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Disillusionment:** The primary theme is the gap between the idealistic "dream" of becoming a writer and the "terrifying world" of the actual publishing industry.
*   **Corruption of Art:** As the title suggests, the text argues that the commercialization of literature and the predatory practices of publishers "corrode" the value of art.
*   **The "Insider" Perspective:** By using a "Masked Writer" persona, the author creates a subtext of "telling the truth that the elite literary world wants to hide." It appeals to the reader's desire for scandal and "behind-the-scenes" access.
*   **Exploitation:** The detailed breakdown of the manuscript fee illustrates the exploitation of aspiring writers by publishers who use deceptive advertising.
*   **Irony and Cynicism:** The ending is deeply ironic. The protagonist thinks he is joining the ranks of "world-class" masters, only to find his work reduced to mere filler for a low-grade rag.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay/Fiction (Semi-autobiographical "Confessional" style)
*   **Genre:** Pulp fiction, Literary exposé, *Kasutori* literature
*   **Tags:** Post-war Japan, publishing industry, satire, disillusionment, corruption, literary world, 1940s, Showa era.
