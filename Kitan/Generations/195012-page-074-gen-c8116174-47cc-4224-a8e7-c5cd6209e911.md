**人間の子を生んだ猿の話**
**夏原常雄**

（３）
がふらついて仕方がないのです、私は草臥れてとある辻堂に腰を下して休んでしまいました。
するとその時です。突然眼の前の草むらがガサ／＼と動いたと思ふとヌツと顔を出したのは紛れもないあの牝猿でした。私はその時に全く膽を冷しました。しかし牝猿はさもなつかし氣に、じつと私の顔を見つめてゐるのです。元より危害を加へるやうな氣色もありません。私は始めて安心しておいでゝゝをしました。牝猿はうれしそうに近づいて来ました。そしてしきりにその毛深い体を私の体にすりつけて、どうしていいのか分らないといった風でした。私もしきりにこの牝猿が可愛くなつて頭をなでていいました。
と突然、私の頭には一閃ある妙な考へが浮び上りました。そしてその次の瞬間、私は鳥肌を立てゝこれを打消すことに努力しましたがそれは空しいことでした。私の頬は紅潮しました。これでいて額には冷い汗がたら／＼とつたいました。
それは全く私自身も想像せぬ事でした。
身体がぶる／＼ふるえ、手足ががた／＼鳴りました。その事を再び考へまいとあせればあせる程私はその妄想の恐ろしさに襲はれました。
さうしてたつたさつきのあの男が言つた言葉を思い出していたのです。
辻堂の中のあんな優しい顔をしていた地蔵様の姿さえその時ばかりはまともに見ることが出来ませんでした。

（４）
それから二ヶ月たちました。すつかり元通りになつた私は、相變らず鐵砲をかついで野山をかけまわつていました。そして或日のこと、またあの牝猿に遭いました。私はその時の礼をいうのを期待した彼は、牝猿が其後身重になったことをあかしてくれました。
私は一瞬再びあの恐怖の淵にたゝきこまれてしまいました。だがそれと同時にあの牝猿の姿が大きくうかんで私はじつとしていられない氣持でした。あの牝猿の胎に私の子供がいる！ それは何という恐ろしいことでしょう。今にも足元の草むらがガサ／＼と動いて、大きな腹をかゝえた牝猿がぬつと出てきそうな氣がして仕方ありませんでした。
私はとう／＼いたたまらなくなつて、呆氣にとられている男をそこに残して一目散に我が家へかけ戻つて、蒲團を頭からすつぽりかむつてガタ／＼ふるえていました。そしてその晩から烈しい熱を出して三日三晩うなされつづけました。
それから一年たちました頃、私は又同じ仲間に黒熊山行をさそわれました。私は全く行く氣がしませんでしたが、余り皆がすゝめるのでとう／＼出かけることになりました。
道中あの山の男の小屋を訪ねましたが、そこには後影もなく壊れ男はどこへ引越したかわかりませんでした。私はもしやあの牝猿に出遭いたいかと、内心ビク／＼したのですが、幸いそんなことで、大いに安心しそれから倫も奥へ奥へと急ぎました。

（５）
と、ある尾根を曲つた時、突然一人が足をとめました。そして叫ぶのです。
「おい、皆の衆獲物だぞ。」
「何だ？どこだどこだ。」
「そらあの樹の洞にさ。猿がいるだろう。」
「うん。いる／＼親子だな」
皆な口々にわめきました。見ると成程、一丁も距つた高い樫の木の洞に親子づれの猿が腰かけていました。しかし私は一瞬ギクリとしました。それは紛れもないあの牝猿なのです。そして仔猿はよくみるとそれは猿の子とは思えないような妙なものでした。むしろ人間の嬰兒そのものでした。私はそこですべてを了解しました。
そしてふとみると、仲間の者たちはもう鉄砲を構えているのです。かの猿はねらわれているともしらず、ぼんやりと日向ぼっこをしている風でした。私はあわてゝ皆にいいました。
「皆の衆。頼むからあの猿は俺にうたせてくれ。」
「ほほう。それは又どうしてだ」
「何うでもいい。とにかく俺にやらせてくれ。」
皆がいいとも悪いともいわないうちに、私は急いで肩から鉄砲をはずすやいなやドーンと一發ぶつ放しました。
ねらい違わず子猿はぐる／＼と廻つて樹の下へ墜落しました。せめてもの贖罪とはいえ、私が見（？）を他人（ひと）の手で殺す氣にはなれなかつかったのです。銃聲に驚いた親猿がギヤーと鋭い声を上げて、らんらんたる眼でこちらをにらんだ時、私は思わず目をつむりました。然しその次の瞬間、他の銃彈はものゝ見事にこの牝猿の心臓を貫きました。
私はすぐ飛出して、可愛いゝ子猿を上衣にくるむと、そのまま皆の處とは反對の方角へだんだん走りました。皆がワイ／＼騒ぐ聲を背にきゝ乍ら、
そしてあの男の小屋跡の土をほりかえして子猿の死骸をそつと埋めて、急いで土をかぶせました。
私が一人とぼ／＼と村へ歸つたのは翌朝でした。
いろ／＼訊ねる人たちに答えようとはせず私はその日限り、猟具一切を他人に譲つてしまいました。
そして今日までこうして百姓ばかりやつて参りました。
私は女房を貰う事もせず、事實上の禁慾生活を送つてゐます。そして時折はこつそりと黒熊山のあの小屋跡へ行つてみるのですが誰一人知る筈もないこの墓へいつの間にか最新しい無記名の墓標を發見した時、私は愕然として色を失つてしまいましたが、三十年後のその墓標も全く腐つてしまつた今日まで、それを誰が立てたのかを不思議な謎として考へつづけてゐる次第です。

頭がふらついて仕方がないのです。私はくたびれて、とある辻堂に腰を下ろして休んでしまいました。
するとその時です。突然目の前の草むらがガサガサと動いたと思うと、ヌッと顔を出したのは、紛れもないあの牝猿（めざる）でした。私はその時に全く肝を冷やしました。しかし牝猿はさも懐かしげに、じっと私の顔を見つめているのです。もとより危害を加えるような気配もありません。私は初めて安心しておいで、おいでをしました。牝猿は嬉しそうに近づいて来ました。そしてしきりにその毛深い体を私の体にすりつけて、どうしていいのか分からないといった風でした。私も次第にこの牝猿が可愛くなって、頭を撫でてやりました。
と突然、私の頭には一閃、ある妙な考えが浮かび上がりました。そしてその次の瞬間、私は鳥肌を立ててこれを打ち消すことに努力しましたが、それは空しいことでした。私の頬は紅潮しました。それでいて額には冷たい汗がタラタラと伝わりました。
それは全く私自身も想像せぬ事でした。
身体がブルブル震え、手足がガタガタ鳴りました。その事を再び考えまいと焦れば焦るほど、私はその妄想の恐ろしさに襲われました。
そうして、たったさっきのあの男が言った言葉を思い出していたのです。
辻堂の中のあんな優しい顔をしていた地蔵様の姿さえ、その時ばかりはまともに見ることが出来ませんでした。

（４）
それから二ヶ月たちました。すっかり元通りになった私は、相変わらず鉄砲を担いで野山を駆け回っていました。そしてある日のこと、またあの（山の）男に会いました。私はその時の礼を言うのを期待したのですが、彼は牝猿がその後身重（みおも）になったことを明かしてくれました。
私は一瞬、再びあの恐怖の淵に叩き込まれてしまいました。だがそれと同時に、あの牝猿の姿が大きく浮かんで、私はじっとしていられない気持ちでした。あの牝猿の胎内に私の子供がいる！ それは何という恐ろしいことでしょう。今にも足元の草むらがガサガサと動いて、大きな腹を抱えた牝猿がヌッと出てきそうな気がして仕方ありませんでした。
私はとうとう居たたまれなくなって、呆気にとられている男をそこに残して、一目散に我が家へ駆け戻り、布団を頭からすっぽり被ってガタガタ震えていました。そしてその晩から激しい熱を出して、三日三晩うなされ続けました。
それから一年経ちました頃、私はまた同じ仲間に黒熊山（くろくまやま）行を誘われました。私は全く行く気がしませんでしたが、あまり皆が勧めるので、とうとう出かけることになりました。

「おい、皆の衆、獲物だぞ」
「何だ？ どこだどこだ」
「そら、あの樹の洞（うろ）にさ。猿がいるだろう」
「うん。いる、いる。親子だな」
皆が口々に喚（わめ）きました。見ると、なるほど、一丁（約109メートル）も隔たった高い樫（かし）の木の洞に、親子連れの猿が腰掛けていました。しかし、私は一瞬ギクリとしました。それは紛れもないあの牝猿なのです。そして仔猿（こざる）をよく見ると、それは猿の子とは思えないような妙なものでした。むしろ人間の赤ん坊そのものでした。私はそこですべてを了解しました。
そしてふと見ると、仲間の者たちはもう鉄砲を構えているのです。かの猿は狙われているとも知らず、ぼんやりと日向（ひなた）ぼっこをしている風でした。私は慌てて皆に言いました。
「皆の衆、頼むからあの猿は俺に撃たせてくれ」
「ほほう、それはまたどうしてだ」
「何でもいい。とにかく俺にやらせてくれ」
皆が良いとも悪いとも言わないうちに、私は急いで肩から鉄砲を外すやいなや、ドーンと一発ぶっ放しました。
狙い違わず、子猿はグルグルと回って樹の下へ墜落しました。せめてもの贖罪とはいえ、我が子を他人の手で殺す気にはなれなかったのです。銃声に驚いた親猿が「ギヤー」と鋭い声を上げて、爛々（らんらん）たる眼でこちらを睨んだ時、私は思わず目をつむりました。しかしその次の瞬間、仲間の銃弾は見事にこの牝猿の心臓を貫きました。
私はすぐ飛び出して、可愛い子猿を上着に包むと、そのまま皆の所とは反対の方角へ走りました。皆がワイワイ騒ぐ声を背に聞きながら。
そして、あの男の小屋跡の土を掘り返して、子猿の死骸をそっと埋めて、急いで土を被せました。

Dizzy and it could not be helped, I, being exhausted, at a certain roadside shrine sat down and rested.
Then it was that time. Suddenly thinking the grass in front of my eyes moved "gasa-gasa," the one that popped out its face was none other than that female monkey. I at that time completely chilled my gall (was terrified). However, the female monkey, looking very nostalgic, was staring intently at my face. From the start, there was no sign of adding harm. I for the first time feeling relieved did an "come here, come here." The female monkey happily came closer. And repeatedly she rubbed her hairy body against my body, appearing like she didn't know what to do. I too gradually found this female monkey cute and stroked her head and spoke.
Then suddenly, in my head a flash of a certain strange thought floated up. And that next moment, I got goosebumps and tried to effort at denying this, but it was a vain thing. My cheeks flushed. Yet on my forehead cold sweat "tara-tara" flowed.
That was a thing even I myself had not imagined.
My body "buru-buru" trembled, hands and feet "gata-gata" rang. The more I hurried not to think of that thing again, the more I was attacked by the horror of that delusion.
And so, I was remembering the words the man from just a while ago said.
Even the figure of the Jizo-sama who had such a gentle face inside the shrine, only at that time, I could not look at directly.

(4)
Since then two months passed. Having completely returned to my original state, I as usual carrying a gun ran around the fields and mountains. And on a certain day, I met that (mountain) man again. I expected to say thanks for that time, but he revealed to me that the female monkey had after that become heavy with body (pregnant).
I for a flash again into that abyss of terror was knocked. But at the same time, that female monkey's figure largely floated and I was in a feeling of not being able to stay still. In that female monkey's womb my child is! What a terrifying thing that is. Even now the grass at my feet "gasa-gasa" moves, and a female monkey holding a big belly feels like she will "nu-ttu" come out and it cannot be helped.
I finally becoming unable to stay, leaving the man who was taken aback there, in one dash ran back to my house, and covering myself with a futon from the head "gata-gata" was trembling. And from that night I put out a fierce fever and for three days and three nights continued to be delirious.
When about one year passed from then, I again by the same companions was invited to a Black Bear Mountain trek. I did not have the feeling to go at all, but because everyone recommended it so much, finally it was decided I would go out.
On the way I visited that mountain man's hut, but there was no trace of him, it was broken, and where the man moved to was not known. I wondered if I might encounter that female monkey, and was "biku-biku" (nervous) inside, but fortunately such a thing [didn't happen], I greatly felt relieved and from then hurried deeper and deeper into the mountains.

(5)
And, when we turned a certain ridge, suddenly one person stopped his feet. And he shouts.
"Hey, everyone, it's prey."
"What? Where, where?"
"Look, in that tree hole. There's a monkey, right?"
"Yeah. There are, there are. A parent and child."
Everyone in various voices clamored. Looking, indeed, about one cho distant in a high oak tree hole, a parent and child monkey were sitting. But I for a flash went "gikuri" (startled). That is none other than that female monkey. And looking closely at the child monkey, it was a strange thing that did not seem like a monkey's child. Rather it was a human infant itself. I there understood everything.
And when I glanced, the companions were already aiming their guns. That monkey, without knowing she was being aimed at, was in a manner of absentmindedly sunbathing. I in a hurry said to everyone.
"Everyone. I beg of you, let me shoot that monkey."
"Ho-ho. Why is that again?"
"Anything is fine. Anyway let me do it."
While everyone said neither good nor bad, the moment I hurried and took the gun off my shoulder, "Doon!" I let off one shot.
Without missing the aim, the child monkey "guru-guru" spun and fell to the bottom of the tree. Even if it was at least an atonement, I could not be in the spirit of having my child killed by another person's hand. The parent monkey surprised by the gunshot raised a sharp "Gyā!" voice, and when she glared here with glowing eyes, I unintentionally closed my eyes. But that next moment, the other's bullet brilliantly pierced this female monkey's heart.
I immediately jumped out, and wrapping the cute child monkey in my jacket, ran just like that in the opposite direction from everyone's place. While hearing the voices of everyone making a "wai-wai" fuss behind my back.
And, digging up the earth of that man's hut site, I quietly buried the child monkey's corpse, and hurried and covered it with earth.
That I alone "tobo-tobo" (ploddingly) returned to the village was the next morning.
To the people who asked various things I did not try to answer, and from that day on, I gave away all hunting tools to others.
And until today in this way I have been doing only farming.
I without taking a wife, am living a de facto ascetic life. And sometimes I secretly go to that hut site of Black Bear Mountain, but at this grave which no one person should know, when I discovered a brand new unnamed grave marker before I knew it, I was aghast and lost color (turned pale), but until today when that grave marker from thirty years later has completely rotted away, who stood it up, as a mysterious riddle, I am in the state of continuing to think.

Dizziness overcame me to the point of helplessness. Exhausted, I sat down to rest at a small roadside shrine. It was then that it happened. Suddenly, the grass before my eyes rustled, and the face that poked through was unmistakably that of that female monkey. My blood ran cold. Yet, she gazed at me with such a look of longing and nostalgia that I found no sign of malice in her. For the first time, I felt at ease and gestured for her to come closer. She approached joyfully, rubbing her hairy body against mine as if she didn't quite know how to express her affection. I, too, felt a growing fondness for her and stroked her head, murmuring softly.
Suddenly, a bizarre thought flashed through my mind. In the next heartbeat, I felt goosebumps prickle my skin. I tried desperately to push the thought away, but it was futile. My cheeks burned with a flush, even as cold sweat trickled down my forehead. It was something I had never even imagined myself capable of.
My body shook uncontrollably; my limbs felt as though they were rattling. The more I tried to suppress the thought, the more the horror of that delusion consumed me. I found myself remembering the words the mountain man had spoken just moments before. Even the gentle face of the Jizo statue in the shrine was something I could no longer look at directly.

(4)
Two months passed. Having recovered my health, I was back to roaming the mountains with my gun as usual. One day, I encountered that man again. I intended to thank him for his previous help, but he dropped a bombshell: the female monkey was pregnant.
Once more, I was plunged into an abyss of terror. Yet, at the same moment, the image of that monkey loomed large in my mind, and I felt a restless, unbearable agitation. My child was in that monkey’s womb! How horrific! I felt as though at any moment, the grass at my feet would rustle and that pregnant monkey would emerge, her belly swollen with my offspring.
Unable to bear it any longer, I left the bewildered man standing there and bolted for home. I crawled under my quilts and lay there shivering. That night, I succumbed to a violent fever that kept me in a delirious state for three days and three nights.
A year went by. My companions invited me on a hunting trip to Black Bear Mountain. I had no desire to go, but they were so persistent that I eventually relented. On the way, I visited the site of the man’s hut, but it was a ruin; the man had vanished without a trace. I was terrified of running into the monkey, but fortunately, we saw no sign of her, and I pushed deeper into the mountains, feeling somewhat relieved.

(5)
As we rounded a ridge, one of the men stopped short and shouted, “Hey, look! Prey!”
“Where? What is it?”
“There, in the hollow of that tree. See the monkeys?”
“Yeah, I see them! A mother and her baby!”
The men clamored excitedly. Looking up, I saw them—about a hundred yards away in the hollow of a tall oak tree. My heart skipped a beat. It was her. And the infant... looking closely, it didn't look like a monkey at all. It looked exactly like a human baby. In that moment, the full weight of the truth hit me.
I noticed my companions were already leveling their rifles. The monkey, unaware she was being hunted, was simply basking in the sun. Panicked, I cried out, “Wait! Let me be the one to shoot her!”
“Oh? And why is that?”
“I don't care why! Just let me do it!”
Before they could object, I shouldered my gun and fired. My aim was true. The infant spun and fell from the tree. It was a meager atonement, but I could not bear to have my own child killed by a stranger’s hand. The mother let out a piercing shriek and glared at us with eyes like burning coals. I closed my eyes, unable to look. A second later, another man’s bullet pierced her heart.
I ignored the others and ran toward the tree, wrapped the small, human-like corpse in my jacket, and fled in the opposite direction. I could hear my companions shouting behind me, but I didn't stop. I went back to the ruins of the man's hut, dug into the earth, and buried the child.
I didn't crawl back to the village until the following morning. I refused to answer anyone's questions and, that very day, gave away my hunting gear for good. Since then, I have lived the life of a simple farmer. I never married; I have lived a life of total celibacy. From time to time, I secretly visit that site on Black Bear Mountain. Once, I was shocked to find a brand-new, nameless grave marker there—who could have placed it? Thirty years have passed, and the marker has rotted away, but I still wonder about the mystery of who else cared for that grave.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic mid-century Japanese magazine layout. It uses vertical text (tategaki) reading from right to left. The page is divided into multiple columns (three columns per page), which was standard for mass-market "pulp" or literary magazines.
*   **Typography:** The title "人間の子を生んだ猿の話" is written in a stylized, hand-drawn font that is thicker and more artistic than the body text, intended to catch the reader's eye. The body text uses a standard Mincho-style typeface common in lead type printing.
*   **Visual Elements:** A small, simplistic line drawing is placed between the title and the text. It depicts a creature that looks like a monkey or a fetal human-monkey hybrid, reinforcing the "uncanny" nature of the story.
*   **Sectioning:** The story is broken into numbered sections (3, 4, 5), suggesting this is either the latter half of a story or part of a serial.
*   **Punctuation and Symbols:** The text uses repetition marks (〃 or similar) and slashes (／＼) to indicate repeated onomatopoeia like "gasa-gasa" (rustling).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-war/Showa 20s):** The use of *kyū-kanazukai* (historical kana usage) like "ゐ" (wi), "ゑ" (we), and "さうして" (sōshite) combined with post-war themes suggests the late 1940s or early 1950s. This was a time when "Kasei" (popular/low-brow) literature flourished, often focusing on the grotesque, the supernatural, and the psychological (*ero-guro-nansensu* leftovers).
*   **The Uncanny Monkey:** In Japanese folklore, monkeys are often seen as "almost human." The idea of a human-animal hybrid (specifically with monkeys) is a recurring trope in *kaidan* (ghost stories) and folk tales, often used to explore themes of transgression and the "beast within."
*   **Jizo Bosatsu:** The mention of the Jizo statue (the protector of children and travelers) in the shrine is significant. The protagonist's inability to look at the "gentle face" of Jizo highlights his intense guilt and the feeling that he has committed a sin against the natural and divine order.
*   **The "Mountain Man":** Rural Japan often held myths about people living outside of society in the mountains (*yamabito*), who were sometimes associated with supernatural occurrences or bestiality.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **辻堂 (Tsujidō):** A small roadside shrine, often dedicated to Jizo, where travelers could rest.
*   **牝猿 (Mesuzaru):** A female monkey. The use of "牝" (usually for livestock/animals) contrasts with the "human" feelings the protagonist eventually projects onto her.
*   **身重 (Miomote):** An old-fashioned/polite way to say pregnant (literally "heavy with body").
*   **一丁 (Icchō):** A unit of length, roughly 109 meters. Its usage here shows the protagonist's background as a hunter/outdoorsman.
*   **爛々たる (Ranran-taru):** Glaring, fiery, or piercing eyes. Usually used to describe a predatory or vengeful gaze.
*   **贖罪 (Shokuzai):** Atonement or expiation for a sin.
*   **禁慾生活 (Kin'yoku seikatsu):** An ascetic or celibate life. This shows the long-term psychological damage and the "penance" the protagonist feels he must perform.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Monstrous/The Uncanny:** The story deals with the *Unheimlich* (the uncanny)—something familiar (a child) in an unfamiliar and "wrong" context (the womb of a monkey).
*   **Guilt and Repentance:** The protagonist’s life is defined by a single transgressive act (implied bestiality, though the text is slightly ambiguous/euphemistic about the actual encounter). His choice to kill the child himself is framed as a twisted form of mercy and "paternal" responsibility.
*   **Nature vs. Civilization:** The mountain represents a space where the rules of civilization break down. The protagonist's return to "farming" and "celibacy" in the village represents his attempt to re-enter a moral social order, though he is haunted by the "mountain" for 30 years.
*   **Ambiguity:** The ending, where a "new nameless grave marker" appears, suggests that either the "mountain man" survived and cared for the child's grave, or perhaps the protagonist's "delusion" had a reality that others acknowledged.
