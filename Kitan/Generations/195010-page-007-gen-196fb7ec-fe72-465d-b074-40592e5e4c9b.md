## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Main Title]**
Abnormality amorous display comparison.
The man who was made into a tonic (aphrodisiac).

**[Panel 1]**
At the paper wholesaler Naraya, a commuting head clerk named Tohei, a forty-year-old man, had for many years a strange hobby that he absolutely could not quit. That [hobby] was, going around to various mixed-gender public baths, any number of houses, and [finding] this...

**[Panel 2]**
...hand towel used by a woman he thought [was good], skillfully exchanging it with the one he possessed, and coming back to collect them. This was entirely his almost pathological hobby, and it was also a serious collection. Drying them one by one minutely, carefully applying a hand iron, the folded things were packed full into two dedicated wicker trunks.

**[Panel 3]**
While drinking the nightcap set at one *go* (approx. 180ml), waiting for his wife to fall asleep, taking out those hand towels by turns and gazing at them, thinking a little bit, or smelling that scent while grinning "niya-niya," he enjoyed himself indefinitely. It was on a certain evening. Returning from the shop to home as usual, Tohei, just like that hanging a towel "bura-ri" (idly), went to the nearby Choji-yu (Clove Bath).

**[Panel 4]**
Choji-yu (Bathhouse name)

**[Panel 5]**
Thinking that tonight, for the first time in a while, he'd like to run into a wonderful woman, soaking in the corner of the bathtub, he was without letting his guard down scouting around. Unfortunately, today's Choji-yu was extremely lacking in vividness (lively women).

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**A Comparison of Perverse Lusts: The Man Who Became an Aphrodisiac**

Tohei, a forty-year-old head clerk at the Naraya paper wholesaler, harbored a strange obsession that he had been unable to quit for years. His pastime consisted of wandering through various mixed-gender public bathhouses and surreptitiously swapping his own hand towels for those used by women who caught his eye. 

This was a truly pathological obsession for him, yet he pursued his "collection" with utmost seriousness. He would meticulously dry each stolen towel, carefully press them with a hand iron, and store them neatly folded in two large wicker trunks dedicated to his prize.

Every night, after drinking his usual cup of sake and waiting for his wife to drift off to sleep, he would pull out the towels one by one. He would spend hours lost in thought or grinning to himself as he inhaled their scent. One evening, after returning home from work, Tohei grabbed a towel and headed out to the neighborhood bathhouse, the Choji-yu.

As he soaked in a corner of the tub, he scanned the room with a predatory eye, hoping that tonight he might finally encounter a truly stunning woman. Unfortunately, the crowd at the Choji-yu that evening was decidedly uninspiring.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a dynamic, non-grid layout common in early post-war magazines. Panels are numbered (一 to 五) with hand-drawn borders.
*   **Typography:** The title uses heavy, stylized brush-lettering (Calligraphic) to evoke a sense of drama and perhaps a "traditional" Edo-period vibe, despite the modern setting. The body text is vertical, using a mixture of printed type and furigana (reading aids) for difficult kanji.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the largest element, placed on the right to grab the reader's attention first. The illustrations are interspersed with the text blocks to guide the eye through the narrative.
*   **Imagery:** The art style is "Heta-uma" (bad-but-good) or early *gekiga* style, with a focus on slightly voyeuristic or suggestive imagery (the naked back of the woman in Panel 5, the man smelling the towels). The clothing and interior suggest a late Meiji or Taisho-era aesthetic, though the "salaryman" context of a head clerk implies the early 20th century.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text likely originates from a "Kasutori" magazine. These were cheap, pulp magazines that flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–1952). They focused on the "3S" (Sex, Screen, and Sports) and often featured stories about "hentai" (abnormal) psychology or fetishes.
*   **Mixed Bathing (Konyoku):** While mixed bathing was officially banned or restricted in urban areas during the Meiji period to appease Western sensibilities, it persisted in many local bathhouses and rural areas. In pulp fiction, it served as a frequent setting for voyeuristic narratives.
*   **Tenugui (Hand Towels):** In this era, everyone brought their own thin cotton towel to the bath. These towels absorbed the "scent" of the user, making them a common object of fetishistic fixation in erotic literature of the time.
*   **The Title:** The word *Hentai* (変態) in this era referred more broadly to "abnormal psychology" or "perversion" in a pseudo-scientific or sensationalist sense, rather than the modern Western association solely with anime pornography.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **道樂 (Douraku):** Usually means a hobby, but often carries the connotation of a "vice" or a ruinous indulgence (like gambling or womanizing).
*   **葛籠 (Tsuzura):** A traditional storage basket made of bamboo or vine, often lacquered. Using these for "stolen goods" adds a touch of secretiveness to his hobby.
*   **火のし (Hinoshi):** An old-fashioned iron that consisted of a metal pan filled with hot coals.
*   **生彩に乏しかった (Seisai ni toboshikatta):** Literally "lacking in vividness/brilliance." In this context, it means there were no attractive or "lively" women at the bathhouse that day.
*   **一合 (Ichigo):** A standard unit for sake (approx. 180ml). "Set at one go" implies he's a disciplined drinker—ironic given his lack of discipline regarding his fetish.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Fetishism and Obsession:** The story explicitly labels the protagonist's behavior as "pathological" (病的な). It explores the private world of a man who appears normal to society (a head clerk) but harbors a secret, deviant life.
*   **Voyeurism and Stealth:** The thrill for the character comes from the "skillful" (巧みに) theft and the subsequent sensory indulgence (smelling the towels) in private. It highlights the tension between public behavior (the bathhouse) and private desire.
*   **The Mundane vs. The Erotic:** The protagonist is a "forty-year-old man" and a "head clerk"—very ordinary roles. The subtext suggests that "perversion" can be found within the most mundane characters of urban life.
