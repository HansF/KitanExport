**[ルポルタージュ部分]**
**スリ踊る：カミソリ能**
だが、熟練した幹部級になると一回で軽く三万円位は上げる。貧乏サラリーマンの三ヶ月分の月給が、ほんの一瞬の指先の芸術でせしめられるのだから、すごいものである。
親分は手を出さない。子分が稼いでくる金を全部プールして、分配してやるのが仕事であって、その割り高は、一ヶ月収入で：
親分：約百万円
幹部：約十万円
準幹部：約三、四万円
一般（稼ぎ高に応じて）：約一、二万円
といったところが相場になっている。
百万円の月収と言えばいかにもボロいようだが（税金はいらないから）、やはり「内（刑務所）」へ入るとそれ相当の費用がかさむもので、親分も子分も始終検挙されて刑務所へ入ったり出たりするのに忙しいから、保釈金とか差し入れ代の支出がバカにならない。百万円稼いでも、まあ収支差し引けばトントンというところらしいから、素人が考えるほど気楽な稼業ではない。

3. 熟練者は減る一方
今のスリは、とても昔の「仕立屋銀次」なんて言うような鮮やかな技術は持っていない。この間、る親分に会ったら、

と、大いにスリ道の堕落を嘆いていたくらいだから思いやられる。その代わり暴力団化してきたことも甚だしく、大体四、五人から七、八人が一組になり、一人の「ホシ（標的）」を見つけると、これを取り囲み、袋叩きにするか、ドスでおどかして、金や物を強奪し、次々にリレー式に渡して逃げてゆくのが多い。（朝鮮人のアリラン隊にこれが特に多いのは前述の通りである）
以上は「平場師（ひらばし）」の場合だが、今度は「箱師（はこし）」の手口を突いてみると……

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Fiction]**
"Your name is?"
"Oh, my name [you] forgot? Tokiko is what [I] am called. It is Tokiko, remember [it] okay."
Haruo, every time [he] stumbled, touched her roundly ripened body, and somehow, excitedly [his] chest danced.
Turning the corner of Onoda Watch Store on West Ginza Street, [they] made two turns on a dim road and opened the glass door of the house in front.
"It's here."
Tokiko turned around and urged him. Guided by a woman who looked like a proprietress, [they] entered a room on the second floor.
At the end of the hallway, it was a calm room in the style of a small restaurant. In the alcove, though [he] did not know the name, fresh flowers that looked like they had just been arranged were inserted.
(Omitted)
The woman from before brought sake and food, and saying "If there is business, press this bell," immediately went down.
"Please drink steadily."
Tokiko offered the cup to him. Her large, moist-looking eyes were singularly charming. It is strange, a woman who takes such actions. No matter how [he] tries, [he] cannot remember.
Even when Haruo thought of women [he] had relationships with in the past, [he] could not remember.
[He] was just looking at her face with hollow eyes.
"Oh, no, looking only at my face."
"It's just that, you are too beautiful."
"My, Mr. Segawa, [you] are very good at flattery."
"No, it's not flattery. In reality, you are beautiful."
Before [he] knew it, Tokiko was leaning on his lap.
"I am happy to meet Mr. Segawa. Mr. Segawa, [do you] dislike me?"
"No, I like you very much."
"But Mr. Segawa, [you] must have a beautiful wife."
"Wife, [I] have none. I am still single."
Haruo, leaving it to the momentum, said so, and thought "Oops," but at that time...
"I am happy, Mr. Segawa, forever, okay."
And Tokiko boldly snuggled up.
(Omitted)
In the moonless night sky, stars flowed drawing threads beautifully. Late at night when there are no people passing...

**[Article]**
**Pickpockets Dance: Razor Blade Skill**
But, when becoming a skilled executive class, in one time [they] lightly raise about 30,000 yen. Because a poor salaryman's three months' worth of monthly salary can be snatched by a mere moment's fingertip art, it is a staggering thing.
The boss does not put out [his] hand. Pooling all the money the subordinates earn and distributing it is the job; that high share is, in one month's income:
Boss: approx. 1,000,000 yen
Executive: approx. 100,000 yen
Semi-executive: approx. 30,000-40,000 yen
General (according to earnings): approx. 10,000-20,000 yen
That is the market rate.
Speaking of a monthly income of one million yen, it seems quite lucrative (since taxes are not needed), but as expected, when entering the "inside" (prison), corresponding expenses pile up, and because both boss and subordinates are busy entering and leaving prison by being arrested constantly, expenditures for bail and supplies are not negligible. Even if [they] earn a million yen, well, if [you] subtract income and outgo, it seems it is just about breaking even, so it is not as easy a life as an amateur thinks.

3. Skilled ones are only decreasing
Today's pickpockets do not have brilliant techniques like those of "Shitateya Ginji" of old. Recently, when [I] met a certain boss:
"It's no good, the young ones these days. Those who can do 'Suri-chigai' (the method of picking a wallet from the breast pocket the moment of bumping into someone) are only about 10 people in all of Osaka. The remaining 2,000 people can't even remove a watch's clasp (chain) and make blunders like cutting it with pliers."
He was lamenting the degradation of the "Way of the Pickpocket" to such an extent. In exchange, the shift toward becoming violent gangs is extreme; generally 4-5 to 7-8 people form a group, find one "star" (target), surround them, beat them up, or threaten them with a dagger to rob money and goods, passing them in a relay style to flee. (As mentioned before, this is especially common in the Korean 'Arirang Brigade').
The above is the case of "Hiraba-shi" (street specialists), but next, when looking into the methods of "Hako-shi" (train specialists)...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**[Fiction: A Night in Ginza]**
"What was your name again?"
"Oh, have you already forgotten? It’s Tokiko. Tokiko—make sure you remember it this time."
Every time Haruo stumbled, he brushed against her soft, full figure, and his heart pounded with a strange, fluttering excitement. They turned the corner at the Onoda Watch Store on West Ginza Street, navigated two turns down a dim alleyway, and opened the glass door of the house directly ahead.
"We’re here," Tokiko said, turning back to beckon him inside. A woman who looked like the house mistress led them upstairs to a room. It was a quiet, refined space at the end of the hall, reminiscent of a traditional restaurant. In the alcove stood an arrangement of vivid, fresh flowers—Haruo didn't know their name, but they looked as if they had just been cut.
(Omitted)
The woman returned with sake and food. "If you need anything, just press this bell," she said before heading back downstairs.
"Drink up, don't be shy," Tokiko said, offering him a cup. Her large, misty eyes were singularly captivating. She was a mysterious woman; Haruo searched his memory for any past connection but could find none. He could only stare blankly at her face.
"Oh, stop it. Don't just stare at me like that."
"I can't help it. You’re just too beautiful."
"My, Mr. Segawa, you certainly are a smooth talker."
"No, I’m not flattering you. You truly are beautiful."
Before he knew it, Tokiko was leaning against his knee. "I’m so happy to be with you, Mr. Segawa. Do you... dislike me?"
"No, I like you very much."
"But surely you have a beautiful wife at home?"
"I don't have a wife. I'm still single." Haruo spoke on impulse, and immediately thought, *Damn it,* but by then it was too late.
"I'm so glad, Mr. Segawa. Let's stay like this forever." Tokiko snuggled up to him boldly.
(Omitted)
Under a moonless sky, stars streaked through the air like shimmering threads. It was deep into the night, and the streets were empty...

**[Article: The Pickpockets’ Dance — The Art of the Razor]**
When a pickpocket reaches the elite "executive" rank, they can easily pull in 30,000 yen in a single hit. It’s a staggering thought—the equivalent of three months' salary for a poor office worker, snatched away in a split-second "masterpiece" of the fingertips.
The Big Boss never gets his own hands dirty. His job is to pool the money his subordinates bring in and distribute it. The monthly "market rate" for these shares is roughly as follows:
*   **The Boss:** ~1,000,000 yen
*   **Executive:** ~100,000 yen
*   **Semi-Executive:** ~30,000 to 40,000 yen
*   **Common Thief:** ~10,000 to 20,000 yen (depending on their haul)
A million-yen monthly income sounds like a "cushy" deal (especially since it's tax-free), but the reality of the "underworld" is that expenses pile up. Since both bosses and subordinates are constantly being pinched and cycling in and out of prison, the costs for bail and "care packages" (items sent into jail) are astronomical. After balancing the books, even a million-yen earner reportedly only breaks even. It’s not nearly as carefree a life as a layman might imagine.

**3. The Decline of the Master Craftsman**
Today’s pickpockets lack the brilliant finesse of legendary figures like "Shitateya Ginji." I recently spoke with an old boss who lamented the state of the craft:
"The kids these days are hopeless. In all of Osaka, there are maybe ten guys left who can pull off a proper 'Suri-chigai' (snatching a wallet from a breast pocket while passing someone). The other two thousand can't even unclip a watch chain; they resort to clumsy blunders like cutting them with pliers."
The "Way of the Pickpocket" has clearly fallen into ruin. In place of skill, we see a rise in brute force. Groups of four to eight men now surround a single "star" (target), either beating them senseless or threatening them with daggers to rob them of everything. They then escape by passing the loot off in a relay. (As mentioned, this is particularly common among the Korean "Arirang Brigades").
These are the methods of the "Hiraba-shi" (street specialists); next, let's examine the "Hako-shi" (train specialists)...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** This is a classic "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine layout. The page is split horizontally into two distinct sections. The top features a romantic/erotic narrative with a large illustration, while the bottom contains a sensationalist "true crime" or sociological report.
*   **Typography:** The titles use stylized, bold fonts. "仕色" (Shishoku - *Work & Color/Love*) is at the top right, while "スリ踊る" (*Pickpockets Dance*) uses a more aggressive, dynamic font at the bottom right.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustrations are placed to the left (top) and right (bottom), creating a balanced but busy visual field. The use of a decorative border (scalloped line) between the two sections clearly demarcates the "Fiction" from the "Reportage."
*   **Formatting Elements:** The pickpocket section uses a bulleted list for the income breakdown, which draws the eye to the sensational financial figures (1,000,000 yen).
*   **Text Direction:** Standard vertical Tategaki (top-to-bottom, right-to-left).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII/1950s):** The mention of "30,000 yen" as three months' salary for a "poor salaryman" places this firmly in the early to mid-1950s. At that time, a starting salary for a college graduate was roughly 10,000 yen.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This term refers to cheap, pulpy magazines popular after the war, known for a mix of "3 S's": Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports (or Sensationalism). This page perfectly encapsulates that mix of light erotica and crime exposé.
*   **Shitateya Ginji (仕立屋銀次):** Mentioned as the gold standard of pickpockets, he was a real historical figure from the Meiji/Taisho era known as the "King of Pickpockets" for his incredible dexterity.
*   **Arirang Brigade (アリラン隊):** This is a derogatory or period-specific term for ethnic Koreans in Japan. In the post-war chaos, ethnic minorities were often scapegoated in the press for organized crime and black market activities.
*   **Ginza Context:** "West Ginza" and "Onoda Watch Store" (a real establishment) ground the fiction in a recognizable, high-class urban setting, contrasting with the seedy underworld described below.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **妾 (Wara/Watashi):** Used by the female lead. While archaically "concubine," in this period's fiction, it was often used as a feminine first-person pronoun by women in the "water trade" (nightlife).
*   **おセイジ (O-seiji):** Flattery. Written with katakana for emphasis/style.
*   **スリ (Suri):** Pickpocket.
*   **親分/子分 (Oyabun/Kobun):** Boss and subordinate (typical Yakuza/underworld hierarchy).
*   **内 (Uchi):** Literally "inside," but in this context, underworld slang for prison.
*   **トントン (Ton-ton):** To break even; neither profit nor loss.
*   **スリチガイ (Suri-chigai):** A specific pickpocketing technique where the thief hits the mark while passing them in a crowd.
*   **ナスカン (Nasukan):** A lobster-claw clasp or swivel hook, commonly used on watch chains.
*   **ホシ (Hoshi):** Slang for the target or victim (in modern police slang, it means the suspect, but here it's the "mark").
*   **平場師 (Hiraba-shi) vs. 箱師 (Hako-shi):** "Hiraba-shi" are pickpockets who work open streets/festivals. "Hako-shi" (literally "box-specialists") are those who work inside trains or buses.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Nostalgia vs. Modern Decay:** The article laments the "loss of skill" in modern pickpockets, framing old-school thieves as "artists" while painting modern ones as mere thugs. This "decline of craftsmanship" is a common trope in underworld reporting.
*   **Economic Inequality:** The text explicitly contrasts the "poor salaryman" with the "million-yen boss," highlighting the economic desperation and the lure of crime in post-war Japan.
*   **Seduction & Deception:** The fiction section explores the "honey trap" or "nightlife romance" theme, where a man is lured by a woman he vaguely remembers, leading to potential moral or financial ruin.
*   **Urban Sophistication:** The mention of Ginza and specific shops adds a layer of "city life" allure that was a major selling point for these magazines.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Romance/Drama), Magazine Column (Reportage/Exposé).
*   **Primary Tags:** Post-war Japan, Underworld, Pickpockets, Ginza, Pulp Fiction, Crime Sociology, Urban Life.
