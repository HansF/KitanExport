二、刑事の悩みは深かった

二月二十二日、夕闇迫る阿倍野警察の司法室で、江本刑事は、よく肥えた布袋の様な身体で、あぐらを描き深く腕をこまねいて悩み抜いていた。阿倍野一帯の不良を戦慄させる「オヤジ」は決して猛々しい容貌でなく、温順柔和な、半白の頭髪の重顔の老紳士だったのである。
刑事の向い側には、何か真赤になって喚きたてる十六七のニキビだらけの中学生とそれより一つ二つ年上と見える、貧しい服装の女學生が泣き崩れていた。
「怪しからん女學生です。地下鐵の混雑にまぎれて、僕の制服のポッケットから、二百四十圓も入つてる革口を掬おうとしたんです。一緒にポッケットに突つこんでいた雑誌が、がつと動いたので、気づいて、引つかまえました。」
「すみません、家が貧乏で、どうしても明日要る學校の授業料が拂えないのです。どうしやう～と一日心配していたのです。そして、そして、ついふらふらと夢中で、この人のポッケットに手を入れました。刑事さん堪忍して。二度とこんな怖ろしい悪いことはいたしませんから。出来心の上に、ちようど今、生理日の最中なのです。」
は、身すぼらしい身なりの清純な處女の微罪に對して、その處置を思い悩むのだった。
素人娘の初犯であり、しかも失敗しているのだ。動機も授業料に追われているためであり、おまけに精神的變調のある月経中なのである。江本刑事にむ同年代の娘がある。清廉潔白で通る刑事は、勤續二十年、公務の上では大阪切つてのスリ狩の名人と激賞され、幾度か表彰されていたが私生活は清貧そのものだつた。警察官としての簿給に加えて、貧しい者病める者に對しては、その薄給を割いても救助せずに居れない神のような性格だつたのである。
将来こんな誤ちを犯さない決心はありありと、女學生の悔恨の涙の中に見えるのだ。二百二百圓位なら、會計から給料の前借をしてでも與えてやりたい。子をもつ江本刑事は海のような慈父の温情を湛えているのだった。
しかし･･････。何故か刑事の鋭敏な警察官特有の第六感は、そうした個人の感情を越えて、何か割りきれない不審を感じるののだ。
ぐったりとうなだれて啜り泣く女學生の姿態を、さりげなく凝視していた刑事の眼は急にきらりと光つた！
判つた。どうしても解けなかつた不審を見事に解決したのだ。刑事の視線は、女學生の制服の襟元に注がれ、次に、深いしづかな呼吸で、女學生の肉体の周囲に匂うものを嗅ぎ始めたのである。
「う、ははは･･････化けたな、みごとに化けたな」
最初の微かなふくみ笑いが、次第次第に、大きな笑聲となり、刑事は終いに、腹を抱え、象のように眼を細くして笑い轉げた。
「おい！飛んでもない辨天小僧だつたなあ、白状するがいいよ、え、痛い眼はさせたくないからなあ･･････」
びくつと顔を擧げた女學生の眼と笑いの中に鋼鐵のような冷たいものが輝く刑事の眼が、真正面から白熱化した火華を散らして衝突した。
「ふん、お前の首筋の白粉焼けは何だ、肌衣に泌みこんでいるウビガンの香水の匂いはなんだ、貧乏な家のまじめな女學生が、そんなパンパンガールのような化粧をするか！え、それから、お前の･･････」
と言いかけた刑事は、傍らで好奇の表情で聞き耳を澄ましている、被害者の中學生へ、ひよいとあごをしやくつた。
「君はもう帰りたまへ、要らない澤山な小遣銭を両親からせびつて、阿倍野界隈を遊びまわるんじゃないよ學生は勉強が大切だ！」
ほうほうの態で司法室を飛び出す中學生を見送つて、向き直つた刑事は不正を断じて許さぬ火を噴く激しい言葉を叩きつけた。
「お前の豊かな乳房、丸い肩、よく肥つた膝など、それが男を知らぬ綺麗な處女だと言い張れるか。男の肌を幾度か味わつて成熟し切つた女じやないか。え、さつぱりと白状しろ。この江本の眼は竹筒じやないぞしかも、ぬけ～と授業料だの、月中だの、四十男のこのおれの心の隙に忍びこもうとする技巧は、お前が、煮ても焼いても食えぬ商賣女だと云う證據だ！出来心の初犯などと、ぬけ～とどの口で言えるのだ。どうだ、これでもふといシッポを隠しおわすつもりか！」
問いつめられ、追いこまれた女學生の蒼白の顔は、見破られた屈辱と後悔に、激しく鮮紅に染まつた。眼はぎらりと山猫のように妖しく輝き、唇は血の滲むほど噛みしめられていた。

三、美少女の謎は解けた

「敗けた！やつぱりあたしの油断だ―一週間前に、忠告された通りだつた。」
悲痛な敗北の壁が洩れた。女學生を装つて固く揃えていた膝が、がくりと横に崩れた。
「江本さんは怖ろしい。みごとな閻星を指されました。白状しましょう。あたしは、江本さんに狙われていた阪神カスリー一家三人の一人、マサ公なんです。戸籍通りなら川口マサ子、年は十九、去年の十一月から大阪地下鐵を荒らしまわつていたのです。」
「うむ、そうか。おれのメガネ通り雑魚じやなかつたなあ、それで、あとの二人はだれだ―なのだい。」
「おキヨ、本名は青村キヨ子、年は

2. The Detective's Worry was Deep

February 22nd, in the judicial room of the Abeno Police [Station] as evening darkness approached, Detective Enmoto, with a well-fattened Hotei-like body, was sitting cross-legged, deeply folding his arms and worrying intensely. The "Old Man" who made the delinquents of the entire Abeno area tremble was by no means a fierce-looking person, but rather a mild and gentle, half-white-haired, heavy-faced old gentleman.
On the opposite side of the detective, a 16 or 17-year-old middle school student covered in acne was shouting with a bright red face, and a schoolgirl appearing one or two years older than him, in poor clothing, was breaking down in tears.
"It is an outrageous schoolgirl. Mingling in the subway congestion, from my uniform pocket, she tried to scoop a leather wallet containing as much as 240 yen. Because the magazine I had thrust into the same pocket moved with a 'gatsu' [thud], I noticed and caught [her]."
"I am sorry, my home is poor, and no matter what, I cannot pay the school tuition needed tomorrow. 'What shall I do,' I have been worrying all day. And then, and then, unintentionally, in a daze, I put my hand in this person's pocket. Detective-san, please forgive me. I will never do such a scary bad thing again. On top of it being a sudden impulse, just now, I am in the middle of my menstrual period."
[The detective] was worrying about the disposal of this petty crime by a pure maiden in shabby appearance.
It is a first offense of an amateur girl, and moreover, she failed. The motive is also being chased by tuition, and on top of that, it is during menstruation which has mental fluctuations. Detective Enmoto also has a daughter of the same age. The detective, known for being incorruptible, with 20 years of service, was praised as the best pickpocket-hunter in Osaka in his official duties and had been commended several times, but his private life was poverty itself. In addition to his meager salary as a police officer, toward the poor and the sick, he had a god-like personality where he could not stay without helping even by splitting that meager salary.
The determination not to commit such an error in the future is clearly visible in the schoolgirl's tears of remorse. If it is about 240 yen, he wants to give it to her even by taking an advance on his salary from accounting. Detective Enmoto, who has a child, was overflowing with the warm affection of a father like the sea.
But... For some reason, the detective's sharp sixth sense peculiar to police officers, transcending such individual emotions, felt some unresolvable suspicion.
The detective's eyes, which were casually scrutinizing the form of the schoolgirl sobbing with a slumped head, suddenly flashed!
He understood. He brilliantly solved the suspicion that could not be solved no matter what. The detective's gaze was poured onto the collar of the schoolgirl's uniform, and next, with a deep, quiet breath, he began to sniff the things smelling around the schoolgirl's body.
"Ha, haha... You transformed, you transformed brilliantly."
The first faint chuckle gradually became a large laughing voice, and the detective finally held his stomach, narrowed his eyes like an elephant, and rolled over laughing.
"Hey! You were quite the Benten Kozo, weren't you? You should confess, eh, because I don't want to make you experience a painful time..."
The schoolgirl's eyes, which jerked her face up, and the detective's eyes, in which something cold like steel shone amidst the laughter, clashed head-on, scattering incandescent sparks.
"Humph, what is that 'white powder burn' on your neck? What is that smell of Ubigan perfume soaking into your undergarments? Does a serious schoolgirl from a poor home wear such makeup like a Panpan girl! Eh, and then, your..."
The detective, who was about to say [more], flicked his chin toward the victim, the middle school student, who was listening intently with a curious expression nearby.
"You, go home already. Don't go around playing in the Abeno area by pestering your parents for unnecessary large amounts of pocket money. For students, studying is important!"
Watching the middle school student fly out of the judicial room in a state of confusion, the detective, turning back, slammed down fierce words spitting fire that absolutely does not permit injustice.
"Those rich breasts of yours, round shoulders, well-fattened knees and such—can you insist that those belong to a beautiful virgin who knows not men? Aren't you a woman who has fully matured, having tasted the skin of men several times? Confess cleanly. These eyes of Enmoto are not bamboo tubes [hollow/blind]! Moreover, the technique of trying to sneak into the gap of the heart of this forty-year-old man by shamelessly [talking about] tuition and being mid-month is proof that you are a professional woman who is hard to deal with! With what mouth can you say things like 'first offense of sudden impulse'? How is it, do you still intend to keep hiding your thick tail!"
Pressed and cornered, the schoolgirl's pale face stained intensely bright red with the humiliation and regret of being seen through. Her eyes shone eerily like a wildcat, and her lips were bitten so hard that blood seeped out.

3. The Mystery of the Beautiful Girl was Solved

"I lost! It was my carelessness after all—it was just as I was warned a week ago."
A voice of painful defeat leaked out. Her knees, which she had kept tightly together while pretending to be a schoolgirl, collapsed sideways with a 'gakuri'.
"Enmoto-san is terrifying. You pointed a magnificent checkmate [Enyose]. I will confess. I am one of the three of the 'Hanshin Kasuri Family' who was being targeted by Enmoto-san, Masa-ko. According to the family register, Kawaguchi Masako, age 19. Since last November, I have been ravaging the Osaka subway."
"Umu, I see. As my glasses [judgment] told me, you weren't small fry. So, who are the other two?"
"O-kyo, real name Aimura Kiyoko, age..."

**Part II: The Detective’s Dilemma**

February 22nd. As twilight descended upon the Abeno Police Station, Detective Enmoto sat in the judicial chambers, his stout, Buddha-like frame huddled in a cross-legged position. His arms were folded deep, lost in thought. To the local hoods of Abeno, he was known as "The Old Man," a name that struck terror into their hearts. Yet, he did not look the part of a fierce hunter; he was a mild-mannered, silver-haired gentleman with a dignified, heavy-set face.

Facing him were two others: a sixteen-year-old boy, face flushed red and speckled with acne, shouting indignantly, and a schoolgirl a year or two his senior. Dressed in threadbare clothes, she was a crumpled heap of tears.

"She’s a disgrace to the uniform!" the boy barked. "She used the crowd in the subway to pick my pocket. She was trying to lift my leather wallet—it had 240 yen in it. I had a magazine shoved in the same pocket, and when it shifted suddenly, I caught her red-handed."

"Please, forgive me!" she sobbed. "My family is so poor, and I couldn't find a way to pay my tuition for tomorrow. I’ve been out of my mind with worry all day. Then... then... I don't know what came over me. I just reached in. Please, Detective, have mercy! I'll never do anything this terrible again. It was a moment of weakness... and I’m... well, it’s my time of the month, and I’m not myself."

The detective gazed at her, torn. Before him was a seemingly pure maiden, driven to a petty crime by desperation. She was a rank amateur, and she had failed. Her motive was sympathetic—tuition fees—and she was suffering the emotional instability of her cycle. Enmoto had a daughter of the same age. Though a twenty-year veteran lauded as Osaka’s greatest pickpocket-catcher, his personal life was one of "honest poverty." Despite his meager salary, he was known for a saint-like generosity, often parting with his own pay to help the sick and the destitute.

He saw the genuine remorse in her tears. For the sake of a mere 240 yen, he felt tempted to give her an advance on his own pay just to set things right. The detective, ever the father figure, felt a sea of paternal compassion swelling within him.

And yet... something nagged at his sharp, professional intuition. Beyond his personal sympathy, a cold, unexplainable doubt lingered.

As he watched the girl sob, her head bowed in exhaustion, his eyes suddenly flashed with a sharp light. He had found it. The missing piece of the puzzle. His gaze dropped to the collar of her uniform, and then, taking a slow, deep breath, he began to scent the air around her.

"Ha... ha-ha-ha! Quite a performance! A truly magnificent transformation!"

What began as a low chuckle erupted into a booming laugh. Enmoto doubled over, holding his belly, his eyes crinkling like an elephant’s as he roared with mirth.

"Well now! You’re quite the little Benten Kozo, aren't you? Come on, spill it. I’d hate to have to get rough with you..."

The girl’s head jerked up. Her eyes met the detective’s—the warmth was gone, replaced by a gaze as cold and hard as forged steel. The air between them crackled with the intensity of an electric spark.

"Tell me," he sneered, "what’s with the 'powder burn' on your neck? And that scent of Ubigan perfume clinging to your slip? Does a poor, 'serious' schoolgirl wear the makeup of a Panpan streetwalker? And furthermore, your—"

He broke off, jerking his chin toward the pockmarked schoolboy who was leaning in with morbid curiosity.

"You—get out of here. Stop pestering your parents for pocket money just so you can loiter around Abeno. A student’s job is to study!"

As the boy scurried out in a panic, the detective turned back to the girl, his voice now a scorching flame that brooked no deception.

"Those full breasts, those rounded shoulders, those well-fed knees... do you really expect me to believe you’re an innocent virgin? You have the body of a woman who has tasted the skin of men many times over. Confess! My eyes aren't made of glass. This whole act—the tuition, the monthly cycle—it’s all a calculated play for a forty-year-old man’s sympathy. It’s the hallmark of a hardened professional. 'A moment of weakness'? Don't make me laugh. Now, are you going to show your true colors, or do I have to drag them out of you?"

The girl’s face, once pale, flushed a deep, violent crimson—not from shame, but from the humiliation of being caught. Her eyes glinted with the predatory light of a wildcat, and she bit her lip until the blood began to bead.

**Part III: The Mystery is Solved**

"I lost. I let my guard down... just like I was warned a week ago."

The words of defeat escaped her. The knees she had kept so demurely together collapsed. 

"You’re terrifying, Detective Enmoto. You’ve played a perfect checkmate. I’ll talk. I’m 'Masa-ko,' one of the trio from the Hanshin Kasuri Gang you’ve been hunting. My real name is Kawaguchi Masako, nineteen years old. I’ve been working the Osaka subways since last November."

"I thought so," Enmoto grunted. "My instincts told me you weren't small fry. Now, tell me about the other two."

"There’s O-kyo—real name Aimura Kiyoko. She’s..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The text is presented in a classic three-column vertical format (*tategaki*), typical of Japanese magazines and newspapers. The font is a standard Mincho-style serif, which provides high readability but feels formal and authoritative.
*   **Headlines:** The headers use a slightly larger, bolder font and are numbered (二、三), indicating a serialized story or a multi-part feature.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "28" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is part of a larger publication. There is a lack of illustrations in this specific section, placing the emphasis entirely on the narrative prose.
*   **Punctuation & Formatting:** Use of double brackets (「 」) for dialogue and specific emphasis marks like the "dash-dash" (―) and the "leader dots" (･･････) for dramatic pauses are common in pulp fiction of this era. 
*   **Design Features:** The aging of the paper (yellowing, foxing) and the slightly "muddy" quality of the ink suggest a mid-century printing process (likely letterpress) on inexpensive paper, characteristic of *Kasutori* (dregs) magazines.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Japan):** The mention of "240 yen" as a significant sum and the "Abeno" area (a major hub in Osaka) places the story in the early post-war period. 240 yen in the late 1940s would be roughly equivalent to a few days' wages for a laborer.
*   **Panpan Girls (パンパンガール):** This was a slang term for streetwalkers who catered primarily to American GI forces during the occupation. The detective uses this term to contrast the girl's "schoolgirl" disguise with her perceived "corrupted" reality.
*   **Social Conventions & Stigma:** The girl attempts to use "menstruation" (生理) as a defense, appealing to the period's belief that women were mentally unstable or physically weakened during their cycle. The detective sees through this as a "professional" tactic.
*   **Identity & Disguise:** Post-war Japan saw a rise in "Juvenile Delinquency" (*furyō*). The trope of a criminal disguised as a "pure schoolgirl" was a common theme in crime fiction, reflecting social anxieties about the breakdown of traditional morality.
*   **Benten Kozo (辨天小僧):** A reference to a famous character in Kabuki, a young man who disguises himself as a beautiful girl to extort money.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **布袋 (Hotei):** One of the Seven Lucky Gods, depicted with a large belly. Used here to describe the detective’s physique.
*   **白粉焼け (Oshiroi-yake):** Literally "powder burn." It refers to the skin damage or staining caused by long-term use of lead-based or heavy traditional white makeup (*oshiroi*), a tell-tale sign of a professional entertainer or prostitute.
*   **ウビガン (Ubigan/Houbigant):** A famous French perfume brand (Houbigant). Its presence on a "poor student" is a major red flag.
*   **竹筒 (Taketsutsu):** Literally "bamboo tube." Used idiomatically (often as *fushiana* or "knothole") to mean "my eyes are not hollow/blind."
*   **王手 (Ōte):** A move in Shogi equivalent to "Check" in Chess.
*   **阪神カスリ一家 (Hanshin Kasuri-ikka):** "Kasuri" often refers to a patterned fabric, but here it is likely the name of a fictional crime syndicate or gang operating in the Hanshin (Osaka-Kobe) area.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Purity vs. Corruption:** The core conflict is the detective’s struggle between his paternalistic desire to see "purity" and his professional obligation to uncover "corruption."
*   **Masculinity & Intuition:** The detective is portrayed as a "慈父" (compassionate father) but also a master of a hyper-masculine, "hard-boiled" intuition that pierces through feminine deception.
*   **The "Fallen" Woman:** The text reflects a judgmental view of women who have "tasted the skin of men." Her physical maturation (breasts, shoulders) is used as forensic evidence of her moral status.
*   **Poverty as a Mask:** The story highlights the cynicism of the era—where the very real suffering of the poor (inability to pay tuition) is co-opted by criminals as a tool for manipulation.
