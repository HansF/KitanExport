## Original Japanese (Verbatim Transcription)

ある雨の日――みつ子は昼さがりに風呂へ行った。湯上がりの肌は雨の滴にも脆くそこなわれそうに柔らかい。
「今日はサービスよ」汗でいっそうしなやかな指がまたしても僕の指にからむ。
「サービスって何だい？」
「恋人ごっこよ……ね、いいでしょ。久しぶりのお休みなんですもの」
というわけで、二人は一本しかない傘をさし、抱き合うようにして近くの便所臭い映画館へ行った。

ところが、日暮れにどしゃ降りの雨のなかを戻る道々、「こわかったわ」と、みつ子が肩をすぼめてささやいた。
「どうしたのさ」
「映画館のなかで……」
「恋人ごっこやったじゃないか？」
「ええ……でも、あなたはあたしの左の手ばかりいじってらしたでしょう？　あのとき、何かお気づきにならなかった？」
「いや、僕は君の体と映画ばかりに気をとられていたからね」
「あたし、ときどきあなたの反対側……右のほうへ体をぐいぐい引っぱられたの……」
「どうしたんだ、いったい？　痴漢でもいたのか」

「ゴリラよ……うちのゴリラ公なのよ…」
「え？　ゴリラって……うちの親方のことかい。奴もきていたのか」
「そうなの。明るくなる前にそっと帰って行ったわ」
「あれが、どうしたんだね」
「……こわいわ。口にするのも。あなたお怒りになる？」
「だからさ、いったい何があったんだ」
「あたしたちが入ったとき、ちょうど画面が暗かったので、となりにどんな人がいたか、知らずにあいている席にならんだでしょう」
「うん、右も左もまっくらだったね」

「そうしたら、間もなく、だれか太った人が途中であたしの右のほうへ坐ったの……やがてモゾモゾ体を動かしはじめ、あたしの手をそっとにぎったり、ギュッと握ったり……とてもゴツい指だったわ」
「へえ、知らなかったよ。なぜ、僕にいわなかったんだ」
「だって、あなたはきっと、大きな声でどなるでしょう……こまるわ」
「こまるって……ヘンだぞ……ヘンじゃないか」

「だって、親方だとわかったのよ。おかげであたしの手、汗でクチャクチャになってしまったわ。そのうえ親方ったら、ぐんぐん自分の体のほうへあたしの手を引っぱるんですもの……〝奥さん、旦那にゃ内緒だぜ〟って耳こすりまでしながら……」
「で、どうした？　さわられたのか？」
「だって、あんまり強い力なので、あたし…指がもげそうだったのよ……親方の体、本当にゴリラみたいに、熱くって、凄かったわ…」

**襖の向うで秘事が**

僕は気が狂いそうになった。息ばかり烈しくなり、胸がつまりそうでもある。
その夜、いつものようにみつ子の柔らかな下半身を松葉形に、僕の脚できつく緊めつけているのだが、すこしもやさしい欲望はわいてこない。むしろどす黒い特異な感情に胸が焼けてくるだけだ。
畜生！　と歯ぎしりしても、相手は家主であり逞しい仕事師だ。どうにもならない。
体じゅうがふるえてくる。ふと、みつ子の肌にふれた指の先が、熱い沼のなかにおかれたようだった。
かわいい僕の人形は、事前に、しかも何の

ある雨の日――みつ子は昼下がりに風呂へ行った。湯上がりの肌は雨の滴にも脆く損なわれそうに柔らかい。
「今日はサービスよ」汗で一層しなやかな指がまたしても僕の指に絡む。
「サービスって何だい？」
「恋人ごっこよ……ね、いいでしょ。久しぶりのお休みなんですもの」
というわけで、二人は一本しかない傘をさし、抱き合うようにして近くの便所臭い映画館へ行った。

ところが、日暮れに土砂降りの雨の中を戻る道々、「怖かったわ」と、みつ子が肩をすぼめて囁いた。
「どうしたのさ」
「映画館の中で……」
「恋人ごっこやったじゃないか？」
「ええ……でも、あなたはあたしの左の手ばかりいじってらしたでしょう？　あのとき、何かお気づきにならなかった？」
「いや、僕は君の体と映画ばかりに気をとられていたからね」
「あたし、ときどきあなたの反対側……右のほうへ体をぐいぐい引っ張られたの……」

「だからさ、いったい何があったんだ」
「あたしたちが入ったとき、ちょうど画面が暗かったので、隣にどんな人がいたか、知らずに空いている席に並んだでしょう」
「うん、右も左も真っ暗だったね」

「そうしたら、間もなく、誰か太った人が途中であたしの右のほうへ座ったの……やがてモゾモゾ体を動かし始め、あたしの手をそっと握ったり、ギュッと握ったり……とてもゴツい指だったわ」
「へえ、知らなかったよ。なぜ、僕に言わなかったんだ」
「だって、あなたはきっと、大きな声で怒鳴るでしょう……困るわ」

## Literal English Translation

One rainy day—Mitsuko went to the bath in the early afternoon. Her fresh-from-the-bath skin was so soft it seemed fragile enough to be damaged even by raindrops.
"Today is a service," her fingers, even more supple with sweat, entwined with mine once again.
"What do you mean by service?"
"Playing lovers... hey, it's okay, right? It's our first day off in a long time."
And so, the two of us shared a single umbrella, holding each other close, and went to the nearby toilet-stinking movie theater.

However, on the way back through the pouring rain at dusk, "I was scared," Mitsuko whispered, hunching her shoulders.
"What happened?"
"Inside the movie theater..."
"We played lovers, didn't we?"
"Yes... but, you were only fiddling with my left hand, right? At that time, did you not notice anything?"
"No, because I was only distracted by your body and the movie."
"I was, from time to time, on the side opposite you... pulled forcefully to the right..."
"What happened, exactly? Was there a pervert or something?"

"It was the Gorilla... it was our Lord Gorilla..."
"Eh? Gorilla... do you mean our Boss? Was that guy there too?"
"Yes. He quietly went home before it got bright."
"What did that [guy] do?"
"....It's scary. Even to speak of it. Will you get angry?"
"That's why [I'm asking], what on earth happened?"
"When we entered, the screen was just dark, so without knowing what kind of person was next to us, we lined up in the empty seats, right?"
"Yeah, right and left were pitch black."

"Then, shortly after, someone fat sat down partway through on my right side... eventually he started moving his body restlessly, and softly squeezed my hand, then squeezed it tight... they were very rugged fingers."
"Heeh, I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me?"
"Because, surely you would have shouted in a loud voice... that would be trouble."
"Trouble, you say... that's strange... isn't that strange?"

"Because, I realized it was the Boss. Thanks to that, my hand ended up messy with sweat. On top of that, the Boss, he kept pulling my hand forcefully toward his own body... while even ear-rubbing [whispering], 'Ma'am, keep this a secret from the husband'..."
"So, what happened? Were you touched?"
"Because, it was such strong force, I... my fingers felt like they would be torn off... The Boss's body, truly like a gorilla, was hot, and it was intense..."

**Secret Affairs Behind the Sliding Door**

I felt like I was going to go mad. My breathing just became violent, and my chest felt like it was blocked.
That night, as usual, I had Mitsuko's soft lower body constricted tightly in a pine-needle shape with my legs, but not even a little gentle desire welled up. Rather, my chest just burned with a dark, singular emotion.
Damn it! Even if I grind my teeth, the opponent is the landlord and a sturdy workman. Nothing can be done.
My whole body starts trembling. Suddenly, the tips of my fingers touching Mitsuko's skin felt as if they were placed in a hot swamp.
My cute doll had been, beforehand, and without any...

One rainy day, Mitsuko went to the public bath in the early afternoon. Fresh from the water, her skin was so soft it seemed as though even the raindrops might bruise it.
"Today, you get a treat," she said, her fingers—supple with sweat—entwining once again with mine.
"A treat? What kind?"
"We’re going to play lovers... Come on, why not? It’s our first day off in ages."
And so, sharing our single umbrella, we clung to each other and headed for the nearby movie theater that reeked of the latrine.

However, on our way back through the dusk and driving rain, Mitsuko hunched her shoulders and whispered, "It was scary."
"What was?"
"In the theater..."
"We were playing lovers, weren't we?"
"Yes... but you were only playing with my left hand, weren't you? Didn't you notice anything happening?"
"No. I was too distracted by your body and the film."
"I... every now and then, on the side away from you... I was being pulled hard to the right..."
"What on earth happened? Was there a molester?"

"It was the Gorilla... *Our* Lord Gorilla."
"Eh? The Gorilla... you mean our Boss? That guy was there?"
"Yes. He slipped away quietly before the lights came up."
"What did he do?"
"It scares me... even to say it. Will you get angry?"
"Just tell me, what the hell happened?"
"When we went in, the screen was dark, so we sat in the empty seats without knowing who was next to us, right?"
"Yeah, it was pitch black on both sides."

"Well, shortly after, some fat man sat down partway through on my right... eventually he started shifting around restlessly. He squeezed my hand softly, then hard... they were very rough, rugged fingers."
"Huh, I had no idea. Why didn't you tell me?"
"Because you would have shouted in a loud voice, for sure... and that would be trouble."
"'Trouble,' you say... that's odd... isn't that a strange thing to say?"

"But I realized it was the Boss. Thanks to him, my hand got all sticky and messy with sweat. And then the Boss kept pulling my hand harder and harder toward his own body... even whispering in my ear, 'Missus, keep this a secret from the hubby'..."
"So, what happened? Did he touch you?"
"The force was so strong, I... I thought my fingers would be ripped off... The Boss's body, it was truly like a gorilla—so hot, and so intense..."

**Secret Affairs Behind the Sliding Door**

I felt like I was going insane. My breath came in ragged gasps; my chest felt crushed.
That night, as always, I pinned Mitsuko’s soft lower body tight between my legs in the "pine-needle" position, yet not a shred of tender desire welled up within me. Instead, my chest burned only with a dark, peculiar emotion.
*Damn it!* I ground my teeth, but my opponent was our landlord, a burly workman. I was helpless.
My entire body began to tremble. Suddenly, my fingertips upon Mitsuko's skin felt as though they had been plunged into a hot swamp.
My cute little doll had been—beforehand, and without any warning—defiled.

### 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

```markdown
## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Format:** Serialized erotic fiction or a "True Story" (jitsura) column typical of *Kitan Club*.
*   **Genre:** *Kiseki* (Strange True Stories) / Ero-Guro / Noir.
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person male ("Boku"). The perspective is deeply psychological, focusing on male inadequacy and sexual jealousy.
*   **Sectioning:**
    *   The dialogue dominates the upper 2/3rds of the page, establishing the incident.
    *   The bold header **襖の向うで秘事が** (Secret Affairs Behind the Sliding Door) acts as a scene break, shifting from the dialogue about the past event to the narrator's immediate, tormented reaction during sex later that night.
*   **Target Audience:** Adult men in the Showa era, appealing to voyeuristic fantasies and anxieties about class/virility (the intellectual narrator vs. the physical laborer).
```

### 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

```markdown
## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **"Benjo-kusai Eigakan" (Toilet-stinking movie theater):** A quintessential marker of the early-to-mid Showa era (1950s). Small, neighborhood theaters often had poor ventilation and sanitation. They were dark, crowded spaces known for cruising and "chikan" (groping), creating a specific atmosphere of illicit sexuality.
*   **"Oyakata" (Boss/Master) & "Yanushi" (Landlord):** The antagonist is a figure of authority and physical labor. In the postwar housing shortage, the landlord held immense power over tenants. The term "Gorilla" emphasizes his primitive, brutish vitality compared to the narrator.
*   **"Okusan" (Ma'am/Missus):** The Boss calls Mitsuko "Okusan," implying the narrator and Mitsuko are married or cohabitating as a common-law couple.
*   **Class Dynamics:** The narrator appears weaker, perhaps intellectual or white-collar (afraid to make a scene), while the "Gorilla" is a "sturdy workman" (takumashii shigotoshi). The text fetishizes the "hot," "rugged" virility of the working-class aggressor.
```

---

### 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes

```markdown
## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Matsuba-gata (松葉形):** Literally "Pine-needle shape." An erotic literary term describing a position where the woman's legs are spread wide (resembling a split pine needle) or wrapped tightly around the male.
*   **Koibito-gokko (恋人ごっこ):** "Playing lovers." Suggests a roleplay element to their relationship, or perhaps they are an established couple trying to recapture a spark/dating vibe.
*   **Kucha-kucha (クチャクチャ):** Onomatopoeia for a wet, messy, sticky sound or sensation. Here used to describe the sweat on the hand, invoking a visceral, tactile disgust.
*   **Mimi-kosuri (耳こすり):** Literally "ear-rubbing." A slang/dialect term for whispering, implying intimacy and physical proximity.
```

---

### 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

```markdown
## Themes & Subtext

*   **NTR (Cuckolding) & Masculine Anxiety:** The core theme is the narrator's realization that his partner was sexually engaged (unwillingly or ambiguously) by a superior male (the "Gorilla") right next to him.
*   **Impotence vs. Virility:** The narrator is physically present but oblivious ("distracted by the movie"), while the Boss exerts "strong force" and heat. The narrator's subsequent sex with Mitsuko is devoid of "gentle desire," replaced by a "dark, peculiar emotion" (likely a mix of arousal and rage).
*   **Ambiguity of Consent:** Mitsuko describes the event as "scary," yet the narrator suspects her because she didn't call out. Her description of the Boss's body ("hot," "intense") hints at a complex reaction beyond simple revulsion, fueling the narrator's paranoia.
*   **The "Doll" Trope:** The narrator refers to Mitsuko as "my cute doll" (kawaii boku no ningyo), objectifying her. His despair comes from his "property" being "soiled" (yogosareteita) by another man.
