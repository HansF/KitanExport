一、眼玉の飛び出た男

湯舟にこつぽり頸までつかり、雜布（ざふきん）のような手拭で顔をこすりながら、古田留吉は、寺田菊三の巧みなお喋りを「へえー、なるほど」と感心して聞いている。
「飲み屋ぐれえするなあボロクソだ。おいつ、頼むぜ、はいよお、てなことで、あつしの顔をもつてゆきやあ、指物屋の源助なんざあチョンチョコチョンの仲良しだから屋台店のひとつぐらいい今うて明日髓えてくれるし、看板ときちゃ学者の米吉に書かせる、奴は靴磨きだが字はうめえんだぜ」

黙つているのと凝としているのが死ぬより嫌いで、年中自転車で飛び廻つている寺田菊三は、筋肉質のもりくした躰でしやんと立上り、頭のてっぺんから、ざあざあと五六杯も湯をかむり、ぶるんくーと顔を振つて早やどぶんと湯舟につかり、熱いものだから、いつものくせで、食いしばつた歯のすきまから、シィーシィーと息を吐いている。

いつものくせで、食いしばつた歯のすきまから、シィーシィーと息を吐いている。
留吉は、頬の垂れ下つた貧乏くさい佛面（ほとけづら）を振つて
「あつしも、何か、いい儲け口を探してるんですが、どうも――」
と、歯切れの悪い声でそういいながら栄養失調のむくんだ躰を、湯舟につけ、湯気のこもつている天井を見上げながら、厚い唇の両端を掌でこすつている。

一年ほどまえ、菊三が、一番風呂にドブンと飛びこんだとき、悠々と天井裏を眺めながら、掌で、いまのように唇の両端をこすつていた留吉の佛顔に飛沫（しぶき）をかけたことがあつた。
が、留吉は、いつこうに驚いた様子もなく、蛙に水をぶつかけたように、力のない細い眼をパチパチとやったきり微動だにしない。
こりゃてつきり、大きな会社の重役か、それとも役人だつたら部長級の人間に違いないと思つた菊三は
「ひや――、こりゃ、どうも、つい、薄暗くて、いやはや、かんべんなすつて――」
と、ぺこく頭を下げた。
「いや」
留吉は、相変らず、掌で唇を撫でたりつまんだりしている。
それから菊三は、持ち前の気のよさと軽口で、腹の底まで断ち割つた話をベラ――とまくしたてた。
「なんてたって今の時代はブロカーが一番でさあ、右の物を左へやるだけで元手はいらねえ、税金はかからねえ――いや――」
しまつた、この男、税務署長ぢやあねえかな？と菊三は、キョロくーとよく動く眼玉を剥いてチラッと留吉の顔を窺つたが
「ブ、ブロカー？て、なんでござんす」留吉は、そんなにいい商賣（あきない）の名前を知らなくちやあと思い聞いてみた。
で、菊三は、ホッと肩の荷をおろし得意になつて、包み紙の新聞で覚えたむづかしい單語をちょっぴり混ぜて説明

一、目玉の飛び出た男

湯船にこっぽり首までつかり、雑巾のような手拭いで顔をこすりながら、古田留吉は、寺田菊三の巧みな喋りを「へえー、なるほど」と感心して聞いている。
「飲み屋ぐらい開くのは簡単だ。おい、頼むぜ、はいよ、てなことで、あっしの顔を持っていけば、指物屋の源助なんかはちょんちょこちょんの仲良しだから、屋台店の一つぐらい今日言って明日据えてくれるし、看板となれば学者の米吉に書かせる。奴は靴磨きだが字は上手いんだぜ」

黙っているのとじっとしているのが死ぬより嫌いで、年中自転車で飛び回っている寺田菊三は、筋肉質のもりもりした体でしゃんと立ち上がり、頭のてっぺんから、ざあざあと五六杯も湯を被り、ぶるんっと顔を振って、早くもどぶんと湯船に浸かり、熱いものだから、いつもの癖で、食いしばった歯の隙間から、シーシーと息を吐いている。

留吉は、頬の垂れ下がった貧乏くさい仏面（ほとけづら）を振って
「あっしも、何か、いい儲け口を探してるんですが、どうも……」
と、歯切れの悪い声でそう言いながら栄養失調のむくんだ体を、湯船につけ、湯気のこもっている天井を見上げながら、厚い唇の両端を掌でこすっている。

一年ほど前、菊三が一番風呂にドブンと飛び込んだとき、悠々と天井裏を眺めながら、掌で、今のように唇の両端をこすっていた留吉の仏顔に飛沫（しぶき）をかけたことがあった。

Badger Game (Tsutsugaise) Opening
Modern Lustful Monster Tales

**Text:**
1. The Man Whose Eyeballs Popped Out

Soaking in the bathtub up to his neck, while rubbing his face with a hand-towel like a dustcloth, Furuta Tomekichi is listening with admiration to Terada Kikuzo's skillful chatter, saying "Heh, I see."
"Starting a bar or such is trash-easy. 'Hey, I'm asking you,' 'Sure thing,' with that kind of thing, if you take my face (influence) there, Gensuke the cabinetmaker and I are 'chon-choko-chon' (very close) friends, so he'd set up one stall or so if I ask today by tomorrow, and as for the sign, I'll have the scholar Yonekichi write it; that guy is a shoe-shiner but his characters are good."

Hating being silent or staying still more than death, Terada Kikuzo, who flies around on a bicycle all year round, stood up straight with his muscular, bulging body, poured five or six scoops of hot water over the top of his head with a splash, shook his face with a 'burun' sound, and quickly plunged 'dobun' into the bathtub; because it was hot, by habit, he was breathing 'shii-shii' through the gaps of his clenched teeth.

Tomekichi, shaking his poverty-stricken, sagging-cheeked Buddha-face (expressionless face),
"I, too, am looking for some good way to make money, but somehow..."
While saying so in a voice lacking clarity, he dipped his body, swollen from malnutrition, into the tub, and while looking up at the steam-filled ceiling, rubbed both ends of his thick lips with his palms.

About one year ago, when Kikuzo jumped 'dobun' into the first bath of the day, he had splashed water on the Buddha-face of Tomekichi, who was leisurely looking at the ceiling and rubbing the ends of his lips with his palms just as he was now.
But Tomekichi showed no sign of being surprised at all, just like splashing water on a frog's face, he only blinked his weak, thin eyes and did not move a muscle.
Thinking, "This person must surely be a director of a large company, or if an official, at least a department-head class," Kikuzo,
"Hya—, this, well, it was just dim, oh dear, please forgive me—"
And bowed his head 'peko'.
"No."
Tomekichi, as usual, was stroking or pinching his lips with his palm.
After that, Kikuzo, with his natural good nature and talkativeness, rattled off a story from the bottom of his heart 'bera-'.
"Anyway, in these times, being a broker is the best. Just moving things from the right to the left requires no capital, no taxes—wait—"
"Oops, isn't this man a Tax Office Chief?" Kikuzo thought, and peeling back his 'kyoro-' moving eyeballs, he stole a glance at Tomekichi's face.
"B-broker? What is that?" Tomekichi, thinking he must learn the name of such a good business, tried asking.
Then Kikuzo, feeling relieved of a burden from his shoulders, became proud and explained, mixing in a few difficult words he had learned from the newspaper wrapping paper.

**Title:**
Launch of the Honey Trap: Tales of Modern Erotic Monsters
By Yoshio Takeoki
Illustrated by Kenji

**The Story:**
I. The Man with the Popping Eyes

Submerged up to his neck in the bath, Furuta Tomekichi scrubbed his face with a towel as coarse as a floor rag, listening with rapt attention to Terada Kikuzo’s smooth talk. 
“Opening a dive bar is a piece of cake,” Kikuzo boasted. “Just a quick word from me and it’s done. If you use my name, Gensuke the cabinetmaker—we’re tight as thieves—he’ll have a stall ready for you by tomorrow if I ask today. As for the signage, I’ll get ‘Scholar’ Yonekichi to do it. He’s a shoe-shiner, sure, but the man’s got a hand like a calligrapher.”

Kikuzo, a man who loathed silence and stillness more than death and spent his days racing around on a bicycle, stood up, his muscular frame glistening. He dumped several ladles of hot water over his head, gave his face a vigorous shake, and plunged back into the tub with a splash. The water was scalding; he hissed through his teeth as he settled in.

Tomekichi, whose sagging cheeks gave him the mournful, expressionless look of a stone Buddha, let out a sigh. 
“I’ve been looking for a way to make a buck myself,” he muttered in a flat, dull voice, “but I haven't had much luck.” He lowered his malnourished, bloated body into the water, staring up at the ceiling through the steam while rubbing the corners of his thick lips with his palms.

About a year ago, Kikuzo had accidentally splashed Tomekichi while diving into the fresh bath. Back then, Tomekichi had been doing exactly what he was doing now—staring at the rafters and rubbing his lips. He hadn't even flinched; it was like water off a frog’s back. He just blinked his weak eyes, motionless.
Kikuzo, certain he had offended some high-ranking corporate executive or a senior government official, had bowed frantically. “Oh, my apologies! It was so dark, I didn't see you there. Please, forgive me!”
“It’s fine,” Tomekichi had said simply, continuing to fiddle with his lips.
Encouraged by the man’s stoicism, Kikuzo had launched into one of his characteristic long-winded rants. “Listen, these days, being a ‘broker’ is where the real money is. You just move goods from one hand to the other—no overhead, no taxes… wait…”
Kikuzo suddenly froze. *Damn, what if this guy is the Chief of the Tax Office?* He rolled his eyes nervously, stealing a glance at Tomekichi.
“A… ‘broker’? What on earth is that?” Tomekichi asked, genuinely curious about this supposedly lucrative profession.
Relieved that he hadn't just confessed to a tax man, Kikuzo relaxed. He began to explain with newfound confidence, peppering his speech with impressive-sounding jargon he’d picked up from the scraps of newspaper used to wrap his lunches.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows a standard vertical right-to-left reading flow common in Japanese periodicals. The text is wrapped around a central illustration, creating a dynamic visual hierarchy.
*   **Typography:** The title uses large, bold, hand-drawn lettering (kantei-ryū influence but modernized) to grab attention. The subtitle is smaller and stylized. Small furigana (reading aids) are provided for difficult kanji like 美人局 (tsutsugaise).
*   **Illustration:** The central image features a man in a traditional wooden bathtub (furo). The art style is characteristic of the "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense) movement, showing a mix of everyday life with slightly exaggerated or voyeuristic undertones. The lines are loose and expressive.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is divided into sections that navigate around the artwork, a common technique in pulp magazines to maintain reader interest across the page.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-war Japan, late 1940s-1950s):** The text contains several markers of the immediate post-war period. References to "malnutrition" (栄養失調), "shoe-shiners" (靴磨き), and "brokers" (ブロカー) point to the chaotic economic environment of the black market (yami-ichi) era.
*   **Sento (Public Bath) Culture:** In this period, most people did not have baths at home. The *sento* was a vital social hub where people of different classes mixed naked, which serves as the setting for the comedic misunderstanding between the protagonist and the "Buddha-faced" man.
*   **The Term "Broker":** In the post-war ruins, "brokers" were middlemen who facilitated the trade of scarce goods. While often associated with the black market and illegal activities, they were seen as figures of envy for their ability to make money without manual labor.
*   **Tsutsugaise (美人局):** This term refers to a "badger game" or a honey trap where a couple conspires to extort money from a victim by catching him in a compromising position with the woman. The title suggests the story will evolve into the formation of such a criminal enterprise.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **美人局 (Tsutsugaise):** An unusual kanji compound. It literally means "Beautiful Woman Bureau" but is read "Tsutsugaise." It refers to a specific type of extortion scam.
*   **佛面 (Butsumen / Hotoke-zura):** "Buddha face." Refers to an expressionless, stoic, or perhaps slightly somber face. 
*   **チョンチョコチョン (Chon-choko-chon):** A slang/onomatopoeic expression indicating being very close or on very good terms with someone.
*   **あつし (Atashi/Asshi):** A dialectal or low-class masculine variation of "watashi" (I), typical of the "Edokko" or downtown Tokyo working class.
*   **ボロクソ (Borokuso):** Literally "rag-shit." Slang for something that is easy, worthless, or handled roughly.
*   **指物屋 (Sashimonoya):** A traditional cabinetmaker or joiner.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Social Misunderstanding:** A core theme is the humor derived from Kikuzo mistaking a poor, malnourished man for a powerful official simply because the man is quiet and stoic.
*   **Survival and Grifting:** The story explores the desperate yet opportunistic mindset of the post-war urban poor. The characters are looking for "good ways to make money" (儲け口) and are willing to engage in scams (the badger game) to survive.
*   **The Power of Language:** Kikuzo uses "difficult words" learned from newspapers to sound more knowledgeable than he is, highlighting the gap between the educated class and the street-smart survivors of the era.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Humor, Pulp Fiction (Kasutori).
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Poverty, Scams, Social Class, Sento (Public Bath), Black Market.
*   **Tone:** Comedic, slightly cynical, colloquial.
