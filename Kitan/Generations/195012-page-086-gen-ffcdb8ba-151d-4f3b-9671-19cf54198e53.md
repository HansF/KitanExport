## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

「かつて忠告した。……」
「大丈夫です。」
「ハハ、余り大丈夫そうな顔でもないな。首が飛ぶぞ、首が……」
（殺される事許り源内殿は云うが、独り者の俺にとって、死ぬ事はさして恐ろしい事でもない。一層思い切って……）
　金平は好奇心に負けたのだった。源内の戒めを破つてあの夜、秘かに監視の眼を潜つて屋敷の庭内に忍び込んだ。植込の蔭からソツと首を出すと、部屋々の切髪姿、無常を感じたうなだれた姿が、ゆらゆらと障子に影を落して、さも孤影慽然と見えた。黒くお長屋がずつと続いていた。足音を愉んでお長屋からお長屋へ、長い軒下を蝙蝠の様に雨の闇を縫うて、猟奇に憑かれて歩き廻つた。
　サラゝゝ……。水を流す音が何処からともなく聞える。ハッとした金平は本能的に地べたに身を伏せて音の方を探つた。それはお長屋の外れの廊下らしかった。細々と妙に陰気に水の音はきこえる。静かに身を起して、その辺りを目覚し処を捜つと猫の様に眼を光らせて打見守つた。
（我乍ら大胆な事だ。日頃の俺にも似合わぬ所業。忍んだところで誰と言う目当もない。又してもつまらん事をしたものだな……）
　金平は些か懸（は）ずみが悔まれた。夜風が鼻腔を通りぬけた拍子にハツとしたが追いつかない。懸命にこらえ様とするのに反撥するが如く、大きな落しやみが静寂を破った。
「誰ですか？」
　凛として然も女性的な甘い柔かい声が飛んで来た。仕方がない、度胸を据えて金平はぬつと立上つて声に向つて現われた。
「御用口監視役、小幡金平と云うものです。」
　女は驚いた様に凝つと見つめていたが、急に慌ただしく無言で手招いた。
（さあ、愈々蛇に見込まれて招かれたぞ。よしこうなれば度胸を据えろ。捨てゝ惜しくない命。将軍と義兄弟なら死んでも本望——）
　金平はこの年まで童貞であった。で、そう思い乍らも心とは反対に動作は蔭張り消極的で、いつ迄ももし／＼していた。
「早く……」
　しびれを切らして女は声に出して呼んだ。今更逃げ帰りも出来ぬ。臆する心に鞭打つてつか／＼進むと、その儘云われる儘に二階に上りこんだ。女は後架に行つての帰り、手を浄めていた処だつたのだ。
　明るい処で見た女は、はちきれん許りの若さを体一杯に漲らして、切髪もそぐはな三日月眉の、窈窕たる美女だつた。
　女は中臈の切島であると自ら名乗つて、名はお柳と云つた。
「どうして又この夜更けに？……」
　お柳が問うのに、金平はグツとつまつた。
「ハツ、その道に迷つて……」と苦しい答弁。
「ホホホ、監視役がこの屋敷で道に迷つたとのうしたか。これも何かの縁。なう、金平殿とやら、わたしを逃がしてもらえぬか。」
「えッ！」
　驚くのも無理はない。
　と、ぐつと膝をすり寄せて、そつと白魚のしなやかな指を金平の膝にのせた。ガタゝゝ——金平の膝がのめ。にっこり笑つた眼元の艶なこと。金平は一眼で惚れた。こんな女を女房と迄はいかなくとも、せめて一度逢瀬を楽しみ得たなら、もう命も要らぬと考えた。唇が雪路の唇によく似ている。そう云えば、眼も、いや顔立ちも……。
「わたしの切ない、苦しい胸の内をきいて下さい金平殿。」
「——い、いや。もうよく判つています。分りすぎる程よく分ります。兎も角今日は片付かぬ。いづれ出直す。じわ／＼金縛りになりそうな肉体をやつと支えて金平はかすれ声で云つた。
「——きつと、きつと来て下さいませ……」
「——ハア、必らず……」
　そして別れて、金平は源内に初島の御清様なる事をきいたのである。フーム益々惚れた。
（すると、お柳様は未だ生娘。
　何のかならぬものか——）
　もう、金平の頭はお柳様の事でギツシリつまって一寸動いてもおりゆろ／＼ときしむ様に思えた。

四
　トン……、微かに雨戸を叩くと、待ち兼ねた様にスルリと開いて、暗闇にポツカリと初島のお柳様の顔が白く浮いた。素早く手をとつて雨戸をしめる。
　金平はこれで三度、きわどい芸当をして、戀のアヴァンチュールにくゞりぬけた。
「——俺達は御用口から御中臈を監視している。その俺達を伊賀者が外から監視していることを忘れるなと云う源内の言葉も上の空、金平は一途にお柳に魅入られていた。
　下総葛連川がお柳の生れ故郷、十五の年に大奥に仕え、十八の時に見染められて中臈になつて、御召しの夜、私の体の清い儘で上様は私を抱いて亡くなられたと、お柳は恥かしげに頬を染めて語つた。両親はいないが自由の身になりたい。例え途中で殺されても、
「——金平様、貴方と御一緒なら私嬉しい……」
　と、身をくねらせて悶えた。
　金平は誰も怖いと思わなかつた。身を灼く恋に、心はまつしぐらにお柳に走つているのであつた。首尾よく此丘屋敷を連れ出して、下総に走つた後はどうする？。それから後は未だ考えなかつたが、今よりも、もつともつと楽しい天地が開けそうに思える。眉毛落して鉄漿（かね）つけて、毎夜／＼誰に気兼なしに、お柳〜！と彼女が抱ける。金平はもうその想像だけで胸の疼く思いだつた。
「——お柳様。逃げ延びて、楽しく生きられるだけ生

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Once [I] warned. ..."
"I am okay."
"Haha, not a very okay-looking face, it is. Your head will fly off, your head will..."
(Killing things only Gennai-dono says, but for a single person [like] me, to die is not that scary a thing. Rather, [I should] go for it...)
Kinpei lost to curiosity. Breaking Gennai's warning that night, secretly slipping past the surveillance eyes, he sneaked into the garden of the mansion. When he softly poked his head from the shadow of the bushes, the "cut-hair" (shorn) figures of the various rooms, figures looking down having felt impermanence, cast swaying shadows on the paper doors, and appeared truly "lonely-shadow-sorrowful." Blackly, the longhouse row continued on. Enjoying [the sound of] footsteps from longhouse to longhouse, through the long under-eaves like a bat sewing through the rain's darkness, possessed by the "bizarre-seeking" (ryoki), he walked around.
Sara-sara... The sound of flowing water is heard from nowhere. Startled Kinpei instinctively flattened his body to the ground and searched toward the sound. It seemed to be a corridor at the edge of the longhouse. Faintly and strangely gloomily, the sound of water is heard. Quietly raising his body, searching the area for a likely spot, he kept watch with eyes glowing like a cat.
(Even for me, a bold thing. A deed not suiting my usual self. Even sneaking in, there is no particular target. Again, I have done a pointless thing...)
Kinpei regretted the momentum somewhat. At the moment the night wind passed through his nostrils, he was startled but could not catch [it]. As if reacting against his desperate effort to endure it, a large sneeze broke the silence.
"Who is it?"
A dignified yet feminine, sweet, soft voice flew over. It cannot be helped; setting his courage, Kinpei stood up "nuttu" (suddenly/boldly) and appeared toward the voice.
"Surveillance officer of the official entrance, a person called Obata Kinpei."
The woman stared fixedly as if surprised, but suddenly, busily, without words, she beckoned.
(Now, finally, I am spotted by the snake and beckoned. Well, if it comes to this, set your courage. A life not regrettable to throw away. If I am sworn brothers with the Shogun, to die is my desire—)
Kinpei had been a virgin until this year. So, while thinking that, contrary to his heart, his movements were shadow-clinging and passive, and he was "moshi-moshi" (hesitating) forever.
"Quickly..."
Losing patience, the woman called out with her voice. Now he cannot even flee back. Whipping his cowardly heart, he advanced "tsuka-tsuka" (briskly), and just as he was told, went up to the second floor. It was where the woman, returning from the "rear rack" (toilet), was purifying her hands.
The woman seen in the light was a "loveliness-surpassing" beauty with crescent-moon eyebrows that did not suit her cut-hair, with youthful energy overflowing in her whole body.
The woman introduced herself as "Churo" (middle-rank lady-in-waiting) Kirishima, and said her name was Onyagi.
"Why again at this late hour?..."
To Onyagi's question, Kinpei was "guttu" (stuck/speechless).
"Ha, that... I got lost..." was his painful defense.
"Ho-ho-ho, does a surveillance officer say he got lost in this mansion? This too is some kind of fate. Now, Kinpei-dono or whatever, could you not let me escape?"
"Eh!"
It is no wonder he was surprised.
And then, sliding her knees "guttu" (closely), she softly placed "ice-fish" (white/slender) supple fingers on Kinpei's knee. Gata-gata—Kinpei's knees shook. The sexiness of her smiling eyes. Kinpei fell in love at first sight. Even if such a woman did not become his wife, if he could just enjoy a secret meeting once, he thought he would no longer need his life. Her lips resemble Yukiji's lips closely. Speaking of which, her eyes, no, her facial features too...
"Please listen to my painful, suffering inner heart, Kinpei-dono."
"—N-no. I already understand well. I understand so much it's too much. Anyway, today it won't be settled. I will come again later."
Finally supporting his body which felt like it was becoming "money-bound" (paralyzed) bit by bit, Kinpei said in a raspy voice:
"—Surely, surely please come..."
"—Hah, certainly..."
And parting, Kinpei heard from Gennai that she was the "Lady Okiyo" of Hatsushima. Hmmm, he fell for her more and more.
(Then, Lady Onyagi is still a raw-maiden (virgin).
Can something not be done—)
Already, Kinpei's head was packed full with Lady Onyagi's things, and he thought that even with a slight movement, it creaked "oriyuro-yuro."

4
Ton... When he faintly tapped the rain shutter, it opened "sururi" (smoothly) as if she had been waiting, and in the darkness, Lady Onyagi's face of Hatsushima floated up white. Quickly taking her hand, he closed the rain shutter.
Kinpei, with this being the third time, performing a risky feat, slipped through a love "aventure" (adventure).
"We are monitoring the Churo from the official entrance. Do not forget that Iga-men (ninjas) are monitoring us from the outside," Gennai's words were also "upper-sky" (ignored), Kinpei was single-mindedly enchanted by Onyagi.
Katsuragawa in Shimousa was Onyagi's birthplace; at age fifteen she served in the O-oku, at eighteen she was spotted and became a Churo, and on the night of the "summoning," with her body still pure, the Lord died while holding her—so Onyagi told, dyeing her cheeks with shame. She has no parents but wants to be free. Even if she is killed on the way,
"—Kinpei-sama, if I am with you, I am happy..."
So saying, she twisted her body and writhed.
Kinpei did not think anyone was scary. In the body-searing love, his heart was running headlong toward Onyagi. After successfully taking her out of this mansion and running to Shimousa, what then? He had not thought about what comes after that yet, but it seemed a world much more fun than now would open. Dropping eyebrows and putting on "kane" (tooth black), every night without worrying about anyone, "Onyagi!"—he could hold her. Kinpei's heart ached just with that imagination.
"—Lady Onyagi. Escape and live, live as long as we can happily..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"I warned you once before..."
"I’ll be fine."
"Ha! You don't exactly look fine. Your head's going to roll, boy, mark my words..."
(Master Gennai only ever talks of being killed, but for a bachelor like me, death isn't such a terrifying prospect. I’d rather take the plunge and...)

Kinpei had lost the battle to his own curiosity. Disregarding Gennai’s admonition, he had crept past the sentries under the cover of night to slip into the mansion’s inner gardens. Peering cautiously from the shadows of the shrubbery, he saw the silhouettes of women with shorn hair—those who had renounced the world—their heads bowed in an air of profound mourning. Their shadows flickered against the paper *shoji* doors, appearing utterly desolate. A row of dark tenement-style outbuildings stretched into the distance. Savouring the sound of his own muffled footsteps, he flitted from one building to the next beneath the long eaves, weaving through the rainy dark like a bat, possessed by a morbid fascination.

*Sera-sera...* The sound of running water drifted from nowhere. Jolted, Kinpei instinctively pressed himself to the earth, scanning for the source. It seemed to come from a corridor at the edge of the outbuildings—a faint, strangely eerie trickle. Rising silently, he prowled the area, his eyes gleaming in the dark like a cat’s.

(I’m bolder than I thought. This isn't like me at all. I’ve sneaked in here with no particular target in mind. Once again, I’ve gone and done something foolish...)
Kinpei felt a pang of regret for his impulsiveness. He felt a tickle in his nose as the night breeze whistled through, and though he tried desperately to suppress it, a thunderous sneeze shattered the silence.

"Who’s there?"
A voice rang out—dignified, yet feminine and sweet. There was no turning back now. Steeling himself, Kinpei rose from the shadows and stepped toward the voice.
"Obata Kinpei, guard of the official entrance."
The woman stared at him, wide-eyed with shock, before suddenly and silently beckoning him over with an urgent wave.
(Well, the snake has found its prey. If it’s come to this, I’d better be brave. My life isn't worth much anyway. If the Shogun were my brother, I’d be happy to die—)
Kinpei was a virgin, despite his age. Consequently, despite his bold thoughts, his movements were tentative and shy; he hovered in the shadows, hesitating.

"Hurry..." the woman called out, her patience wearing thin.
There was no escaping now. Steeling his nerves, he marched forward and followed her up to the second floor. She had evidently been purifying her hands after returning from the washroom.
In the light, she was a breathtaking beauty, her youthful vitality practically radiating from her. Despite her shorn hair, her elegant crescent-moon eyebrows remained, framing a face of exquisite grace.
She introduced herself as Kirishima, a middle-rank lady-in-waiting, though her personal name was Onyagi.

"What brings you here at such a late hour?" she asked.
Kinpei was at a total loss for words.
"I... I lost my way," he stammered, a pathetic excuse.
"Ho-ho! A guard, lost in this very mansion? Perhaps it is fate. Tell me, Kinpei-dono, would you help me escape this place?"
"What!?"
His shock was understandable.
She slid toward him, pressing her knee against his, and gently rested her slender, pale fingers upon him. Kinpei’s knees began to knock together. The allure in her smiling eyes was intoxicating; he fell for her instantly. He decided then and there that even if she never became his wife, he would gladly trade his life for a single night of passion with her. Her lips reminded him of Yukiji’s... and her eyes, even her silhouette...

"Please, Kinpei-dono, listen to the sorrow in my heart."
"I... I understand. I understand all too well. But we can't settle this tonight. I’ll come back."
Barely able to move his limbs, which felt as though they were bound by invisible cords, Kinpei managed to rasp out the words.
"Promise me... promise me you’ll come back..."
"I will. I promise."

Later, Kinpei learned from Gennai that she was the Lady Okiyo of Hatsushima. He was more infatuated than ever.
(So, Lady Onyagi is still a maiden... Is there no way to make her mine?)
His head was so full of thoughts of her that it felt as though his very skull creaked with the weight of them.

4
*Tap...* He knocked softly on the rain shutter. It slid open instantly, and Lady Onyagi’s pale face emerged from the darkness like a ghost. He took her hand and slipped inside, quickly closing the shutter behind him.
This was Kinpei’s third such reckless feat, a dangerous dance of romantic adventure.
"We're watching the ladies-in-waiting, but don't forget the Iga ninjas are watching us," Gennai had warned him, but the words meant nothing. Kinpei was utterly bewitched.
Onyagi spoke of her home by the Katsuragawa River in Shimousa. She had entered the O-oku at fifteen, and at eighteen, she had been chosen by the Shogun. But on the very night she was summoned to his chambers, the Lord had passed away in her arms before the act was consummated. She told him this with a blush of shame. She was orphaned and longed for her freedom. Even if she were killed in the attempt...
"Kinpei-sama, if I am with you, I shall be happy," she whispered, her body trembling with emotion.

Kinpei feared nothing now. His heart was consumed by a burning passion for her. He hadn't thought about what they would do once he smuggled her out of the mansion and fled to Shimousa. He only knew that a brighter, happier world awaited them. He imagined her with the shaved eyebrows and blackened teeth of a married woman, calling her name—"Onyagi!"—as he held her every night without a care in the world. The mere thought made his heart ache with longing.
"Lady Onyagi. Let us escape and live together, for as long as we can..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** This is a classic example of Japanese vertical typesetting (*tate-gaki*). The text is arranged in columns that read from top to bottom, right to left. 
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style, typical of the mid-20th century. Furigana (small phonetic characters) are used strategically—not for every kanji, but for difficult vocabulary (like 慽然 *sekizen*), specific names (like 葛連川 *Katsuragawa*), or to provide a specific reading for a word (like 鉄漿 *kane*).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text uses indentation for new paragraphs and parentheses for internal monologues, a common convention in Japanese fiction to distinguish thought from narrative and dialogue.
*   **Section Markers:** The presence of the numeral "四" (4) at the bottom indicates that this is the fourth chapter or section of a serialized story.
*   **Pulp Aesthetic:** The use of "..." (ellipses) and dramatic exclamations ("Eh!", "Ho-ho-ho!") suggests a popular fiction or "pulp" style, designed for quick, engaging reading.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Setting (Edo Period):** The story is set in the Edo period, specifically involving the *O-oku* (the inner palace of the Shogun where women resided). 
*   **Hiraga Gennai:** The "Gennai" mentioned is almost certainly **Hiraga Gennai** (1728–1780), a famous historical polymath, inventor, and writer. In fiction, Gennai is often portrayed as a brilliant, eccentric mastermind or detective figure.
*   **Social Conventions:** 
    *   **Churo (中臈):** A mid-to-high rank lady-in-waiting in the Shogun's palace.
    *   **Kirigami (切髪):** A hairstyle where the hair is cut at the shoulders, usually indicating a woman who has become a widow or has entered a semi-monastic life (often mandatory for women whose masters/husbands had died).
    *   **Ohaguro (鉄漿/お歯黒):** The practice of blackening teeth, which was a mark of a married woman in the Edo period. Kinpei’s fantasy of Onyagi wearing *ohaguro* signifies his desire to marry her.
*   **Pulp Fiction (Ryoki):** The term *ryoki* (猟奇) refers to a genre of fiction popular in Japan from the late 1920s through the 1950s that focused on the bizarre, the erotic, and the grotesque. This text fits the *ryoki-romance* subgenre.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **孤影慽然 (Koei-sekizen):** A literary four-character idiom (*yojijukugo*) describing a state of being profoundly lonely and sorrowful.
*   **猟奇 (Ryoki):** Originally meaning "seeking the strange," it became a buzzword for sensationalist, often eroticized or macabre fiction.
*   **後架 (Koka):** An archaic term for a toilet/restroom.
*   **窈窕 (Yocho):** A literary term for a woman who is both beautiful and refined/modest.
*   **白魚のような指 (Shirauo no yo na yubi):** Literal: "Fingers like ice-fish." A standard Japanese metaphor for long, slender, white, beautiful fingers.
*   **アヴァンチュール (Aventure):** The French word "aventure" (adventure) written in katakana, used here specifically in the sense of a romantic "affair" or "escapade."
*   **金縛り (Kanashibari):** Usually refers to sleep paralysis, but here used metaphorically to describe Kinpei being frozen or paralyzed by his intense attraction/nervousness.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and Transgression:** The story begins with Kinpei trespassing into a forbidden space (the women's quarters), driven by *ryoki* (morbid curiosity). This sets a tone of illicit excitement.
*   **Giri vs. Ninjo (Duty vs. Emotion):** A classic theme in Japanese literature. Kinpei is a guard (duty/Gennai's orders) but is easily swayed by his sudden, overwhelming passion for Onyagi (emotion).
*   **Virginity and Purity:** The text explicitly mentions Kinpei is a virgin and that Onyagi, despite being a *Churo*, remains "pure" because the Shogun died before they could consummate their union. This "purity" justifies their "pure" love in the eyes of the reader, despite the illegality of their escape.
*   **Escapism:** The characters dream of fleeing the rigid, surveillance-heavy atmosphere of the Edo mansion for a "happier world" in the countryside, reflecting a universal desire for freedom.
