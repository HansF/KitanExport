**二、無盡式インチキ**
**月賦住宅の正体**

月賦と見せかけて実に悪辣なボロ儲けをしている元祖に、「月掛けでわが家」が建つと囃し立てゝいる悪徳業者がある。
一時新聞廣告など利用して派手に宣傳していた大阪市北區小松原町のＡ土建会社がその好例である。
戰災で家を失つた者が血眼で家を求めている窮境につけこみ、月々二千円乃至五千円ぐらいの掛金で、好きな土地に望み通りの家を新築してやると云うのだから、誰でもボツとのぼせてしまう。
実は私も新聞廣告に欺され、Ａ土建を訪問した阿呆の一人であるが、小松原町と云うのは梅田の曾根崎警察から東へ扇町公園に近い一望の焼野原で、かんじんのＡ土建は、焼野原の眞ん中にある吹けば飛ぶようなバラックなんだからおそれ入る。
インチキ会社は直接に客が訪ねてくるのを一番嫌がる。必らず返信料封入を條件に通信する仕掛だから、私は逆にその裏を掻いたのである。
人相の悪い佛頂面の社員が二三人、がた椅子にかけて、つなボロ儲けをしてゐる元祖に、月掛けでわが家」が建つと囃し立てゝいる悪徳業者がある。
（※注：画像内の右端カラムが一部重複・乱丁のような構成になっているため、文脈を繋げて書き起こします）

「七ヶ月月賦で、二十万円（月掛四千円）、十五万円（同三千円）、十万円（同二千円）」と書いてあつた。
「拂いこめばすぐ建つんですか」
「えゝ、立ちどころに建てますよ」
「すでに建つてゐる家を一度見せてください」
「さあ、何分、希望の土地が離れゝですからね」
と渋るのに、私は第六感がピンと働いた。実際に大資本をもつ本當の土建会社なら、即座に喜んで案内してくれるはずである。
「では契約して何回拂いこめば建つんですか」
「それは定つて居ません早い人もおそい人もできますよ」
「へえ？ でも月賦なら妙ですね」
「えへへ、いや、くわしく云いますと、契約者が毎月抽籤しますんでね、入札が最高で落した人から順に一戸ずつ建てるんですよ」
「じゃあ、早く云えば月賦じゃなくて無盡じゃありませんか」
「まあそうなりますかねえ」
「無盡とすれば一組が何人になつているんですか―」
「五百人になつています」
「五百人？ うーん、そしたら一番最後にある人は五百ヶ月後、つまり四十一年八ヶ月目ですかー」
「だからですな、そこのところを早く落すにはですね、えへへ、ちゃんと方法があります」
にやりと賤しい笑顔の裏に、この落札は金さえ握らせばどうにでもなるインチキがひそんでいることを私は敏感に嗅ぎとつた。
「いずれ又……」
「まあ待つて下さい、加入していただけばいろ〜便利な計らいをしますよ」
と引きとめる袖をふり拂つて飛び出した私は、家に困る人々
（以下、文末欠落）

「うん、さうだよ、僕も煙草を節約して助けてやらう」
その後のいろいろ情勢を探つてみると、ミシン界は生産過剰で、四苦八苦を極めて居り、同じ月百円二年拂いで、金利として毎月五分を拂い戻したり、六ヶ月（三千円）拂いこんだ後、もう三千円即金でかためて拂えばミシンを渡してくれ、殘額はほんとうに月賦で、とい云う條件のところもあることがわかつた。
とにかく、ふところの寂しいお客を吊るため、又、にっちもさっちも首のまわらぬ苦しまぎれに、こんな狡い手を考えているインチキ商質がどつと増えてきたから、私たちはよほど墓口と心の紐を締めて居たいものだ。

**2. The Installment-House Scam: A Predatory "Mutual-Aid" Scheme**
**The Truth Behind Installment-Plan Housing**

Among the pioneers of wicked profiteering disguised as installment plans, there are unscrupulous operators loudly advertising that "Monthly payments will build you a home." A prime example is "A-Construction," located in Komatsubara-cho, Kita-ku, Osaka, which was once flashy with its newspaper advertisements. Taking advantage of the desperate situation of those who lost their homes in the war and are searching for a place to live with bloodshot eyes, they claim they will build you the house of your dreams on your preferred land for a monthly premium of just 2,000 to 5,000 yen. It’s enough to make anyone’s head spin.

Truth be told, I was one of the fools deceived by their ads. When I visited this "A-Construction" in Komatsubara-cho—an area near Ogimachi Park, east of the Sonezaki Police Station in Umeda, which is nothing but a vast stretch of burned-out ruins—I was appalled to find that the "company" was nothing more than a flimsy shack in the middle of the rubble that looked like it would blow away in a stiff breeze.

These fraudulent companies hate it when customers visit in person. Their system is designed to keep interactions via mail, always requiring return postage to be enclosed. I decided to flip the script on them. Inside, two or three sour-faced men with unsavory looks were perched on rickety chairs, smoking tobacco over a small hand-warmer. Puffing away, they handed me a pamphlet that read: "Seven-month installments: 200,000 yen (4,000/mo), 150,000 yen (3,000/mo), 100,000 yen (2,000/mo)."

"If I start paying, will you build the house immediately?" I asked.
"Oh yes, we'll have it up in no time," they replied.
"Could you show me a house you’ve already built?"
"Well, you see, the locations the customers chose are quite far away..." they hesitated. My sixth sense immediately kicked in. A real construction company with actual capital would be more than happy to show off its work.

"So, after how many payments does the house get built?"
"There’s no fixed number. Some get theirs early, some later."
"Huh? That's strange for an installment plan."
"Hehe, well, to be precise, the contractors enter a lottery every month. We build one house at a time, starting with whoever wins the bidding or the draw."
"Wait, if you put it like that, this isn't an installment plan—it's a *Mujin* (mutual aid) system, isn't it?"
"I suppose you could call it that."
"If it's a Mujin, how many people are in one group?"
"Five hundred."
"Five hundred?! Well, then the last person in line will get their house in 500 months—that's forty-one years and eight months from now!"
"Ah, but you see... if you want to 'win' the bid sooner, hehe, there are ways to arrange that."

Behind that vulgar, grinning face, I could clearly sense the scam: the "lottery" could be rigged for anyone willing to grease their palms.
"I'll be back another time..." I said.
"Wait, don't go! If you sign up now, we can make 'special arrangements' for you!"
Shaking off the hand grabbing my sleeve, I bolted out. Thinking of the people desperate for housing...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The page is formatted for a mid-20th-century Japanese magazine. It uses a vertical layout with text flowing from right to left. The page is divided into two primary vertical columns.
*   **Typography:** The main title is bold and larger, using traditional kanji forms (like 盡). The sub-header is slightly smaller. The large, hand-drawn hiragana "いんちき" (Inchiki) at the top right serves as a section header or a thematic branding for a series of articles on scams.
*   **Illustration:** A cartoonish, expressive illustration occupies the right side. It depicts a suspicious, sharp-nosed man (the scammer) and a spider-web-like pattern in the background containing money symbols (¥). The building is labeled "インチキ商事" (Scam/Phony Trading Co.), making the satirical nature of the piece clear. The artwork has a rough, woodcut or linocut style typical of the era's magazines.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The large "Inchiki" header and the illustration act as the primary visual anchors. The numbers "二" (Two) indicates this is part of a numbered series.
*   **Pagination:** The number "39" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is an internal page of a larger publication.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Housing Crisis:** The text refers to "burned-out fields" (焼野原 - *yakiato*) and "barracks" (バラック). This is a direct reference to the devastation of Japanese cities (like Osaka, mentioned here) following Allied firebombing raids in 1945. Millions were homeless, living in makeshift shacks, making them prime targets for housing scams.
*   **Mujin (無尽):** A *Mujin* is a traditional Japanese mutual aid financial system where members contribute fixed amounts regularly, and one member receives the "pot" each time through a lottery or bidding. While traditionally used for communal support, unregulated *Mujin* were frequently used by fraudsters in the chaotic post-war economy to create Ponzi-like schemes.
*   **Installment Plans (月賦 - Geppu):** After the war, the concept of buying on credit (installments) was becoming more common but was often poorly understood and unregulated, leading to predatory lending practices.
*   **Sewing Machine Reference:** The lower text mentions the "sewing machine industry" (ミシン界). Sewing machines were highly coveted luxury items and tools for self-sufficiency in the post-war era, and they were also frequently sold through similar shady installment schemes.
*   **Monetary Values:** 2,000 to 5,000 yen per month were significant sums in the late 1940s, when the average monthly wage was very low and inflation was rampant.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **インチキ (Inchiki):** A slang term for fake, fraudulent, or "rigged." It remains in common use today but carries a strong "shady merchant" nuance here.
*   **悪辣 (Akuratsu):** Wicked, unscrupulous, or nefarious. Used to describe the business practices.
*   **ボロ儲け (Boro-moke):** To make a "killing" or "easy money," usually with a negative connotation of profiteering or taking advantage of others.
*   **血眼 (Chimanko):** Literally "bloodshot eyes," used idiomatically to mean "with desperate intensity" or "frantically."
*   **のぼせる (Noboseru):** To get dizzy or light-headed; to be swept away by an idea.
*   **阿呆 (Aho):** Fool/idiot (the Kansai-specific term, fitting for an article set in Osaka).
*   **仏頂面 (Butcho-zura):** A sour, sullen, or grumpy face.
*   **にっちもさっちも (Nicchi mo sacchi mo):** A phrase derived from abacus calculations, meaning to be "stuck in a bind" or "at a dead end."
*   **首が回らない (Kubi ga mawaranai):** Literally "cannot turn one's neck," an idiom meaning to be overwhelmed by debt.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Social Exploitation:** The primary theme is the exploitation of the vulnerable. The author highlights how "vice-traders" (悪徳業者) prey on the "bloodshot" desperation of war victims.
*   **Skepticism of Modernity:** The article reflects a transitional society where traditional systems (like Mujin) were being corrupted by modern commercialism (installment plans and newspaper advertising).
*   **Journalistic Vigilance:** The author adopts the persona of a "wise investigator" who uses his "sixth sense" to unmask the scam. It serves as a cautionary tale for the reader to "keep their heart's purse-strings tight."
*   **Irony and Satire:** The contrast between the "desire-as-expected" dream home and the reality of a "flimsy barrack in a burned field" creates a sharp satirical tone.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay, Exposé, Social Commentary, Satire.
*   **Themes:** Post-war reconstruction, housing crisis, fraud/scams, social justice, poverty, Osaka history.
