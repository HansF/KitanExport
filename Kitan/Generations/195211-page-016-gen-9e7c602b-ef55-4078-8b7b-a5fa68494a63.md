**Header:** 21　　　悲恋の笞刑

「ええ、夕方までには帰えれるわ、そしてお礼もすぐ今日くれるのよ」
「あなたよく行くの？だってあなたの髪短いのに……」
「ポーズによつて違ぅのよ、でも写真のモデルつてああしろ、こうしろ、つて注文つけられるから一寸つらいこともあるのよ、でも辛抱してね、そのかわり一時間千円にもなるんですもの、裸ぢやないつてことだけ保証するからあとのことは我慢してくれる？」
　秋代は言つた。
　黒い長い髪の美しさをとろうというような写真家は芸術家としていろ／＼気むづかしい注文を出すのだろうと思つた。
　何にしても、今日アルバイトの口があるということは、秋代にとつて天から降つた幸運のように嬉しいことだつた。
　というのが、頂度その日は秋代の姉の誕生日だつたのだ。
　姉の真知子はひとりの妹を専門学校にやる為、酒場ずとめをしていた。姉妹二人、小さな部屋を間借りしてつつましく暮している。姉の誕生日だからといつて、秋代には姉の為に贈物を買う小遣いもなかつた。せめて学校の帰えりにその辺の丘を歩いて、野に咲く秋草でも集めてこようと思つていたのだ。
「本当に今日お礼をくれるの？」
　秋代はもう一度念を押しながら、いつか洋品店のショーウインドーでみた黒水晶のネックレスを思いうかべた。本物ではなくても黒く光るネックレスは、姉の白い肌にどんなに美しくうつることだろう。そして、それよりも、意外そうに目を輝かす姉を「フフゝ」とふくみ笑いしながら、いたずらつぽく見ている自分を想像すると、自分で自分がとてもいい子に思えて嬉しかつた。

　良子にともなわれて行つた家は芦屋の高台の映画に出てきそうなプチブルらしい家だつた。
　その庭に面した離れにすでにカメラや照明道具がおかれ、三人ほどの男が二人のくるのを待つていた。
「おそくなりました」
　良子が言うと
「真昼間ランデヴーでもしてたのかい？良子ちやん随分待つたぜ」
　と、部屋の中にいるのにベレーをかぶつた男が親しそうな声をかけた。

## Literal English Translation

**Header:** 21      The Flogging of Tragic Love

"Yes, we can return by evening, and they give the remuneration immediately today, too."
"Do you go often? But your hair is short..."
"It differs depending on the pose. But regarding photo models, because orders are attached saying 'do that' or 'do this,' there are times when it is a little tough, but please endure it, okay? In exchange, it amounts to 1,000 yen for one hour. I guarantee only the fact that it is not nude, so will you tolerate the rest?"
Akiyo said [this].
She thought that a photographer intending to capture the beauty of black long hair would likely issue various difficult orders as an artist.
In any case, the fact that there was an opening for *Arubaito* (part-time work) today was, for Akiyo, a happy thing like good fortune fallen from heaven.
The reason being, that day was exactly Akiyo's older sister's birthday.
Her older sister, Machiko, was doing bar service work in order to send her single younger sister to vocational school. The two sisters were renting a room and living frugally. Just because it was the sister's birthday, Akiyo did not have the pocket money to buy a gift for her sister. She had been thinking she would at least walk the hills in the area on her way back from school and gather autumn grasses blooming in the fields.
"Will they really give the remuneration today?"
While pressing for confirmation one more time, Akiyo called to mind a black crystal necklace she saw in the show window of a Western clothing store sometime ago. Even if not the real thing, how beautifully the black-shining necklace would reflect against her sister's white skin. And, more than that, when she imagined herself looking mischievously while "fufufu" chuckling at her sister whose eyes would shine with surprise, she felt happy thinking of herself as a very good girl.

11

The house she went to while accompanied by Yoshiko was a house on the high ground of Ashiya that seemed like "Petit Bourgeois" style likely to appear in a movie.
In the detached room facing that garden, cameras and lighting tools were already placed, and about three men were waiting for the two to come.
"We are late."
When Yoshiko said this,
"Were you doing a midday *rendezvous* or something? Yoshiko-chan, we waited a long time."
So said a man wearing a beret, despite being inside a room, in a familiar voice.

**Header:** 21      The Flogging of Tragic Love

"Yes, we can be back by evening. And they pay cash on the spot, today."
"Do you go there often? But your hair is so short..."
"It depends on the pose. Listen, being a photo model means taking orders—'do this, do that'—so it can be a little grueling sometimes. But just bear with it, okay? It pays a thousand yen an hour, after all. I can guarantee you won't have to be naked, but can you put up with everything else?"
Akiyo agreed.
She assumed that a photographer seeking to capture the beauty of long black hair would, like any artist, make all sorts of fussy demands.
Regardless, the fact that a gig had opened up today of all days felt like a godsend to Akiyo.
It was, as it happened, her older sister's birthday.
Her sister, Machiko, worked as a bar hostess to put Akiyo through vocational school. The two sisters rented a small room and lived a modest, frugal life. Akiyo had no pocket money to buy a birthday gift. She had planned, at the very least, to walk the hills on her way home from school and gather some wild autumn flowers for her.
"Are you sure they’ll pay us today?"
Akiyo pressed for confirmation once more, her mind drifting to a black crystal necklace she had once seen in a boutique window. It wasn't real crystal, but how beautiful those shining black beads would look against her sister's pale skin. More than the gift itself, she imagined her sister’s eyes lighting up in surprise, and herself watching with a mischievous *fufu* chuckle. The thought made her feel like such a good sister; it made her happy.

11

The house Yoshiko led her to was in the heights of Ashiya—a residence in the "petit bourgeois" style, the kind one might see in the movies.
Cameras and lighting equipment were already set up in a detached building facing the garden, where three men were waiting for their arrival.
"Sorry we're late," Yoshiko said.
"Were you two off on a midday *rendezvous*? We’ve been waiting a long time, Yoshiko," said a man in a familiar tone. Despite being indoors, he was wearing a beret.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** **Fiction (Short Story)**. Specifically, an installment of a serialized story or a standalone short story within a "Kitan" (Strange Tale) genre magazine.
*   **Narrative Structure:**
    *   **Exposition:** Dialogue establishes the premise: a high-paying, slightly suspicious modeling job that guarantees "no nudity" but requires "patience."
    *   **Motivation:** The protagonist (Akiyo) is motivated by financial need and love for her self-sacrificing sister (Machiko). This establishes her innocence and vulnerability.
    *   **Scene Shift:** Movement from the abstract discussion to the physical location (Ashiya), increasing tension.
    *   **Introduction of Antagonists:** The "Man in the Beret" represents the quintessential shady artistic/pornographic director of the era.
*   **Target Audience:** Adult men. The story relies on the *SM trope of the "Innocent Trap"*—a wholesome girl lured into a deviant situation through economic necessity.
*   **Editorial Voice:** The header "Hiren no Chikei" (Flogging of Tragic Love) acts as a spoiler, promising the reader that despite the innocent opening, the story will descend into sadomasochism.

---

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **1,000 Yen per Hour:** In the early-to-mid 1950s (when this was likely published), 1,000 yen was a substantial amount. A university graduate's starting monthly salary was around 10,000 yen. Offering 1,000 yen for an hour of "modeling" signals extreme danger or illegality to the contemporary reader.
*   **Ashiya (芦屋):** A city between Osaka and Kobe, historically associated with the wealthy upper class and Western-style modernism ("Hanshinkan Modernism"). It represents a space of hidden bourgeois decadence detached from the poverty of the common folk.
*   **"Petit Buru" (Petit Bourgeois):** A loan word from French/Marxist theory, widely used in post-war Japan to describe the middle class with a mix of envy and disdain. It implies a certain aesthetic of Westernized comfort.
*   **The "Bar Hostess Sister":** A recurring postwar trope. The older sister sacrifices her virtue (working in the *mizu shōbai* or water trade) to allow the younger sibling to remain "pure" and get an education. This amplifies the tragedy if the younger sister also falls into the sex/fetish industry.
*   **The Beret:** In post-war Japan, the beret was the visual shorthand for "Artist," "Director," or "Intellectual." In *ero-guro* fiction, it often signifies a decadent, voyeuristic antagonist using "art" as a cover for perversion.

---

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Rendezvous (ランデヴー):** Originally French. In Showa Japan, this specifically meant a romantic date, often implying a sexual tryst (love hotel visit). The man using it suggests the girls were off having sex, sexualizing them immediately.
*   **Arubaito (アルバイト):** From German *Arbeit*. Casual/part-time labor.
*   **Shimbou (辛抱):** Translated as "patience" or "endure." In the context of *Kitan Club*, this is a dog-whistle for bondage or torture. "You have to endure the pose" implies physical restraint or painful positioning.
*   **Sakamba-zutome (酒場ずとめ):** Working at a bar/pub. Euphemism for being a hostess, involving pouring drinks and flirting with men, bordering on sex work in the social hierarchy of the time.

---

## Themes & Subtext

*   **The Trap of Innocence:** The text spends significant time establishing Akiyo’s wholesome motivation (buying a necklace for her sister). This maximizes the "sadistic pleasure" for the reader when she inevitably faces the "Flogging" promised in the title.
*   **Economic Coercion:** The story is driven by poverty. The contrast between the "wild autumn flowers" (free, innocent gift) and the "black crystal necklace" (commercial, expensive gift) highlights the corrupting power of money.
*   **Voyeurism & The Male Gaze:** The setup involves three men waiting for two girls. The camera equipment provides a technological justification for the abuse/exploitation that is about to occur.
*   **"Not Nude" (The Fetish Loophole):** The explicit promise that it is "not nude" (裸じゃない) is a genre convention. In *Kitan Club*, this usually means the model will be bound, whipped, or humiliated while clothed or in lingerie, catering to specific fetishes rather than general nudity.

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Genre:** Showa Ero-Guro / Pulp Fiction / SM Literature.
*   **Sexual Content:** Implicit / Fetishistic.
*   **Themes:** Economic exploitation, Voyeurism, Submission, Sadomasochism (implied by title).
*   **Warning:** The title "Flogging of Tragic Love" indicates non-consensual or dubiously consensual violence is imminent in the narrative.
