**ＳＭ街道を西に東に**

辻村さんは、やっぱり東京ですね、チャンスを作って又出てきますと感慨深そうに東京をたっていきました。
　私のカメラハントも合格したようで東京方面のハント希望者をリストアップして送るので宜しく頼むとの依頼の手紙が来ました。賀山さん此れを機会にプレイの写真でもハントの写真でも送って下さい。私も送りますので交換型式をとりませんか、そして東と西で大いに活躍しましょう。お互いに好きな道で頑張りましょうと辻村さんの激励の便りでした。

　私もこうなったらＳＭ街道まっしぐらと手初めに辻村さんと一緒にカメラハントした左近麻理子さんとの再会の約束を果たすために愛用のロープをバックにつめて名古屋に向いました。会うなり左近さんは、
「賀山さん御免なさい今日は余り時間がないのですよ」
　私はそれは大変と一直線にホテルに行くことにしました。今日は私がリーダーですので左近さんに一風呂浴びて下さいとお願いして私は冷蔵庫よりビールを出して一ぱい飲んで勢いをつけるのでした。風呂から上ってきた左近さんに此方へ来て下さいと備え付けの座椅子に両足を伸ばして座らせました。両手を座椅子の背にしっかりと後手縛りにしてから両足を押えつけるように両股びらきのスタイルで開けるだけ開かせて座椅子の固定しました。
　左近さんはその知らぬ顔をしておりますが、自分がどんな恥しい格好をさせられているのかは承知しているようでした。
　彼女の秘めたる花びらもきれいに左右に開いてその奥所もパッチリと目の前に息づいておりました。屈辱的な姿勢をとらされあらぬ所を眺められる羞しさに一人耐えているマゾの女の風情をみせておりました。
　乳房にナワ掛けしてそのまゝ暫らく放置して眺めることにしました。
　煽情的な彼女のポーズをみて心なしか私のジュニアーもふくらみをましてきました。しかし彼女を犯したいと云うよりこれがＳＭの心情ではないかと思いました。
　暫らくたつと彼女の表情は羞しさの中にやすらぎというか喜びというか演技ではないＭ

**SM街道を西に東に**

辻村さんは、「やはり東京ですね、チャンスを作ってまた出てきます」と感慨深そうに東京を立っていきました。
　私のカメラハントも合格したようで、東京方面のハント希望者をリストアップして送るのでよろしく頼む、との依頼の手紙が来ました。「賀山さん、これを機会にプレイの写真でもハントの写真でも送ってください。私も送りますので交換形式をとりませんか。そして東と西で大いに活躍しましょう。お互いに好きな道で頑張りましょう」という辻村さんの激励の便りでした。

　私もこうなったらSM街道まっしぐらと、手始めに辻村さんと一緒にカメラハントした左近麻理子さんとの再会の約束を果たすために、愛用のロープをバッグに詰めて名古屋に向かいました。会うなり左近さんは、
「賀山さんごめんなさい、今日はあまり時間がないのですよ」
　私はそれは大変と一直線にホテルに行くことにしました。今日は私がリーダーですので、左近さんに「一風呂浴びてください」とお願いして、私は冷蔵庫よりビールを出して一杯飲んで勢いをつけるのでした。風呂から上がってきた左近さんに「こちらへ来てください」と、備え付けの座椅子に両足を伸ばして座らせました。両手を座椅子の背にしっかりと後ろ手縛りにしてから、両足を押さえつけるように両股開きのスタイルで開けるだけ開かせて座椅子の固定しました。
　左近さんはそ知らぬ顔をしておりますが、自分がどんな恥ずかしい格好をさせられているのかは承知しているようでした。
　彼女の秘めたる花びらもきれいに左右に開いて、その奥所もぱっちりと目の前に息づいておりました。屈辱的な姿勢をとらされ、あらぬ所を眺められる恥ずかしさに一人耐えているマゾの女の風情を見せておりました。
　乳房に縄掛けして、そのまましばらく放置して眺めることにしました。
　扇情的な彼女のポーズを見て、心なしか私のジュニアも膨らみを増してきました。しかし彼女を犯したいというより、これがSMの心情ではないかと思いました。
　しばらく経つと彼女の表情は恥ずかしさの中に、安らぎというか喜びというか、演技ではないM……。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**SM Highway, to the West, to the East**

Tsujimura-san, saying "As expected, it's Tokyo, isn't it? I will create a chance and come out again," left Tokyo appearing deep in emotion. 
My "camera hunt" also seemed to have passed [his standards], and a letter of request came saying he would list up hunt-hopefuls in the Tokyo area and send them, so please take care of it. "Kayama-san, take this opportunity to send photos of play or photos of hunts. I will also send some, so why don't we take an exchange format? And let's be very active in the East and West. Let's both do our best in the path we like," was the letter of encouragement from Tsujimura-san.

I, thinking "if it has come to this, I'm heading straight down the SM Highway," to fulfill a promise of reunion with Sakon Mariko-san, whom I had camera-hunted with Tsujimura-san at the beginning, packed my favorite ropes into my bag and headed for Nagoya. As soon as we met, Sakon-san said, 
"Kayama-san, I'm sorry, I don't have much time today." 
I thought "That is serious," and decided to go straight to a hotel. Since today I am the leader, I requested Sakon-san to "please take a bath," and I took a beer from the refrigerator and drank a glass to gain momentum. To Sakon-san who came up from the bath, I said "please come here" and made her sit on the provided floor chair (zaisu) with both legs extended. After firmly tying both hands behind her back to the back of the floor chair, as if pressing down both legs, I made her open them as much as they would open in a both-thighs-open style and fixed [them] to the floor chair.
Sakon-san was putting on an indifferent face, but she seemed aware of what kind of embarrassing appearance she was being made to take.
Her hidden flower petals also opened beautifully to the left and right, and that deep place was breathing right before my eyes. Made to take a humiliating posture, she showed the air of a masochistic woman enduring alone the shame of having improper places gazed upon.
I put rope-work on her breasts and decided to leave her like that for a while and gaze.
Looking at her suggestive pose, perhaps it was just my imagination, but my "junior" increased in swelling. However, rather than wanting to violate her, I thought "Is this not the true heart of SM?"
After a while passed, her expression, within the shame, was a sense of peace or perhaps joy—not acting, an M [masochist]...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**East and West Along the SM Highway**

"Tokyo is the place to be, after all," Tsujimura-san said with deep emotion as he departed the city. "I’ll find another opportunity to come back." 
It seemed my "camera hunting" skills had met his approval; I received a letter from him asking me to handle a list of prospective models in the Tokyo area. He wrote: "Kayama-san, please use this chance to send me photos of your sessions and 'hunts.' I’ll send mine in return—let’s start an exchange. We can both be major players, you in the West and me in the East. Let’s give it our all on the path we've chosen." It was a letter of great encouragement.

Resolved to plunge headlong down the "SM Highway," I packed my favorite ropes into my bag and headed for Nagoya to fulfill a promise to reunite with Mariko Sakon, the woman I had first "hunted" alongside Tsujimura-san. Upon meeting, Mariko said, "Kayama-san, I’m so sorry, but I don’t have much time today."
"That won't do," I thought, and took her straight to a hotel. Since I was the "leader" for the day, I asked her to take a bath first. Meanwhile, I grabbed a beer from the fridge and downed it to steady my nerves and build some momentum. When she emerged from the bath, I told her to come over and made her sit on a floor chair with her legs stretched out. I bound her hands firmly behind her to the back of the chair, then forced her legs as wide as they would go in a spread-eagle style, securing them to the chair.
Though Mariko maintained a stoic, indifferent face, she clearly understood the humiliating spectacle she had been turned into.
Her "hidden petals" were parted beautifully, and her innermost parts seemed to breathe right there before my eyes. Forced into such a degrading position, she exuded the aura of a true masochist, silently enduring the shame of having her most private areas stared at.
I tied ropes across her breasts and decided to leave her like that for a while, simply to observe.
Gazing at her provocative pose, I felt myself becoming aroused. Yet, more than a desire to simply take her, I felt that this—this very moment—was the true essence of the SM spirit.
As time passed, her expression shifted. Amidst the shame, there was a look of peace, or perhaps joy. It wasn't an act; she was a true masochist...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is structured like a typical Japanese "fetish" or "men's" magazine of the mid-Showa era. It uses vertical text (tate-gaki) reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The title uses a bold, sans-serif Gothic font for impact. The body text is a standard Mincho (serif) typeface.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "SM街道を西に東に" (SM Highway West to East) sits at the top right, followed by narrative text that flows around a central photograph.
*   **Photography:** A black-and-white high-contrast photograph occupies the lower center/left of the page. It depicts a woman (Sakon Mariko) in a state of partial undress, bound to a chair in a "thigh-spread" (mata-biraki) position. The photo is staged to emphasize vulnerability and the "resignation" mentioned in the caption.
*   **Page Numbering:** The number "21" is visible at the bottom left, suggesting this is a feature within a larger publication.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely the late 1950s or 1960s (Showa 30s-40s). This was the "golden age" of independent fetish magazines in Japan (often called *fuzoku zasshi* or *abunai zasshi*).
*   **Camera Hunt (カメラハント):** This term refers to a subculture where amateur photographers or enthusiasts would scout for women (often aspiring models or "amateurs") to photograph in erotic or fetishistic contexts. It was a common trope in mid-century Japanese erotica, blurring the line between documentary and fiction.
*   **SM (Sado-Masochism):** In Japan, "SM" became a popularized term for bondage and power-play aesthetics, heavily influenced by artists like Seiu Ito. The text reflects a burgeoning "hobbyist" community where practitioners exchanged photos and tips through mail-order magazines.
*   **Nagoya vs. Tokyo:** The text mentions traveling between these cities, highlighting the "East/West" (Kanto/Kansai-Tokai) regional pride that often appeared in these enthusiast circles.
*   **Shibari (Bondage):** The description of "gote-shibari" (back-hand tie) and "nawa-gake" (rope-work on breasts) are specific technical terms in Japanese bondage culture.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **SM街道 (SM Kaidō):** Metaphorical "SM Highway." It suggests a dedicated path or lifestyle revolving around sado-masochism.
*   **激励 (Gekirei):** Usually written as 激励. It means intense encouragement or urging.
*   **ジュニア (Junior):** A common mid-century euphemism for the penis.
*   **花びら (Hanabira):** Literally "flower petals." A poetic euphemism for the labia.
*   **奥所 (Okuso):** Literally "deep place" or "inner place." Refers to the vagina or the deeper parts of the genitalia.
*   **風情 (Fuzei):** Appearance, air, or "vibe." Here it describes her "masochistic aura."
*   **座椅子 (Zaisu):** A traditional Japanese chair with a backrest but no legs, used on tatami mats.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Cultivated" Masochist:** A recurring theme in this genre is the discovery of "true" masochism. The narrator observes the model and concludes her look of "resignation" (諦め) is actually a form of "joy" (喜び), suggesting that her nature is being "awakened" by the bondage.
*   **Professionalism vs. Amateurism:** The exchange of "camera hunt" lists between Kayama and Tsujimura suggests an organized, albeit underground, network of enthusiasts who viewed their hobby with a degree of "professional" seriousness (using terms like "leader" and "passed/合格").
*   **Voyeurism and Control:** The narrative emphasizes the narrator's control—ordering the bath, setting the pose, and choosing to "gaze" (眺める) rather than immediately engage in sex. The pleasure is derived from the visual and psychological dominance of the "shibari" act.
*   **The "Staged" Narrative:** Like many stories in these magazines, there is a "confessional" or "reportage" style, meant to make the reader feel like they are getting a peek into a real underground world, regardless of whether the event was a scripted photo shoot.
