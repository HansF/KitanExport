係官の一人は半裸にされた老婆の背中の肉づきを見て、唸るようにつぶやいた。
「四十五六の間違いぢやありませんかね、髪も黒いし」

「——」
声のない無言の驚愕の叫びが、彼等の間にツツと流れた。
此れが六十三の老婆であろうか、豊かな雨の乳房、鹿の子餅の滑らかさを持つた弾力のある肌、程よい脂肪に膨らんだ腰の線、それに下腹部から太腿へと……。
彼等はアッ、と声をのんだ。毛髪は漆黒に染されていたが、いくら彼女でも、そこまでは気がつかなかつたであろう、一種言うに言われぬ妖気が、ほのぼのと立ちのぼつてくるのであつた。
現場の不自然さときぬ婆さんのアブノーマルな変態から疑問を持つた刑事の追求の前に、正雄は簡単に犯行を自供した。
　きぬ婆さんには、八王子に血縁は一人もなかつた。彼女が生活のために考えついたのが、素人下宿であつた。昭和二十二年二月初旬、下宿を求めて彼女をたよつて来たのが正雄であつた。
彼は奥多摩から八王子郵便局に通勤していた。それから間もなく彼はおきぬ婆さんの家に起居することになつた。
彼女は、結婚して間もなく夫に死別して、以来四十年近くも孤独で通して来たのであつたが、今になつて正雄と言う若い男の潑刺とした肉体を前にして、今まで眠つていた性的欲望がむく／＼と盛り上つてくるのをどうすることも出来なかつた。
　それは三月上旬の雨模様でネットリとした暖かさが肌を包む夜であつた。局から帰つた正雄は夕食後の所在なさを、嘗てがわれた二階の一室で、もてあまして講談本にひまをつぶしていた。
気のよい親切なお婆さんだと気の許していた彼女の肉体が、余りにも齢とかけ離れた艷々しさを持つて、正雄の若々しい身体に襲いかかつてきたのは此の時であつた。
こうして彼の童貞は、おきぬ婆さんによつて破られた。そしてその瞬間から正雄は彼女と一つ床にして寝る間柄となつた。今迄貯積したエネルギーの爆発は、急激な目覺めとなつて、彼女は一晩でも彼を一人でおくことはなかつた。
甘い歓楽に酔う連夜が、続いて邪戀に狂う肉の饗宴も、いつしか近所の人の噂に上つた。
白髪を染め化粧に急に若やいだ老婆、彼女にしてみれば、六十三になつて初めて人生の生き甲斐を見出したわけであつたろう。彼女の正雄を失うことを恐れることは非常なものがあつた。
正雄に世帯を持たせる、月々千圓の小遣を渡す——
こうした約束が二人の間で交わされたのも此の頃であつた。
が然し彼女にとつては、彼女自身の生活費以外に、正雄に千圓もやるということは、實に至難なことであつた。
といつて内からわきいでる肉体の要求には打ち勝てなかつた。六、月となり七月となり世はもうすつかり夏となつた。彼女は正雄に約束の千圓を支拂うことが出来なくなつたが、正雄を愛撫する度は益々激しくなつた。
さしも頑健な体格を誇つていた正雄も消耗し盡して来たし、朝も昼も區別のないおきぬ婆さんの甜める様にネバ〜した情熱の前にはもはや耐えられなくなつてきた。
初め奉公人のつもりで、毎晩彼女の抱擁に身をまかしていた彼は、月々の小遣が、滯り勝ちになつてくると、ようやく、欺まされたと氣付いた。
事實、その頃のおきぬ婆さんには金はなかつたのである。
しかし月々千圓の小遣を貰うつもりをしていた彼は、既に相当多額の金を友達から借金して費消してしまつていた。
その頃からおきぬ婆さんの持物が次々と正雄の手によつて姿を消して行つた。覺め果てない情痴の渦巻の中に酔つていた彼女には、最初はそれには全く氣付かないでいた。
が十月になつた或る日。
次第に失われてゆく持物に氣付いた彼女は、彼に對するやみがたい邪戀と生活のジレンマに悩みながらも遂に彼をたしなめたことから激しい口論となつた。
夜毎の激しい彼女の愛撫に拘らず金の自由にならぬことから兇暴性を帯びてきた正雄は、突如殺意を感じた。
愛するが爲に身体をまかした彼ではなかつた。只生活の方便のためにする／＼とおきぬ婆さんの巣籠中のものとなつて、精力を使い果した彼には、もはや逞ましい生活意識なんかは存在しなかつた。
斧を彼女の頭へ叩き込んで、現場を強盗らしく細工はしたものの、刑事の慧眼は胡魔化せなかつた。六十三になるエロ婆、おきぬはその邪戀に狂つた半生の愛慾生活を、最愛の男の手によつて、死の結末を遂げたのであつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(The clothes) are peeled off. Every time, a famous machine's shutter is accurately cut. 
Kinu was wearing a muslin nightgown with a wisteria pattern on a purple background. When that was removed, in the grisly scene, a flash of fire-like scarlet loincloth appeared.
"Hmm, for a 63-year-old crone, she is considerably youthful..."
One of the officials, looking at the fleshiness of the half-naked crone's back, muttered as if groaning.
"Isn't it a mistake for 45 or 46? Her hair is black too,"
one of the detectives says to the investigation chief. From anyone's eyes, it could only be seen as a body in its thirties.
The detective's scalpel ruthlessly gouges the secrets of Mother Kinu's body. The loincloth was also carefully removed.
Thud, the victim was turned onto her back.
"—"
A soundless cry of wordless shock flowed between them like a 'tsutsu'.
Is this a 63-year-old crone? Plump breasts like rain, elastic skin with the smoothness of kanoko-mochi, a waistline swollen with just the right amount of fat, and then from the lower abdomen to the thighs...
They inhaled a breath with an "Ah!". The hair was dyed jet black, but even she likely didn't realize that far—a kind of unspeakable eerie aura was faintly rising up.
Before the pursuit of the detective, who held doubts from the unnaturalness of the scene and Mother Kinu's abnormal perversion, Masao easily confessed to the crime.
Mother Kinu had not a single blood relative in Hachioji. What she thought of for a living was an amateur boarding house. In early February, Showa 22 (1947), it was Masao who came relying on her seeking a room.
He was commuting from Okutama to the Hachioji Post Office. Shortly after that, he came to live and eat in Mother Kinu's house.
She had lost her husband shortly after marriage and had spent nearly forty years in solitude since then, but now, faced with the lively flesh of the young man called Masao, she could do nothing about the sexual desire that had been sleeping until now swelling up 'muku-muku'.
It was a night in early March with rainy weather where a sticky warmth wrapped the skin. Masao, who returned from the office, was killing time with a Kodan book in the second-floor room he had been assigned, feeling at a loose end after dinner.
Her body, which he had let his guard down around thinking she was a good-natured, kind old lady, possessing a glossiness too far removed from her age, attacked Masao's youthful body at this time.
In this way, his virginity was broken by Mother Kinu. And from that moment, Masao became in a relationship of sleeping in one bed with her. The explosion of energy accumulated until now became a sudden awakening, and she would not leave him alone for even one night.
Every night intoxicated by sweet pleasure continued, and the feast of flesh driven mad by wicked love eventually rose to the rumors of the neighborhood people.
An old woman who suddenly looked younger with dyed white hair and makeup—for her, it must have been that she found a reason for living for the first time at sixty-three. Her fear of losing Masao was something extraordinary.
Making a household for Masao, giving him 1,000 yen pocket money monthly—
It was around this time that such a promise was exchanged between the two.
But for her, besides her own living expenses, giving Masao as much as 1,000 yen was a truly difficult thing.
That said, she could not win against the demands of the flesh welling up from within. June came, July came, and the world became completely summer. She became unable to pay the promised 1,000 yen to Masao, but the degree of her caressing Masao became more and more intense.
Even Masao, who boasted a robust physique, had become exhausted, and before the "sticky" (neba-neba) passion of Mother Kinu, who licked him without distinction of morning or noon, he could no longer endure.
Initially intending to be a servant, he who had left his body to her embrace every night, when the monthly pocket money became prone to delays, finally realized he had been deceived.
In fact, Mother Kinu at that time had no money.
However, he who intended to receive 1,000 yen pocket money monthly had already borrowed and spent a considerably large amount of money from friends.
From around that time, Mother Kinu's belongings began to disappear one after another by Masao's hand. She, who was intoxicated in a whirlpool of never-ending carnal obsession, at first did not notice that at all.
But on a certain day in October.
Noticing her belongings gradually being lost, while suffering from the dilemma of her uncontrollable wicked love for him and her life, she finally rebuked him, leading to a violent argument.
Despite the intense nightly caresses, Masao, who had become violent because money was not free, suddenly felt murderous intent.
He was not one who surrendered his body because he loved her. Just for the sake of convenience of living, having become the "nesting" thing of Mother Kinu and having exhausted his energy, there no longer existed any kind of vigorous life-consciousness for him.
Driving an axe into her head, although he crafted the scene to look like a robbery, the detective's keen eye could not be fooled. The "Ero-Baba" (lecherous crone) turning sixty-three, O-Kinu, met a deadly end at the hands of her most beloved man, finishing a half-life of lustful living driven mad by that wicked love.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The detectives continued to undress the body. With every layer removed, the shutter of a high-end camera clicked with clinical precision. Kinu had been wearing a muslin nightgown, its purple fabric adorned with a weeping wisteria pattern. When they pulled it away, a flash of scarlet—her underskirt—burned vividly against the grim scene.

"Hmm... for a woman of sixty-three, she's remarkably well-preserved," one official muttered, his voice a low growl of disbelief as he took in the firm flesh of the half-naked woman's back.

"Are you sure she isn't forty-five or six? Even her hair is pitch black," another detective remarked to the lead investigator. To any observer, her physique appeared no older than that of a woman in her thirties.

The detective’s gaze acted like a scalpel, ruthlessly exposing the secrets of the old woman’s body. Even her loincloth was meticulously removed. With a heavy thud, the victim was rolled onto her back.

Silence fell—a wordless, collective gasp of shock that rippled through the men. Was this truly a woman of sixty-three? She possessed the full, rounded breasts of a much younger woman; her skin was as smooth and elastic as rice cakes, her waist curved with a perfect amount of softness, leading down the line of her hips to her thighs...

The men caught their breath. Her hair was dyed jet black, but even she couldn't have hidden the strange, inexplicable aura—a faint, haunting sensuality—that seemed to drift from her corpse. Faced with the unnatural state of the crime scene and the evidence of Kinu's "abnormal" sexual habits, the suspect, Masao, quickly broke under interrogation and confessed.

Kinu had no relatives in Hachioji. To support herself, she had opened a modest boarding house. It was in early February of 1947 that Masao, looking for a room, first sought her out. He commuted to the Hachioji Post Office from Okutama. Shortly thereafter, he moved into Kinu’s house. Kinu had been widowed shortly after her marriage and had lived in solitude for nearly forty years. But confronted with Masao’s youthful vitality, her long-dormant sexual desires surged uncontrollably.

It happened on a night in early March, the air thick with a cloying, rainy warmth. Masao had returned from the office and was killing time in his second-floor room, leafing through a book to stave off post-dinner boredom. He had viewed her as nothing more than a kind, harmless old woman—until that moment when her body, possessed of a lustrousness that defied her age, fell upon his youthful frame.

That was how Masao lost his virginity to the old woman. From that night on, they shared a bed. The explosion of her long-repressed energy became a frantic awakening; she refused to let him out of her sight for even a single night. Their nightly indulgences soon turned into a feverish "banquet of the flesh," and before long, the neighborhood was rife with rumors.

Kinu, now dyeing her hair and applying heavy makeup, seemed to have found a reason for living for the first time at sixty-three. Her fear of losing Masao became pathological. She promised to set him up in his own home and give him a monthly allowance of a thousand yen.

However, for Kinu, providing such a sum on top of her own expenses was nearly impossible. Yet, she could not suppress the demands of her flesh. As spring turned to summer, she found herself unable to pay the promised allowance, even as her demands for his affection grew more frantic. Masao, once robust, found himself physically drained. He could no longer endure the "sticky," relentless passion of the old woman, who sought him out at all hours of the day and night.

Having initially submitted to her embraces like a servant, Masao realized he had been played as the money began to dry up. In reality, Kinu was broke. But Masao, counting on that thousand yen, had already borrowed and spent a fortune from his friends. He began to steal Kinu’s belongings and sell them off. Initially, Kinu—blinded by her carnal obsession—didn't notice.

By October, however, the truth came out. Torn between her uncontrollable lust and the reality of her dwindling possessions, she finally rebuked him. A violent argument ensued. Frustrated by his lack of funds and exhausted by her nightly demands, Masao was suddenly seized by a murderous impulse.

He had never loved her; he had merely surrendered his body for the sake of convenience. Having been drained of his vitality in Kinu’s "nest," Masao no longer possessed any real will to live a normal life. He drove an axe into her head and attempted to stage the scene as a robbery, but he could not fool the keen eyes of the detectives. And so O-Kinu, the "lecherous crone" of sixty-three, met her end at the hands of the man she loved most, a violent conclusion to a life consumed by "wicked" desire.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in vertical columns (tategaki), typical of Japanese publications. There are roughly 21 columns of text.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Ming-style (Mincho), common in mid-20th-century printing. Some kanji are pre-reform forms (e.g., 氣, 對, 爲), and the text uses historical kana orthography in places (though it is largely modernizing).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "— 12 —" is centered at the bottom. The text is dense, with little margin, suggesting a low-budget pulp magazine or newspaper supplement.
*   **Formatting Elements:**
    *   Quotation marks (「 」) are used for dialogue.
    *   The use of the wave dash (~) in "ネバ〜した" (sticky/persistent) is a notable stylistic choice to emphasize the "slimy" or "cloying" nature of the woman's passion.
    *   Iteration marks (く, 々) are used (e.g., むく／＼, 艶々).
*   **Content Tone:** The writing is sensationalist and voyeuristic. It lingers on descriptions of the corpse's "youthful" appearance and uses derogatory terms like "エロ婆" (Ero-Baba / lecherous crone).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era:** Mention of "Showa 22" (1947) dates the story to the early post-war occupation period. This was the height of the **Kasutori** (pulp) magazine era in Japan.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** Named after a low-quality dregs-liquor, *Kasutori* magazines were cheap, sensationalist publications focusing on "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense). They often featured true crime, sexual deviance, and "scandalous" social behavior.
*   **Social Conventions:** The text reflects a deep social anxiety regarding aging women and their sexuality. The term "abnormal perversion" (*abunōmaru na hentai*) was often used in this era to pathologize any sexual behavior deemed outside the traditional family structure.
*   **Economic Context:** The 1,000 yen allowance was a significant sum in 1947, reflecting the severe inflation and economic desperation of the immediate post-war years. The story highlights the transactional nature of the relationship, which was common in the "pan-pan" and amateur boarding house subcultures of the time.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **メリンス (Merinsu):** Muslin. A soft wool or cotton fabric often used for indoor Japanese clothing.
*   **湯巻 (Yumaki):** A traditional loincloth or wrap-around skirt worn by women under kimonos or while bathing.
*   **鹿の子餅 (Kanoko-mochi):** A type of soft, dappled dango or mochi. Used here as a metaphor for soft, supple skin.
*   **邪戀 (Jaren / Jaren):** "Wicked love" or "illicit passion." Implies a love that is morally wrong or destructive.
*   **甜める (Nameru):** Usually written as 舐める (to lick). The use of the rare kanji 甜 suggests a "sweet" but cloying licking.
*   **ネバ〜した (Neba-shita):** From *neba-neba* (sticky/slimy). Used here metaphorically to describe a suffocating, persistent sexual obsession.
*   **エロ婆 (Ero-baba):** A derogatory term ("Lecherous old woman" or "Sexy crone").
*   **慧眼 (Keigan):** Keen eye; insight; bird's-eye view. Refers to the detective's sharp perception.
*   **情痴 (Jōchi):** Carnal obsession; being blinded by love/lust.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **The Grotesque Body:** The text focuses heavily on the contrast between the woman's chronological age (63) and her "youthful" physical appearance. This creates a sense of the "uncanny" or "supernatural" (妖気 - *yōki*), suggesting that her vitality is monstrous or unnatural.
*   **Male Victimhood vs. Female Predation:** Despite Masao being the murderer, the narrative portrays him as a victim of the woman's insatiable lust. He is "exhausted" (*shōmo*) and "drained" (*精力を使い果たした*), framing the murder as an almost inevitable explosion of repressed masculine energy against a devouring female force.
*   **Sensationalism:** The detailed description of the corpse's nudity and the "shutter of the camera" clicking emphasizes the voyeuristic nature of the reporting.
*   **Economic Despair:** The tragedy is fueled by the inability to maintain a middle-class facade (the 1,000 yen allowance) in a broken post-war economy.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction (likely "True Crime" fiction / *Jitsuwa-mono*), Magazine Article.
*   **Genre:** Ero-Guro (Erotic-Grotesque), Pulp, Noir, Crime.
*   **Themes:** Murder, Obsession, Aging, Sexuality, Post-war Japan, Gender Roles, Poverty.
*   **Classification:** Mature (Sexual themes, violence, descriptions of a corpse).
