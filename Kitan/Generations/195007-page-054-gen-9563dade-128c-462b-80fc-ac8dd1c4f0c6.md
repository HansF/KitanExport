**[Top Section - Conclusion of a previous story]**
思はず息をのみ、茫然として立つている彼へ、女はいたずらつぽく、婉然と微笑みかけた。それは洗練された肉感的な微笑だつた。
もはや彼は思考力を失つて仕舞つた。
三
淡い虚脱感を悔いの色が彼の頬に侘しく浮んでいた。彼は米搗場へ引返すと、再び杵を握りしめた。
彼は残つている力の限り、突き下しては、振り上げた。
美しい裸身が、白い映像となつて彼の脳裏に甦がえり、それが大きく迫つて来ては、小さく離れ、ぐるぐると廻つては消えた。
別れ際に彼女が唇を寄せ、熱い息で囁いた甘いひびきの言葉の数々が、しきりに彼を悩ました。
パッと黄色い閃光がきらめき、米搗場の周囲の荒れ果てた畑で、数発の砲弾が炸裂した。強い硝煙の匂いがしばらく漂つていた。
白の籾の中に、女のなめらかで逞ましい肉體が浮び、慾情に酔いしれた黒い瞳がだる気に微笑んでいる。
彼はがむしゃらに杵をふるつた。汗が瀧のように流れては落ちていつた。
黄昏近い戦場の片隅で、彼は、機械のように、同じ動作をいつまでも繰り返していた。

Unintentionally holding breath, toward him standing in a daze, the woman mischievously, captivatingly smiled. It was a refined sensual smile. Already he lost thinking power completely.
3
Faint empty feeling and color of regret on his cheeks miserably were floating. He returning to rice-pounding place, again the pestle gripped. He as much as remaining strength, striking down, swung up. Beautiful naked body, as white image in his brain revived, it largely approaching, smallly separating, round and round turning disappeared. At parting time she lips brought close, with hot breath whispered sweet-sounding words many, incessantly him troubled. Pop, yellow flash sparkled, in rice-pounding place's surrounding ruined fields, several shells exploded. Strong gunpowder smell for a while drifted. In white husks, woman's smooth and sturdy flesh floated, in lust intoxicated black eyes languidly are smiling. He recklessly pestle swung. Sweat like waterfall flowing fell away. Twilight-near battlefield's corner, he, like a machine, same movement forever was repeating. (End)

**[Top Section: The End of a Soldier's Fever Dream]**
He stood there, breath catching in his throat, utterly dazed. The woman gave him a playful, enchanting smile—a smile of refined sensuality. In that moment, his capacity for rational thought vanished. 
Part 3: A faint sense of hollow exhaustion and the shadow of regret played miserably across his cheeks. Returning to the rice-pounding shed, he gripped the heavy pestle once more. With every ounce of strength he had left, he drove it down and swung it back up. The image of her beautiful, naked form flickered in his mind like a pale white specter, looming large one moment before shrinking away, spinning in circles until it vanished. The sweet, resonant words she had whispered with hot breath as they parted continued to torment him.
Suddenly, a yellow flash erupted. In the desolate fields surrounding the shed, several artillery shells exploded. The pungent scent of gunpowder hung in the air. Amidst the white rice husks, the woman's smooth, sturdy body seemed to float; her black eyes, intoxicated with lust, smiled languidly at him. He swung the pestle with reckless abandon, sweat pouring off him like a waterfall. There, in a corner of the battlefield as twilight approached, he continued to repeat the same mechanical motions, over and over again.
(The End)

**[Bottom Section: The Spy of Love—Secrets of the Sulfuric Acid Incident]**
By Kotaro Hara

"Won't you go with me?" she was asked. Hanako had no idea that this was part of a vengeful plot by Mr. Sakagami to lure Hatsue back to his villa. Unaware of his ulterior motives, Hanako replied, "Yes, Hatsue mentioned the other day that she wanted to find a place for the two of them to live together as a sort of private celebration for Ryu..."
"I see. That’s excellent," Sakagami said, his expression suddenly brightening. A few days later, he called Hanako out of the blue. "I’ve found a suitable house," he commanded. "I’ll be waiting at Mikage Station on the Hanshin line. Make sure you bring Hatsue with you."
Hanako immediately reached out to her friend. "Hatsue, I’ve found a great house. Let me show it to you."
On the night of November 17th, Hanako arrived at Mikage Station ahead of time. Waiting in the shadows was a car with its lights extinguished. When Hatsue finally appeared, Sakagami emerged silently from the darkness and lunged, grabbing his former lover's arm with a vice-like grip.
"Hatsue!"
"Ah! It’s you? Mr. Sakagami, please, let me go!"
Ignoring her pleas, Sakagami wordlessly shoved the struggling woman into the car. "You’re coming, too," he barked at Hanako, dragging her inside as well.
As the car tore through the pitch-black night, Hanako listened to the violent argument erupting between the two. For the first time, she realized the dark, tangled web of their affair and learned that "Mr. Sakagami" had been using the alias Miyamoto. A young, innocent woman of twenty, Hanako began to tremble uncontrollably with terror. Though she begged to be let out, Sakagami shouted her down. "You’re staying with us!" He refused to let her go until they reached his house. When she was finally permitted to leave the car, Hanako fled home, her heart filled with a terrible dread for Hatsue’s safety.
The following day, Hanako was summoned by the Nishinomiya City Police. What she learned there nearly made her faint. In a fit of jealous rage, Sakagami had dragged Hatsue into his home, brutally assaulted her, and then doused her in sulfuric acid—a horrific attempt to bring the curtain down on their "festered" love triangle. 
Drenched from head to toe in acid, Hatsue had somehow managed to escape. She was found collapsed on the roadside by a patrolling officer, clinging to life. It had been less than twenty days, yet Hanako realized with a shudder that her role as an unwitting "spy" had gouged open the ugly underbelly of these people's lives and played a pivotal part in this catastrophic ending. For a twenty-year-old who knew nothing of the darker side of human nature, the shock was enough to make her world collapse.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The page follows a standard two-part vertical column layout common in Japanese magazines. The top contains the finale of a serialized story (marked with "三" for Part 3 and "終" for End). The bottom features a sensationalist "true crime" or "true-story-style" fiction piece.
*   **Typography:** The text uses traditional vertical setting (tategaki). The title "恋のスパイ" (Spy of Love) uses a stylized, slightly heavier font to grab attention. Subtitles and author names are clearly demarcated.
*   **Illustration:** The central illustration is a dramatic, high-contrast line drawing showing a man forcefully grabbing a woman while another woman looks on. This "noire" style was iconic for *kasutori* magazines, emphasizing drama and peril.
*   **Formatting Elements:** The use of brackets for dialogue 「 」 and punctuation like "～" for emphasis or prolonged sounds (がた～と) are typical of the era.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the largest element, followed by the illustration, then the body text. The top story is separated by a horizontal line, indicating it is distinct content.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War Japan):** The mention of "西宮市警" (Nishinomiya City Police) is a crucial historical marker. From 1948 to 1954, Japan operated under a decentralized police system where cities had their own autonomous police forces. This places the story squarely in the Allied Occupation or early post-independence era.
*   **Sulfuric Acid Attacks (Ryūsan Jiken):** In the late 1940s and 1950s, sulfuric acid attacks were a recurring theme in Japanese sensationalist media. Often termed "crimes of passion" (jōchi jiken), they were sensationalized as the ultimate expression of "festered" (tareda) love triangles.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text likely comes from a *kasutori* magazine—cheap, sensationalist publications that flourished after the war. They focused on "3S" (Sex, Screen, Sports) but also featured "true crime" and stories of moral decay, reflecting the social instability of the time.
*   **Geographic References:** "Hanshin Mikage Station" (in Kobe) and "Nishinomiya" are real locations in the Hyogo prefecture, lending a sense of "true story" realism to the narrative.
*   **Social Morality:** The text emphasizes the "purity" of the witness (a 20-year-old virgin) as a contrast to the "ugly" and "complex" sexual relationships of the adults, reflecting the era's preoccupation with lost innocence in a ruined landscape.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **情痴 (Jōchi):** A term for blind, obsessive, or carnal love. It often implies a relationship that has become toxic or socially unacceptable.
*   **内祝 (Uchi-iwai):** Traditionally a gift given to celebrate a happy occasion within a private circle. Here, it’s used as a cover story for the illicit lovers' secret house-hunting.
*   **米搗場 (Kometsukiba):** A place for pounding rice. In the top story, this setting provides a rhythmic, mechanical backdrop to the character's internal psychological turmoil and wartime trauma.
*   **処女 (Shojo):** Virgin. In mid-century pulp literature, this was frequently used as a character archetype to emphasize the shock or "corruption" encountered when the character learns about the adult world.
*   **ぬうと (Nuu-to):** An onomatopoeic expression for appearing suddenly or looming out of the darkness.
*   **硫酸 (Ryūsan):** Sulfuric acid. A common weapon in "revenge" stories of this period.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Trauma and Repetition:** The top story links manual labor (rice pounding) with sexual obsession and battlefield trauma (artillery flashes). The mechanical repetition suggests a psychological state of PTSD.
*   **The "Innocent Bystander":** In the bottom story, Hanako represents the reader—an "innocent" who is dragged into a dark world she doesn't understand. Her realization that she was an "unwitting spy" adds a layer of guilt to her trauma.
*   **Jealousy and Possession:** The antagonist, Sakagami, views his lover as property to be destroyed rather than lost to another. This "all or nothing" mentality is a staple of the *jōchi* genre.
*   **Urban Danger:** The use of cars and trains (Mikage Station) highlights the modern, urban setting where danger lurks in the shadows of the "new" Japan.
