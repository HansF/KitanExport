僕は最近とみに変装の愉しみが分るやうになつてゐる。
それは単なる変装ではなく、男が女になつた場合だけ
の特殊な悦楽だ。特に僕の場合はそれが僕の性的な
興奮を呼びおこすのだつた。
それはどんなといふに、僕が女装して街頭を歩く時、
他の男達が僕を完全に女だと信じ込み、僕の体の或
る部分を無遠慮に視たり、またはチラチラと見てゐるの
を感じた時なのだ。
そして又、もし誰かが僕に声をかけたとして、その男
が僕の女体（！）を本気で抱かんと、或は、僕をいぢめん
と近よつてきた時、
僕はその男に、はつきりと男だといふことを告げるの
だつた。
その時の男の驚きと落胆は僕の最大の性的満足であ
つた。
或日、夜の銀座。僕は人混みの中をすつかり女になり
きつて歩いてゐた。
その夜も二人組の男が、僕の豊満な（！）胸とヒツプ
とを狙つてか、僕の後にピツタリくつついた。
そして、或る暗い街角で僕に、
「お嬢さん、少しいいかね？」
と声をかけた。

## Literal English Translation

P. 111

Lately, I have come to understand the pleasure of disguise, suddenly and intensely.
That is not merely disguise, but a special ecstasy
that only occurs when a man becomes a woman. Especially in my case, that
is what would call forth my sexual
excitement.
What kind is it, you ask? It is when I walk the streets cross-dressed,
and when I feel that other men completely believe I am a woman,
and they stare impertinently at certain parts of my body,
or are watching me furtively.
And furthermore, if someone were to call out to me, and that man
came closer, in earnest attempting to embrace my female body (!), or attempting to tease/torment me,
I would clearly tell that man that I was a man.
The surprise and disappointment of that man at that moment was my greatest sexual satisfaction.
One day, in nighttime Ginza. I was walking through the crowd, having completely become a woman.
That night too, a pair of men, perhaps targeting my voluptuous (!) chest and hips,
stuck tightly behind me.
And, on a certain dark street corner, they called out to me,
"Miss, may we talk to you for a moment?"

## Literary English Translation

P. 111

Recently, I have rapidly become aware of the intense pleasure of disguise.
This is not mere role-play, but a specific ecstasy
reserved solely for when a man transforms into a woman. For me, specifically, this act
is what brings about my sexual arousal.
What kind of thrill is it? It happens when I walk the city streets in drag,
and I sense that other men genuinely believe I am a woman,
staring insolently at specific parts of my body,
or perhaps casting furtive, lingering glances.
Furthermore, if one of these men were to speak to me, approaching with the serious intention
of embracing my "female body" (!) or attempting to harass me,
I would then tell him, quite plainly, that I am a man.
The shock and dashed hopes of that man in that instant constituted my greatest sexual satisfaction.
One evening, in Ginza at night. I was moving through the crowds, entirely committed to my feminine identity.
That night as well, a pair of men, perhaps drawn by my "voluptuous" (!) breasts and hips,
followed close behind me.
Then, on a dark street corner, they propositioned me:
"Miss, do you have a moment?"

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis / Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Section Type** | Confessional Letter, Reader Submission, or "Bizarre Experience Report" (奇譚体験報告). This falls under the popular non-fiction/pseudo-reportage sections characteristic of *Kitan Club*. |
| **Narrator Voice** | First-person male ("僕," *boku*). The tone is clinical, yet sensational, describing a specific sexual fetish (cross-dressing/deception) and the psychological mechanism behind the arousal. |
| **Author Attribution** | Explicitly anonymous, implied reader/contributor. (Commonly signed with a pseudonym, name and location, or left anonymous for sensitive topics.) |
| **Editorial Intervention** | High. The use of exclamation marks in parentheses (e.g., 女体（！）, 豊満な（！）) emphasizes the sensational or taboo aspects of the specific anatomical features being discussed, acting as a literary wink from the editor to the reader. |
| **Target Audience** | Men interested in sexual deviance, fetishism (especially transvestism), power dynamics, and urban transgression. The language assumes familiarity with the psychological mechanisms of sexual satisfaction derived from deception. |
| **Positioning** | Likely placed among other short, scandalous "real-life" accounts, providing variety between longer fiction pieces. P. 111 suggests it is deep into the back half of the magazine. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Era Context (Mid-Showa):** Post-WWII Japan saw an explosion in pulp magazines like *Kitan Club* (established early 1950s) that openly discussed sexual fetishes, psychological deviance, and urban crime, reflecting a societal shift away from wartime restrictions and into a period of consumer culture and sexual exploration (albeit often filtered through male-centric lenses).
*   **Ginza (夜の銀座):** Ginza is a major commercial and entertainment district in Tokyo, symbolizing urban modernity, sophistication, and anonymity. It is historically a prime location for nightlife, prostitution, and public cruising, making it the ideal setting for this kind of transgressive performance.
*   **Josō (女装, Cross-Dressing):** While cross-dressing existed in Japanese theatre (Kabuki *onnagata*), its presentation here is purely as a sexual fetish (transvestism) linked directly to personal "sexual satisfaction" (*seitekiteki manzoku*). This reflects the growing clinical categorization of sexual behaviors in the mid-century.
*   **The Power Dynamic (The Reveal):** The narrative’s unique feature is that the climax is *not* physical sex, but the psychological dominance gained by revealing the truth. The narrator actively seeks to elicit desire in straight men and then frustrates/humiliates them by exposing their desire as "misplaced." This act of reversal grants the narrator "greatest sexual satisfaction," framing the act as a performance of control and social transgression rather than merely a sexual release.
*   **Historical Kana Usage:** The consistent use of historical kana (*rekishiteki kanazukai*)—e.g., やう (yō), てゐる (teiru), のだつた (nodatta)—is typical of literary and magazine publications well into the 1950s and sometimes 60s, despite the formal orthographic reforms post-WWII.

## Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

| Term | Reading | Primary Meaning | Contextual/Euphemistic Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **変装** | へんそう (hensō) | Disguise | Cross-dressing; Transvestism (specifically here, male-to-female). |
| **悦楽** | えつらく (etsuraku) | Pleasure, Joy, Delight | Ecstasy; often implies sensual or sexual rapture. |
| **性的満足** | せいてきまんぞく (seiteki manzoku) | Sexual satisfaction | Climax; often implies psychological rather than purely physiological release in this context. |
| **女体** | じょたい (jotai) | Female body | Highly charged, fetishistic term for the female form (emphasized by the (!)). |
| **抱かんと** | だかんと (dakanto) | Attempting to embrace | Attempting to initiate sexual contact/intercourse (Archaic volitional form). |
| **いぢめんと** | いじめんと (ijimento) | Attempting to tease/torment | Attempting to sexually harass or proposition aggressively. |
| **豊満な** | ほうまんな (hōmanna) | Voluptuous, full, ample | Specific reference to desirable female secondary sexual characteristics (breasts/hips), emphasized by the (!). |
| **とみに** | とみに (tomi ni) | Suddenly, rapidly | Quickly, intensely. |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

*   **Dominant Themes:** Deception, Voyeurism, Psychological Control, Gender Performance, Power Reversal.
*   **Implicit Fantasy:** The fantasy centers on occupying a liminal, highly desirable sexual space (the object of straight male desire) while maintaining ultimate cognitive control. The narrator is the puppet master, engineering the entire interaction.
*   **Ero-Guro Tropes:** This text embodies the classic *Ero-Guro* interest in transgression and the grotesque fusion of gender roles and sexual psychology. The "grotesque" element is the shock and disappointment experienced by the deceived men—a psychological violence inflicted by the narrator.
*   **The Crux of Arousal:** The arousal is intellectual and manipulative, not passive. It stems from the realization that one can induce profound sexual desire in others purely through manufactured appearance (the disguise) and then negate that desire at will, demonstrating the fragility of heterosexual attraction focused solely on surface appearances.

## Content Classification Tags

*   Sexual content: Moderate (Detailed discussion of fetishism, arousal, physical features, and attempted solicitation).
*   Violence: Psychological (Intentional humiliation and disappointment as a source of sexual satisfaction).
*   Coercion: Implicit (The men are attempting coercion/street harassment; the narrator is coercing their emotional response).
*   Medical / Bodily Themes: Gender transformation (cross-dressing).
*   Taboo or illegal implications: Public solicitation/cruising in connection with disguise.
