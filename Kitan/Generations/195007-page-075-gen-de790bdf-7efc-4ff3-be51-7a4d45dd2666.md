## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Sorrowful Tale of the Flower and Willow World: The Female Beggar of Imazato Shinchi**
**by Yasuko Oka**

In a dim two-tatami room, [with] black hair without kinks rare for people of these days, [with head] turned down, O-sato today also was diligently combing. "Suuu"—the teeth of the comb pass through and [the hair] shines like lacquer. Forever and forever, without getting tired, she was combing. On the cheeks that look pale and translucent, the nape of the neck suggests a classic beauty of ill-fortune.
"What a creepy sister, messing with long hair like a ghost all day long, we can't stand it."
"Truly a disagreeable child, she's such an eyesore it's unbearable."
The mother also chimed in, and as if truly fed up, knitted her brows. No matter what was said, with an unconcerned face, O-sato still was combing her hair.
A slender face with thin eyebrows, a straight bridge of the nose, a small mouth; though haggard, it is a somewhat unusually well-formed set of features, and is completely different from the coarse-featured, audacious-looking face of her younger sister. It also does not resemble the mother's harsh eyes and vulgar mouth. With a father who is a drinker, a gambler, and a lazy person, and this mother lacking in affection as parents, O-sato was an unfortunate woman.
O-sato, immediately after being born, was sent away as a foster child. The lazy father and mother did not have the wherewithal to raise a child.
O-sato was beautiful from the time she was a child, her nature was also gentle, and the foster parents loved her more than their own child; it would have been her happiness if the cold-hearted biological parents had never appeared, and then she would not have had to end up with a wretched illness like the current one—.
At the age of seven, she was taken back by her biological parents. Were even yakuza-like parents pulled by parental affection? Not at all. They are not such admirable humans. Below her, two younger sisters were born, and if O-sato is there, she will probably do the babysitting, she will probably also be able to do the errands—such was their appalling intention.
Without paying even the child-rearing expenses, they went to take back O-sato, who had been raised [by others], using parental authority. Of course, she was afraid of the parents who appeared unexpectedly and clung to the foster parents and cried. The foster parents also entreated, "Please do not take her," but at the rare beauty of their own child seen for the first time, despite being a child, the greed that "when she grows up she will make us earn a lot" also came out, and they insisted on taking her by force.
"For seven years without any news, not even caring for her, to come and take her home now, can there be such a terrible person?"
From the foster parents who wailed so, as if snatching her away, they took her and the struggling girl. When getting on the train, despite being young, she grabbed the door with all her might and refused to enter, but with the rough power of adults, she was pushed inside. Leaning out from the window of the running train, she shouted at the limit of her voice, "Father! Mother!" but the train went farther and farther away from the land of the nostalgic foster parents.
The biological parents' house she was taken to was a poor alley in a narrow back tenement, and the inside of the house was messily cluttered like a storage room, and the two younger sisters of four and one years old cried "pee-pee" ill-temperedly and often.
The foster parents' spacious country house in Yamato, the rich dining table, the caresses of the older brothers and sisters—these became a dream of the distant past; O-sato, while watching everyone's faces [moods], became a child of few words.
"She is like a crane that landed in a garbage heap."
"Is that really their child?"
The neighborhood people rumored so. Even while being made to do only babysitting and errands, O-sato grew into a daughter who became more beautiful day by day, quiet and kind. Even though it was the Kida family, who were a bunch of yakuza shunned by people, there was no one who spoke ill of her, and there was no one who did not feel pity for O-sato, who had such worthless parents and sisters.

**Tragedies of the Pleasure Quarters: The Female Beggar of Imazato Shinchi**
**By Yasuko Oka**

In a dimly lit two-tatami room, O-sato sat with her head bowed, diligently combing her hair—straight, black, and remarkably smooth for a woman of these times. With a soft *swish*, the teeth of the comb glided through, leaving a lacquer-like luster in their wake. She combed incessantly, as if she would never tire of the task. Her pale, translucent cheeks and the curve of her neck evoked the tragic grace of a classic beauty from a bygone era.

"She’s a creepy one, isn’t she?" one of her sisters remarked. "Mucking about with that long hair all day like some ghost. We can’t stand it."

"Truly a wretched child," the mother agreed, knitting her brows in a look of profound annoyance. "A complete eyesore."

O-sato remained unmoved by their scorn, continuing to comb her hair with a stoic, detached expression. Her face was slender with delicate brows, a straight nose, and a small, refined mouth. Though she was worn thin, her features possessed a rare elegance that stood in stark contrast to the coarse, insolent looks of her younger sisters. She bore no resemblance to her mother’s harsh eyes or vulgar mouth. Born to a drunken, gambling, shiftless father and a cold-hearted mother, O-sato was a woman marked by misfortune.

Shortly after her birth, O-sato had been sent away to foster parents. Her lazy biological parents simply lacked the will or the means to raise her. She grew into a beautiful, gentle child, and her foster parents loved her even more than their own flesh and blood. It would have been her greatest blessing if her cold biological parents had never reappeared; perhaps then she might have avoided the wretched illness that now plagued her.

When she was seven, her biological parents came to claim her. Was it out of a sudden surge of parental love? Hardly. They were not such noble creatures. Having had two more daughters, they simply decided that if O-sato were around, she could serve as a babysitter and an errand girl. It was an appalling, calculated motive.

Despite never having paid a cent for her upbringing, they used their legal parental authority to take her back. Terrified by these strangers who claimed to be her parents, O-sato clung to her foster parents and sobbed. Her foster parents begged them to leave her, but seeing the child’s remarkable beauty for the first time, the biological parents were gripped by greed. *When she grows up,* they thought, *she will make us a fortune.* They insisted on taking her by force.

"You haven't sent a word in seven years! You never cared for her!" the foster mother wailed. "How can you be so cruel as to take her back now?"

They practically snatched her away. At the station, the young O-sato gripped the train door with all her strength, refusing to board, but she was shoved inside by the brute force of the adults. Leaning out of the window as the train began to move, she screamed "Father! Mother!" until her voice failed, watching as the beloved home of her foster parents vanished into the distance.

The home she was brought to was a cramped, squalid tenement in a back alley. The rooms were as cluttered as a junk shop, and her two younger sisters—aged four and one—were ill-tempered children who spent their days wailing. Her life in the spacious country house in Yamato, the bountiful meals, and the affection of her foster siblings became nothing more than a fading dream. O-sato became a withdrawn child, constantly walking on eggshells around her family.

"She’s like a crane in a garbage heap," the neighbors whispered. "Is she really their daughter?"

Despite being burdened with endless chores and babysitting, O-sato grew more beautiful, quiet, and kind with each passing day. Even though the Kida family were a pack of yakuza loathed by everyone in the neighborhood, no one had a bad word to say about her. There was not a soul who did not pity O-sato for being cursed with such a worthless family.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The text follows a standard pre-modern/mid-century Japanese magazine layout. It is written in vertical columns (*tategaki*) that wrap around a central illustration.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is prominent on the right side, followed by the author's name. A recurring header at the top of the page, "花柳界哀話" (Sorrowful Tales of the Geisha World), indicates that this is part of a regular column or series.
*   **Illustration:** The central artwork depicts a woman in a kimono looking into a hand mirror, emphasizing the themes of beauty and self-reflection amidst sorrow. The style is reminiscent of early 20th-century *bijin-ga* (pictures of beautiful women) but with a darker, more realistic tone typical of social realist fiction from the 1940s-50s.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of older and newer orthographic conventions. It uses large 「つ」 instead of the small geminate 「っ」 (e.g., なかつた) and archaic kanji like 「氣」 in some dialogue, though the main narrative often uses more modern forms. This suggests a publication from the transition period (roughly 1946–1955).
*   **Page Number:** The "76" at the bottom right indicates its placement within a larger publication.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Imazato Shinchi (今里新地):** This was a well-known red-light district in Osaka. Established in the late Taisho era, it was a "New Ground" (*Shinchi*) for entertainment and prostitution. The story's title immediately signals to the reader a setting of vice, poverty, and tragedy.
*   **Karyūkai (花柳界):** Literally "The World of Flowers and Willows," a euphemism for the world of geisha and licensed prostitution. Stories categorized as *Karyū Aiwah* (Sorrowful Tales of the Karyūkai) were a popular genre of melodrama that focused on the tragic lives of women in this demimonde.
*   **Satogo (里子):** The practice of sending children to be raised by foster parents in the countryside was common among the urban poor in Japan. Often, these children were treated well by foster families but were seen as "commodities" or "labor" by their biological parents, who might reclaim them once they were old enough to work or be sold into the sex trade.
*   **Yamato (大和):** Refers to the Nara region, often portrayed in literature as a place of traditional, wholesome country life, contrasting with the "poisonous" atmosphere of the city tenements.
*   **Post-war Poverty:** The description of the "narrow back tenement" (*ura-nagaya*) and the "poor alley" (*binbou-roji*) reflects the harsh living conditions of the Japanese urban underclass during and after WWII.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **甲斐性 (Kaishō):** Resourcefulness, specifically the ability to support a family or "make something of oneself." The parents' lack of *kaishō* is their defining moral failure.
*   **慈けのこの母 (Shige no kono haha?):** This likely refers to 「情けのない」 (nasake no nai - heartless/unfeeling), written with a specific character choice or perhaps a regional variation/typo for 「慈しみのない」. It emphasizes the mother's lack of maternal instinct.
*   **掃きだめに鶴 (Hakidame ni tsuru):** "A crane in a garbage heap." A common Japanese idiom for a person of exceptional beauty or talent found in a lowly or squalid environment.
*   **殊勝 (Shushō):** Admirable, commendable. Used sarcastically here to describe the parents.
*   **音信不通 (Onshin futsū):** No news, no contact. Highlighting the seven-year abandonment.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Nature vs. Nurture:** O-sato is naturally beautiful and "noble" (the crane), while her parents and sisters are coarse and "vulgar" (the garbage heap). Despite her environment, her inherent goodness shines through, making her plight more tragic.
*   **Greed and Exploitation:** The parents reclaim O-sato not out of love, but because they recognize her market value. Her beauty is a curse that leads her back into a life of servitude and, as hinted by the term "illness" and the setting of Imazato Shinchi, eventually prostitution and destitution.
*   **The Loss of Innocence:** The train ride represents a traumatic threshold, severing the girl from the "dream" of her happy childhood in Yamato and dragging her into the "nightmare" of the urban slums.
*   **Fatalism:** The term "ill-fated" (*hakkō*) and the overall tone suggest that O-sato is a victim of a destiny she cannot escape, a common trope in *Karyūkai* literature.
