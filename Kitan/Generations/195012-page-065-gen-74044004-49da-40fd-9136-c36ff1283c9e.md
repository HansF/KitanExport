「ああッ！お父さんだ、お父さんッ！」
信二は、十年ぶりで始めて會つたかのように、懐しさを、嬉しさを、震えつきながら、乳を求める幼児のように、両手を高くあげて、一散に駆け出した涙が、朝霧のように頬を傅つて飛び散った。
光子も、さつと、立上り、信二の後を、追っかけた。
二人の、姿が、衣服が、朝風になびいて、ひら＼／と、ひらめいた。
「おぉッ！　信二ッ！　信二ッ！　生きていたかッ！」
父は、白髪まじりの髪を、乱し、呼喚を乱し、とぎれ＼／に、嬉しそうに叫んで近付いてきた。
「お、お父さんッ！」
信二は、子供のように、胸元へ、しがみついて、おい＼／と顔をあげて泣いた。
「心配したぞッ、おまえは、人殺しをしたと思つて、きつと、自殺すると思い、大急ぎで駆けてきたんだ」
父は、息子の、いたづら盛りの頃を思い出して、優しく、みつめ、そろいって、微笑した。瞼が真っ赤であつた。
光子は、肩であえぎ、大きな瞳を、ぱつちり開けて、信二の、父の、上品な老顔を、じつとみつめ、泣きながら立ちつくしていた。
「ああ——よかった、じつはな、信二おまえが殺したと思つた男は、近所のならず者でひどい奴だつたんぢゃよ光子さんの、お父さんの名前をかたつて、満枝を——満枝も、危く、間違いを起こすところだつたといつとつた——もういいよ、俺は許そう、俺にも責任があるんだ——それに、満枝も、後悔しとるらしいから——」
「ぢや、お父さん、あの男は死んだんぢゃないんですか？」
「あんな男、殺しても死ぬような奴ぢやないんだ、今頃、前科何犯というお尋ね者なんだ、今頃前科何犯というお尋ね者なんだ、今頃当置場で唸つてゐるだろう」
光子が、おづ＼／と、でも、嬉しそうに、
「あの——あたしの、お父さんは——」
「あ、大倉さんのお嬢さんでしょう、お父さんは、よく、碁会所で会いますよ、昨夜も途中で会いましたが、今夜は面白い相手で、夜通しになるかも知れんと、如何にも、うれしそうに行きましたよ。今頃は何も知らずに、パチ＼／やつていらつしやるでしょうよ。」
「まあ——困つたものね、お父さんにはそれに、お父さんが、殺されたと聞いて、気も転倒して、信二につれられて、こんな処へ、」
「いや承知して、いますよ、信二との約束事も、もう心配せんでもよろしい。私の方から御願いしますよハハハ」
光子は顔、赫らめて、信二を見る。
笑声は、晴れやかに笑った。三人の笑声は、朝風を縫って、湖面に響き渡つた。

**Hundred Strange Tales**
**Sighs of the City**
**By Jugorō**

"Ah! It is Father, Father!"
Shinji, as if meeting for the first time in ten years, with nostalgia and happiness, while trembling, like an infant seeking milk, raised both hands high and ran at full speed. Tears, like morning mist, along his cheeks flowed and scattered.
Mitsuko also, quickly, stood up and after Shinji, chased.
The two's, figures, clothes, in the morning wind fluttered, flutter-flutter, and shimmered.
"Oh! Shinji! Shinji! Were you alive?!"
The father, white-hair-mixed hair disheveled, breath disheveled, brokenly, happily shouting approached.
"O-Father!"
Shinji, like a child, to the chest, clung, and "oi-oi" raising his face cried.
"I worried! You, thinking you committed a murder, surely, thinking you would commit suicide, in a great hurry I ran here."
The father, remembering his son's mischievous prime days, gently, gazed, and smiled. Eyelids were bright red.
Mitsuko, with shoulders panting, big eyes wide open, at Shinji's father's elegant old face fixedly gazed, and while crying stood still.
"Ah—it was good. Actually, Shinji, the man you thought you killed was a neighborhood scoundrel and a terrible fellow. Pretending to be Mitsuko-san's father's name, Mitsue—Mitsue too, narrowly, was about to make a mistake, she said—It's fine now, I shall forgive. I too have responsibility—Besides, Mitsue also seems to be regretting—"
"Then, Father, that man did not die?"
"That kind of man, even if killed is not the type to die. Right now, he is a wanted man with many prior convictions, right now in the detention cell he must be groaning."
Mitsuko, hesitantly, but, happily,
"Um—my father is—"
"Ah, you must be Okura-san's daughter. Your father, often at the Go club I meet. Last night too on the way I met, but tonight with an interesting opponent, it might be all night he said, and very happily went. By now, knowing nothing, 'pachi-pachi' [sound of Go stones] he must be doing."
"Oh—a troubled person he is, my father. Besides, hearing Father was killed, my mind turned upside down, and taken by Shinji, to this kind of place..."
"No, I am aware. The promise with Shinji too, no need to worry anymore. From my side I ask of you, Hahaha."
Mitsuko face reddened, looks at Shinji.
The laughter, brightly laughed. The three's laughter, the morning wind sewing through, on the lake surface echoed and spread.

**Sixty Words: More than Lady Chatterley's Lover**
**A Certain Company Employee's Story**
"What. It is nothing much, isn't it?"
The "Lady Chatterley's Lover" I finally got my hands on,
"It is interesting, so try reading it—"
as a result of lending it to her, I wondered what kind of face she would make, and it was this.
"Then how about this. It will definitely be useful in the future."
So, somewhat disgruntled, Van de Velde's "Ideal Marriage" to read I recommended.
"Only common things are written. Not different at all from women's magazines, is it?"
dissatisfiedly she muttered. Hmm, correct answer—. Indeed common things they are without doubt, but those common things, man—shame.

**Strange Tales: A Hundred Stories**
**Sighs of the City**
**By Jugorō**

"Ah! It’s Father! Father!"
As if reuniting after a decade, Shinji was overcome with a trembling mix of nostalgia and joy. Like an infant reaching for its mother, he threw his arms wide and sprinted toward him, tears scattering from his cheeks like morning mist. Mitsuko sprang up and chased after him. Their silhouettes and clothes fluttered and danced in the morning breeze.
"Oh! Shinji! Shinji! You're alive!" 
His father approached, his graying hair wild and his breath ragged, crying out with broken sobs of happiness. 
"Father!" 
Shinji clung to his father’s chest like a small child, weeping uncontrollably. 
"I was so worried," the father said, looking tenderly at his son as if he were still a mischievous boy, a gentle smile breaking through his tear-reddened eyes. "I thought you’d killed a man and would surely take your own life in despair. I came as fast as I could."
Mitsuko stood by, breathless, her eyes wide as she gazed at the refined, aged face of Shinji’s father, tears streaming down her face. 
"It’s all right now," the father continued. "Actually, Shinji, that man you thought you killed was nothing but a local thug, a real piece of work. He’d been using Mitsuko’s father’s name to deceive Mitsue—and Mitsue told me she nearly made a terrible mistake because of him. Let's put it behind us. I forgive you; I take some of the blame myself. Besides, it seems Mitsue is truly repentant."
"Then... Father, that man isn't dead?"
"A man like that doesn't die just because you try to kill him! He’s a wanted criminal with a long rap sheet. Right now, he’s likely groaning in a jail cell."
Mitsuko spoke up hesitantly, yet with a glimmer of hope. "Um... and my father?"
"Ah, you must be Mr. Okura’s daughter. I see him often at the Go club. I ran into him last night, and he was heading off in high spirits, saying he had a challenging opponent and might play through the night. He's likely sitting there right now, clicking his Go stones, completely unaware of all this drama."
"Oh, honestly... my father is hopeless," Mitsuko sighed. "When I heard he’d been killed, I lost my head and let Shinji bring me all the way out here."
"Don't worry, I understand everything," the father laughed. "As for your engagement to Shinji, you have my full blessing. In fact, I’m the one who should be asking you! Hahaha!"
Mitsuko blushed and stole a glance at Shinji. Their bright laughter rang out, carrying across the morning wind and echoing over the surface of the lake.

**Sixty-Word Stories: Beyond Lady Chatterley's Lover**
**A Salaryman's Tale**
"Is that it? It’s not such a big deal, is it?"
I had finally managed to get a copy of *Lady Chatterley’s Lover*. I lent it to my girlfriend, telling her, "It’s fascinating—give it a read," curious to see her reaction. This was it.
Feeling a bit miffed, I tried another approach. "Well then, how about this? It’ll definitely be useful for our future." I suggested she read Van de Velde’s *Ideal Marriage*.
"It just says the most obvious things," she muttered, looking unimpressed. "It’s no different from what’s in the women’s magazines."
Hmph. She’s right, of course. They *are* obvious things. But it’s those very "obvious" things that make a man... well, blush with shame.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The page is a classic example of a "B5" size magazine layout common in the post-war era. It uses vertical text (tategaki) read from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The main title "奇譚百話" (Kitan Hyakua) and "都会の溜息" (Tokai no Tameiki) are set in a stylized, bold, handwritten-style font that suggests mystery or melodrama.
*   **Illustration:** A small line-art illustration shows a man and a woman in profile. The man looks somewhat distressed or intense, while the woman looks slightly away, consistent with the melodramatic tone of the stories.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page is divided into two main sections. The top 2/3 is a complete narrative with dialogue. The bottom 1/3 contains smaller, "micro-fiction" or essay-like snippets under the heading "Sixty Words" (六十語).
*   **Punctuation:** It uses repetitive iteration marks like "＼／" for "hira-hira" (fluttering) or "tokire-tokire" (brokenly), which was standard in mid-century printing. It also uses exclamation points combined with "tsu" (ッ) to emphasize shouting.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Early 1950s):** The content and orthography point to the early 1950s. The mention of *Lady Chatterley's Lover* is a major chronological marker.
*   **The Chatterley Trial (1951-1957):** In 1950, a full translation of D.H. Lawrence's *Lady Chatterley's Lover* was published in Japan, leading to a famous obscenity trial. It was a "forbidden fruit" for many readers of the time, which explains why the character in the second story "finally got his hands on it" to impress his girlfriend.
*   **The Van de Velde Reference:** *The Ideal Marriage* (1926) by Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde was a famous sex manual that became a bestseller in Japan (known as *Kanzennaru Kekkon*). It was considered "educational" rather than "obscene," hence the girlfriend's comparison to mundane women's magazines.
*   **Go Clubs (Go-kaisho):** The father being at a Go club all night reflects a common social pastime for older men in the Showa era.
*   **Post-war Melodrama:** The main story features tropes common in *kasutori* magazines: mistaken identity, a "scoundrel" (narezumono), a presumed murder, and a dramatic lakeside reunion. These magazines were known for being cheap, sensational, and focusing on "the sighs of the city"—the struggles of urban life after the war.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **一散に (Issan-ni):** At full speed; headlong.
*   **傅つて (Tsutatte):** Along; following a path (modern: 伝って).
*   **呼喚 (Kokan):** Breath; breathing (specifically the rhythm of breathing while speaking or crying).
*   **ならず者 (Narazumono):** A scoundrel, rogue, or hoodlum.
*   **お尋ね者 (Otazunemono):** A wanted person; a fugitive.
*   **憮然 (Buzen):** Discouraged, disgruntled, or surprised into silence.
*   **慙 (Hajiru/Zan):** To feel ashamed. The text ends abruptly on this kanji to create a "witty" punchline.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Redemption and Reconciliation:** The main story focuses on the relief of finding out a loved one is not a criminal. It emphasizes paternal forgiveness and the clearing of misunderstandings.
*   **The "Modern Woman" vs. The "Romantic Man":** In the second story, there is a subtextual joke about gender roles. The man tries to use "erotic" or "scientific" literature to provoke a reaction or educate his partner, but the woman is pragmatic and unimpressed, finding the "secrets" of sex to be "obvious" things she's already read in domestic magazines.
*   **Urban Sophistication:** The title "Sighs of the City" suggests a bittersweet look at modern life. The stories juxtapose heavy drama (murder/suicide threats) with mundane realities (playing Go/reading magazines).
