「ハシム、這入れ」
ドラがいったので、アリーのうしろ
で、もぢ／＼していたハシムは、仕方な
しに、秀でた眉をしかめながら、のつそ
り這入つてきた。
　と、ジョホーラの美しい顔が、ボー
ツと紅くなつたのである。
「ハシム、そこへかけろ」
「はい、トアン」
　ハシムが、憂鬱な顔をして掛けると
急にジョホーラが立上つて、大慌てに
顔をかくして化粧室へ逃げこんだ。
「おお！　ジョホーラ」
ドラは立上つて呼びとめた。が、ふ
と、何かに思い当つた風に
「ふふ、惚れてやがるな」
つぶやいて、また、椅子にかけた。
「ハシム、おめえの指輪つてのは、こ
れか？」
ハシムは、覗きこんで
「あッ！　こ、これです、ど、どこに
ありました？」
「ジョホーラが盗んだといってるんだ
が」
「へえ？　妙だなあ、トアン、じつ
は、この指輪、ジョホーラにやろうと
思つていたんですよぜ」
「ど、どうしてだ」
「こうなんです、まあ聞いて下さい、
たしか、一週間ほどまえでした。仕立
屋のエカンのおかみさんが、夜中、わ
たしんとこへやつてきて、いうことを
聞いてくれつてせがむんです。いやだ
というと、指輪をやるからと、それを
差し出すんです。で、わたしは、ちょ
うど金につまつていましたから、つい
承諾しましたんで。」
「ふうむ、ぢや、この指輪はエカンの
女房のか？　てへッ、ややこしくなつ
てきた――」
「しかし、どうしてジョホーラの手に
入つたんでしよう？　ひょつとすると
アラ！のおひき合わせかな？」
「そうかも知れねえよ、ハシムそれに
おめえは分らねえだろうが、ジョホー
ラは、おめえに惚れてるらしいぞ」
「ええッ？　そ、そんな馬鹿な」
ドラは、愉快そうに、カラカラと笑
つた。
「おおいッ！　ジョホーラ、おめえの
チンタ（愛人）がきてるのにどうし
てるんだよ」
すると、化粧室のドアがさつと開か
れて、眼のさめるようなグリーンのド
レスに着替えて花かんざしをさしたジ
ョホーラが上氣した顔で、キッと唇を
噛みしめ、狂つた女神のように駈けて
くると
「ハシム！　ハシム！」
叫びながら、ガバ、とハシムの首つ
玉にかじりついた。息をはずませて
「あたしは、あの女が帰るところを
みて、腹だちまぎれに、おまえの指輪
を盗んだんだよ、きつと、あの女に貰
つたと思つて、カンニして、ハシム、
もう、誰にも、渡さない、あたしの、
可愛いハシム、うわあん」
泣き叫びながらジョホーラは、ハシ
ムの唇や、頬つぺたや、頸筋に、荒つ
ぽい涙と接吻の雨を降らせた。
で、顔一面、涙で、こすり廻されにハ
シムは、すつかりのぼせ上つて、涙に
ぬれた眼をパチパチやつていた。
「やれやれ、こりやたまらんわ――ア
リー、退散だ、おまえも早くかえつて
バブにくっついてこい」
ポンとアリーの肩を叩いてドラは、
早々、ガニ股で、肩をいからせながら、
のつしのつしと砂浜を蹈みしめて去つ
ていつた。

　　　四

女好きと、なまけ者で有名な仕立屋
のエカンが、今日は珍らしく、切り屑
だらけになりながら忙しそうに手ミシ
ンを使つていた。
傍で、三月まえ、やつさもつさで貰
つた妻君が、ボタンつけをしながら、
めそめそ泣いている。どうも、いつも
の大乱闘が納まつた直後らしい。
「チエツ、くそいまいましい、一日や
二日家をあけたつてどうだつてんだ」
至つて気はいいんだが、むかつ腹だ
てのエカンは、まだプリプリしている
「よおつ、エカン、精が出るなあ」
ポリシーのドラがやつてきた。
「いよおつ！　トアン・ドラ！　これ
あ――どうしていたんです？　さあ

「ハシム、入れ」
ドラが言ったので、アリーの後ろでもじもじしていたハシムは、仕方なしに、秀でた眉をしかめながら、のっそり入ってきた。
　と、ジョホーラの美しい顔が、ボーッと赤くなったのである。
「ハシム、そこへかけろ」
「はい、トアン」
　ハシムが、憂鬱な顔をして腰掛けると、急にジョホーラが立ち上がって、大慌てに顔を隠して化粧室へ逃げ込んだ。
「おお！ ジョホーラ」
ドラは立ち上がって呼び止めた。が、ふと、何かに思い当たった風に
「ふふ、惚れてやがるな」
つぶやいて、また、椅子にかけた。
「ハシム、お前の指輪っていうのは、これか？」
ハシムは、覗き込んで
「あっ！ こ、これです、ど、どこにありました？」
「ジョホーラが盗んだと言っているんだが」
「へえ？ 妙だなあ、トアン、実は、この指輪、ジョホーラにやろうと思っていたんですよ」
「ど、どうしてだ」
「こうなんです、まあ聞いてください。確か一週間ほど前でした。仕立屋のエカンのおかみさんが、夜中、私のところへやってきて、言うことを聞いてくれとせがむんです。嫌だと言うと、指輪をやるからと、それを差し出すんです。で、私はちょうど金に詰まっていましたから、つい承諾しましたんで。」
「ふむ、じゃあ、この指輪はエカンの女房のか？ てへっ、ややこしくなってきた――」
「しかし、どうしてジョホーラの手に入ったんでしょう？ ひょっとするとアラーのお引き合わせかな？」
「そうかも知れねえよ、ハシム。それにお前は分からねえだろうが、ジョホーラはお前に惚れてるらしいぞ」
「ええっ？ そ、そんな馬鹿な」
ドラは、愉快そうに、カラカラと笑った。
「おーい！ ジョホーラ、お前のチンタ（愛人）が来てるのにどうしてるんだよ」
すると、化粧室のドアがさっと開かれて、目の覚めるようなグリーンのドレスに着替えて花かんざしを挿したジョホーラが上気した顔で、キッと唇を噛み締め、狂った女神のように駆けてくると
「ハシム！ ハシム！」
叫びながら、ガバッとハシムの首ったまにかじりついた。息をはずませて
「あたしは、あの女が帰るところを見て、腹立ち紛れに、お前の指輪を盗んだんだよ。きっと、あの女に貰ったと思って。勘弁して、ハシム。もう、誰にも渡さない、あたしの可愛いハシム、うわーん」
泣き叫びながらジョホーラは、ハシムの唇や、頬っぺたや、首筋に、荒っぽい涙と接吻の雨を降らせた。
で、顔一面、涙でこすり回され、ハシムはすっかりのぼせ上がって、涙に濡れた目をパチパチやっていた。
「やれやれ、こりゃたまらんわ――アリー、退散だ。お前も早く帰ってバブにくっついて来い」
ポンとアリーの肩を叩いてドラは、早々、ガニ股で肩をいからせながら、のっしのっしと砂浜を踏みしめて去っていった。

傍で、三ヶ月前、やっさもっさで貰った妻君が、ボタン付けをしながら、めそめそ泣いている。どうも、いつもの大乱闘が収まった直後らしい。

至って気はいいんだが、向かっ腹立てのエカンは、まだプリプリしている。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Hashim, enter."
Because Dora said [it], Hashim, who was fidgeting behind Ali, without choice, while scowling [with] prominent eyebrows, sluggishly entered.
Then, Johora's beautiful face, "bo-tto" (vividly) became red.
"Hashim, sit there."
"Yes, Tuan."
When Hashim, doing a melancholy face, sat down, suddenly Johora stood up, in a great panic hiding [her] face, escaped into the dressing room.
"Oh! Johora."
Dora stood up and called out to stop [her]. But, suddenly, in a manner of having realized something,
"Heh heh, [she] is fallen in love [with him], isn't she,"
muttering, [he] again sat in the chair.
"Hashim, your ring thing, is it this?"
Hashim, peeking in,
"Ah! Th-this is it, wh-where was it?"
"I'm saying Johora stole it, but..."
"Eh? Strange, Tuan, actually, this ring, I was thinking to give to Johora."
"Wh-why is that?"
"It is like this, please listen. Certainly, it was about one week ago. The tailor Ekan's wife, in the middle of the night, came to my place, and begged me to listen to what she says. When I said I don't want to, [she said] because I will give a ring, and held it out. So, I, because I was just stuck for money, accidentally consented."
"Hmm, then, this ring is Ekan's wife's? Te-heh, [it] has become complicated—"
"But, why did it enter Johora's hand? By any chance, is it Allah's matching?"
"That might be so, Hashim. Besides, you probably don't understand, but Johora seems to be in love with you."
"Eh? Th-such nonsense."
Dora, in a pleasant way, "kara-kara" (clatteringly/loudly) laughed.
"Hey! Johora, your cinta (lover) has come, so what are you doing?"
Then, the dressing room door "satto" (quickly) was opened, and having changed into an eye-opening green dress and wearing a flower hairpin, Johora with a flushed face, "kitto" (sharply) biting her lip, running like a mad goddess,
"Hashim! Hashim!"
While screaming, "gaba" (forcefully), she clung to Hashim's neck. Panting for breath,
"I, seeing that woman returning, in a fit of anger, stole your ring. Thinking surely you received it from that woman. Forgive me, Hashim. Anymore, to anyone, I won't give [you], my cute Hashim, uwaaan."
While crying and screaming, Johora, on Hashim's lips, cheeks, and neck, rained rough tears and kisses.
So, face entirely rubbed around with tears, Hashim completely became dizzy/flushed, and was doing "pachi-pachi" (blinking) with tear-drenched eyes.
"Good grief, this is unbearable—Ali, retreat. You too, go home quickly and stick to the babu (servant/nanny)."
"Pon" (thumping) hitting Ali's shoulder, Dora, quickly, with bow-legs, squaring his shoulders, "nosshi-nosshi" (heavily) treading the sandy beach, went away.

IV

Famous as a woman-lover and lazy person, the tailor Ekan, today unusually, while becoming full of scraps, was busily using a hand sewing machine.
Nearby, the wife received three months ago after much trouble, while attaching buttons, is sobbing. Apparently, it is just after a usual big brawl settled down.
"Che, damn annoying. Even if I open the house for a day or two, so what."
Essentially good-natured, but the hot-tempered Ekan is still fuming.
"Yo, Ekan, you're working hard."
Policy [man] Dora came.
"Yo! Tuan Dora! This—what have you been doing? Come..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Hashim, get in here," Dora commanded. Hashim, who had been fidgeting behind Ali, reluctantly shuffled into the room, his dark brows knitted in a scowl. At that moment, Johora’s beautiful face flushed a deep, vivid crimson.

"Hashim, take a seat," Dora said.
"Yes, Tuan," Hashim replied gloomily. As he sat down, Johora suddenly bolted upright and, shielding her face in a panic, fled into the dressing room.

"Hey! Johora!" Dora stood to call after her, but then, struck by a sudden realization, he chuckled to himself. "Heh, she’s got it bad for him," he muttered, sinking back into his chair. "Hashim, is this the ring you were talking about?"

Hashim leaned in to look. "Ah! Yes, that’s the one! Wh-where did you find it?"

"Well, Johora says she stole it, but..."

"What? That’s strange, Tuan. To tell you the truth, I was actually planning on giving this ring to Johora myself."

"And why is that?"

"It’s like this—listen. It was about a week ago. The tailor Ekan’s wife came to my place in the middle of the night, practically begging for a favor. I tried to refuse, but she held out this ring and said she’d give it to me if I helped. I was strapped for cash at the time, so I... well, I gave in."

"Hmm. So this ring belongs to Ekan’s wife? Heh, things are getting complicated."

"But how did it end up in Johora’s hands? Do you think it was Allah’s will that brought us together?"

"Maybe so, Hashim. And though you might be too dense to see it, it looks like Johora is head-over-heels for you."

"What? Th-that’s ridiculous!" Hashim stammered. Dora let out a booming, hearty laugh.

"Hey, Johora! Your *cinta*—your lover—is here! What are you hiding for?"

Suddenly, the dressing room door swung open. Johora emerged, radiant in a stunning green dress with a flower tucked into her hair. Her face was flushed with passion. Biting her lip, she ran toward them like a wild goddess.

"Hashim! Hashim!" she cried, throwing herself onto him and clinging to his neck. Gasping for breath, she sobbed, "I saw that woman leaving, and I was so furious that I stole the ring! I was sure she’d given it to you! Please, forgive me, Hashim! I won’t let anyone else have you! You’re mine, my sweet Hashim! Oh, uwaaan!"

Between her wails, Johora showered Hashim’s lips, cheeks, and neck with a torrent of tears and rough kisses. Rubbed raw by her weeping face, Hashim sat there in a daze, his tear-filled eyes blinking in confusion.

"Good grief, I can’t take any more of this," Dora sighed. "Ali, let’s clear out. You get home too, and go stick to your nanny." Patting Ali on the shoulder, Dora puffed out his chest and swaggered away across the sandy beach.

IV

Ekan the tailor, a man legendary for his laziness and his fondness for the ladies, was actually working today. Covered in fabric scraps, he was busily cranking a hand-powered sewing machine. Nearby, the wife he’d acquired three months ago amidst much drama sat sewing on buttons and sobbing quietly. It seemed a violent domestic spat had only just concluded.

"Tch! Dammit all," Ekan grumbled, still fuming despite his usually easygoing nature. "So what if I stay away from home for a day or two?"

"Yo, Ekan! Working hard, I see," called out Dora.

"Well, if it isn't Tuan Dora! What brings you here? Come in..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text follows standard Japanese vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left. It is divided into two main columns with an illustration integrated into the center/bottom left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard mid-century Mincho typeface. Iteration marks like "々" and "ゝ" (for "mojimoji") are used. Dialogue is enclosed in heavy brackets 「 」.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The chapter break "四" (Four) is centered in the column to denote a scene change. The illustration serves as a dramatic focal point, depicting the emotional climax (Johora clinging to Hashim).
*   **Illustration Style:** The drawing style is typical of 1950s Japanese "light literature" or pulp magazines (*zasshi*), featuring a romanticized, slightly Westernized aesthetic for the female character (Johora), emphasizing her "exotic" beauty.
*   **Page Numbering:** A small "( 42 )" is visible at the bottom center.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Setting:** The names (Hashim, Ali, Johora, Ekan) and the use of "Tuan" (a Malay/Indonesian honorific for a master or gentleman) and "Cinta" (Malay/Indonesian for love) suggest a setting in Southeast Asia, likely British Malaya or the Dutch East Indies. 
*   **Nanyo Bungaku (South Seas Literature):** During and after WWII, Japanese readers were fascinated by stories set in Southeast Asia. These stories often combined adventure, exoticism, and romance, often portraying Japanese characters (like "Dora") as influential figures in local communities.
*   **Colonial Influence:** The use of "Tuan" and "Babu" (a term for a servant or nursemaid, often used in colonial Indonesia) highlights the social hierarchy of the era. 
*   **Era:** Based on the orthography (transitioning to modern kana but still using some older kanji forms like "這入れ") and the illustration style, this likely dates from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **トアン (Tuan):** An Indonesian/Malay honorific. Hashim uses it to address Dora, indicating Dora is of higher social status or a patron.
*   **チンタ (Cinta):** Indonesian/Malay for "love" or "beloved." The text explicitly provides the gloss (愛人 - lover/sweetheart).
*   **バブ (Babu):** A term used in the Dutch East Indies for a female servant or nanny.
*   **もぢ／＼ (Mojimoji):** Onomatopoeia for fidgeting or being hesitant. Written here with a vertical iteration mark.
*   **首つ玉 (Kubittama):** A colloquial/rough way of saying "neck" or "scruff of the neck."
*   **のっしのっし (Nosshi-nosshi):** An onomatopoeia for a heavy, swaggering walk.
*   **精が出る (Sei ga deru):** An idiom meaning to work hard or be diligent.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Jealousy and Misunderstanding:** The plot hinges on a classic "misunderstood gift" trope (the ring), leading to Johora's theft out of spite and her subsequent dramatic confession.
*   **The "Rough but Kind" Protagonist:** Dora is portrayed as a worldly, observant, and slightly cynical figure (he laughs at the drama and leaves the lovers to themselves), typical of hard-boiled or adventure protagonists.
*   **Exoticism:** The text leans heavily on the "exotic" nature of the setting—the sand, the dress, the names—to provide escapism for the Japanese reader.
*   **Domestic Conflict:** The second scene with Ekan provides a comic foil to the heavy romance of the first scene, showing the less glamorous side of relationships.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serialized Novel, Pulp Fiction.
*   **Genre:** Romance, Adventure, Drama.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Exoticism, South Seas (Nanyo), Jealousy, Colonial setting, 1950s literature.
