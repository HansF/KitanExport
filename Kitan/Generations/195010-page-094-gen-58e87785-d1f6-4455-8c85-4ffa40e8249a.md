**シベリアのオパツイ小僧**

畫家連中がすばらしいモデルだとほめそやすセントラルのオパツイ小僧は日本ではなかなか見事な存在だろうがシベリヤに行けばあんなのはざらにある。いなあれ以上のものがざらである。
和製オパツイ小僧は、なる程前から見ると胸全部がオッパイだが横から見ると、肩から垂直にペシヤンコで、ただお乳がふくれて居るだけで、少しも美しい曲線で見られない。それにくらべシベリヤのオパツイ小僧はどうだろうか先づ吾々日本人がシベリヤの女を見て先づ目につくのは胸で圧倒されさうな驚異的な見事なオパツイが道行くどの女の胸にも躍り輝いて居る。まだ結婚前の十七八才の娘が子供を生んだ日本人でも見られない様な見事なオパツイを持って居る。それも横から見ると肩からぐつとピラミット型に隆起し今にもはち切れさうな青春の血の躍動が、美しい曲線となつて、あらわれて居る。
此の大きなオパツイと大きな腰部がシベリア美人の第一條件であるというのだから唯物論的ソ連の一端がうかがわれる。
だが何故かかる大きなオッパイを持つて居るのだろう。そこには体格、体質の遺傳性と言うものもあるが、なんと言つても彼女の性生活が大きく反映して居る。即ち愛撫運動としての男の仕事が大いに影響して居るのだとソ連人自身が証言して居る。
だが、このオッパイは絶対と言つていい程人には見せない。田舎の小娘でも蕾がふくらみかけるとブラヂエアーをする。乳当ては女として離す事の出来ぬ、大切な装具である。
或夏農場で仕事が終つてから、吾々日本人はすぐ近くの川で水浴をした。シベリアの夏は大陸的で物凄く暑い、一緒に働く女達の汗、髪の匂い体臭が吾々の鼻に鋭く匂つてくる。十二三人の二十才前後の彼女達も勇敢に吾々と共に水浴したが、ブラヂエアーだけははずさなかつた。
その上水浴が終つて、服を着る時も濡れたブラヂエアーをつけたまま、服を着てしまつた。日本人には一寸解しかねる事である。
此れ程、秘密にしているのを一度私は見た事があるからシベリアのオパツイ小僧をほめるのである。
私の行つてた工場にはシャワー式の風呂があり仕事が終れば自由に毎日は入れいた、或日仕事が早く終つたので空いてる上の女風呂へ友と二人ではいつて、いい気持になつて居るとどや／＼と女達が入つてきた。
飛び出すわけにも行かないし、困つてる内に女達は私のすぐ横にきて、じゃ〜〜とシャワーをかけ始めた。物凄い蒸気だし、まさか日本人が居るとは思いも掛けぬ彼女達は私の目の前で一糸まとわぬ白い肉体をさらけ出した。
私は食べる事にのみ追われていて、二年近くもすつかり忘れてしまつて居た若い焔が怪しくめら／＼燃え出すのを感じた。その時一人の女が私のシャワーに飛び込んでさて「キャー」と派手な悲鳴をあげとう／＼発見され、もう少しで見事な肉体に袋叩きにされる所だつた。とんだ失敗談だつたが、セントラルの和製オパツイ小僧に満足して居る日本畫家連中に、あのシベリアのオパツイ小僧連中を見せてやりたいと思う。

**シベリア女の貞操**

貞操觀念 此れはシベリヤでは一世紀前の死語で、現代語にはない言葉である。
今日の日本の新聞には失戀自殺や、心中の書いてない日はない位だが「なにも死ななくても、男は一人じゃあるまいし」と言うのが常識で「まず欲望を満すのが人生の最大にして全部の目的である」と言うシベリヤには心中や失戀自殺等は珍らしい出来事で滅多にない。

**秋宵獵 奇談集 僧の娘の怪**

昔、奈良の大安寺の別當をしている僧の一人娘のもとに、毎夜通つてくる蔵人があつた。それも夜だけでは足りないので、昼も泊ることがあつた。
蔵人がある時、晝（ひる）していると俄かにこの家の人々が泣き騒いでいるので、何んだろうと、怪しく思つて出て見ると、皆の者が大きな土器（かわらけ）を持つて泣いていた。彼は不思議に思つて、よく見ると、鬼ですら飲みかねない程の熱湯を泣く／＼呑んでいるのであつた。そして自分の傍に寝ていた女も、母親が来て呼び起し、連れてゆくので見て居ると、女に大きな土器に熱湯をなみなみと入れて渡した。それを女は悲しい声を出して泣き／＼呑むのであつた。女の美しい目や鼻からは、煙がゆら／＼と上つていた。
何ということだろう、と情けないと眺めていると、母親はその土器を女から取り上げて
蔵人にも飲ませましょう、と言いながら、熱湯を溢々と注いだその大きな盃を持つてきたので、自分もそれを呑まねばならんだろうかと、はつと驚いて夢が醒めた。
丁度その時、女が彼のところへ食膳を持つて来たが、なんとなく気持が悪くなり、食べずに家へ帰つてしまつた。そしてその後再びその女の處へ行かないようになつてしまつた。

**シベリアのおっぱい小僧**

画家連中が素晴らしいモデルだと褒めそやすセントラルのおっぱい小僧は、日本ではなかなか見事な存在だろうが、シベリアに行けばあんなのはざらにある。いや、あれ以上のものがざらである。
和製おっぱい小僧は、なるほど前から見ると胸全部がおっぱいだが、横から見ると肩から垂直にぺしゃんこで、ただお乳が膨らんでいるだけで、少しも美しい曲線で見られない。それに比べシベリアのおっぱい小僧はどうだろうか。まず我々日本人がシベリアの女を見てまず目につくのは胸で、圧倒されそうな驚異的な見事なおっぱいが道行くどの女の胸にも躍り輝いている。まだ結婚前の十七、八歳の娘が、子供を産んだ日本人でも見られないような見事なおっぱいを持っている。それも横から見ると肩からぐっとピラミッド型に隆起し、今にもはち切れそうな青春の血の躍動が、美しい曲線となって表れている。
この大きなおっぱいと大きな腰部がシベリア美人の第一条件であるというのだから、唯物論的ソ連の一端がうかがわれる。
だが、なぜこれほど大きなおっぱいを持っているのだろう。そこには体格、体質の遺伝性というものもあるが、何と言っても彼女たちの性生活が大きく反映している。即ち愛撫運動としての男の仕事が大いに影響しているのだと、ソ連人自身が証言している。
だが、このおっぱいは絶対と言っていいほど人には見せない。田舎の小娘でも蕾が膨らみかけるとブラジャーをする。乳当ては女として離すことのできない、大切な装具である。
ある夏、農場で仕事が終わってから、我々日本人はすぐ近くの川で水浴をした。シベリアの夏は大陸的で物凄く暑い。一緒に働く女たちの汗、髪の匂い、体臭が我々の鼻に鋭く匂ってくる。十二、三人の二十歳前後の彼女たちも勇敢に我々と共に水浴したが、ブラジャーだけは外さなかった。
その上、水浴が終わって服を着る時も、濡れたブラジャーをつけたまま服を着てしまった。日本人には一寸理解しがたいことである。
これほど秘密にしているのを、一度私は見たことがあるから、シベリアのおっぱい小僧を褒めるのである。
私の行っていた工場にはシャワー式の風呂があり、仕事が終われば自由に毎日入れた。ある日仕事が早く終わったので、空いている上の女風呂へ友と二人で入り、いい気持ちになっていると、どやどやと女たちが入ってきた。
飛び出すわけにもいかないし、困っているうちに、女たちは私のすぐ横に来て、ジャーとシャワーをかけ始めた。物凄い蒸気だし、まさか日本人がいるとは思いも掛けぬ彼女たちは、私の目の前で一糸まとわぬ白い肉体をさらけ出した。
私は食べることにのみ追われていて、二年近くもすっかり忘れてしまっていた若い焔（ほのお）が怪しくめらめら燃え出すのを感じた。その時一人の女が私のシャワーに飛び込んできて「キャー」と派手な悲鳴を上げ、とうとう発見され、もう少しで見事な肉体に袋叩きにされるところだった。とんだ失敗談だったが、セントラルの和製おっぱい小僧に満足している日本画家連中に、あのシベリアのおっぱい小僧連中を見せてやりたいと思う。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**The Breast Brat of Siberia**

The "Central Breast Brat" whom the group of painters praise as a wonderful model might be a quite splendid existence in Japan, but if one goes to Siberia, such things are common. No, things better than that are common.
The Japanese-made breast brat, indeed from the front the whole chest is breast, but seen from the side, from the shoulder it is vertically flat, just the milk-parts are swollen, and not even a little beautiful curve can be seen. Compared to that, how about the Siberian breast brat? First, what we Japanese see first when looking at Siberian women is the chest; overwhelming, miraculous, splendid breasts are leaping and shining on the chest of every woman walking the road. Even a pre-marriage girl of 17 or 18 has splendid breasts like cannot be seen even in a Japanese woman who has given birth. Also, looking from the side, they protrude firmly from the shoulder in a pyramid shape, the throb of youthful blood about to burst appears as a beautiful curve.
Since this large breast and large hip area are the first conditions of a Siberian beauty, one can glimpse an edge of the materialistic Soviet Union.
But why do they have such large breasts? There is the heredity of physique and constitution, but more than anything, their sex life is greatly reflected. That is, the "work of men" as caressing movement has a great influence, so the Soviet people themselves testify.
However, these breasts they do not show to people to an almost absolute degree. Even a little girl in the countryside, once the buds begin to swell, puts on a brassiere. The breast-guard is an important equipment for a woman that cannot be separated.
One summer, after work at the farm ended, we Japanese bathed in a nearby river. The Siberian summer is continental and dreadfully hot. The sweat of the women working together, the smell of hair, and body odor smell sharply to our noses. Twelve or thirteen of them, around 20 years old, bravely bathed with us, but they did not take off only the brassiere.
Furthermore, when bathing ended and they put on clothes, they put on clothes while keeping the wet brassieres on. For a Japanese, it is a thing a bit difficult to understand.
Because I saw once what they keep so secret, I praise the Siberian breast brat.
At the factory I went to, there was a shower-style bath, and we could enter freely every day when work ended. One day, work ended early, so I entered the empty women's bath above with a friend, and while feeling good, women came in noisily.
We couldn't just jump out, and while troubled, the women came right next to me and started the shower with a "jaaah." It was incredible steam, and they, never dreaming a Japanese person would be there, exposed their white bodies without a single thread before my eyes.
I had been driven only by eating, and the young flame I had completely forgotten for nearly two years felt like it started to burn suspiciously. At that time, one woman jumped into my shower and let out a flashy "Kyaa!" scream, and finally I was discovered, and I was almost beaten up by those splendid bodies. It was a terrible failure story, but to the Japanese painters satisfied with the Central "Japanese-made" breast brat, I want to show those Siberian breast brats.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The "Breast Brats" of Siberia**

The "Central Breast Brat"—a nickname for a certain model much-lauded by the local art crowd—might be considered quite a specimen in Japan, but in Siberia, women like her are a dime a dozen. In fact, you'll find plenty who far surpass her.
The "Japanese-made" version of the well-endowed woman may look impressive from the front, but from the profile, her chest is flat as a board from the shoulder down, with nothing but the breasts themselves protruding. There is no grace to the curve. By contrast, the Siberian women are a revelation. The first thing we Japanese notice is their overwhelming, almost miraculous bosoms, which seem to pulse with vitality on every woman you pass in the street. Even an unmarried girl of seventeen or eighteen possesses a figure more magnificent than a Japanese woman who has already borne children. Viewed from the side, their breasts rise sharply from the shoulder in a firm, pyramidal shape—a beautiful curve that seems ready to burst with the vibrant pulse of youth.
Because a large bust and wide hips are the primary standards of Siberian beauty, one can catch a glimpse of the "materialistic" nature of the Soviet Union.
But why are they so well-endowed? While genetics and constitution play a part, the primary reason is said to be their active sex lives. According to the Soviets themselves, the "attentions" of their men provide a significant physical stimulus.
Despite this, they are incredibly modest. Even a young girl in the countryside will don a "brassiere" as soon as she begins to develop. To them, it is an indispensable piece of equipment.
One summer, after finishing work at the farm, we Japanese went to bathe in a nearby river. The Siberian summer is brutally hot. The sharp scent of sweat, hair, and skin from the women we worked with filled our noses. About a dozen of these women, all in their early twenties, joined us in the water quite boldly, yet they never removed their brassieres. Even more puzzling to us was that they would pull their clothes on over the soaking-wet garments once they were done.
The reason I speak so highly of these women is that I once caught a forbidden glimpse of what they keep so hidden.
The factory where I worked had a shower room we could use freely after our shifts. One day, having finished early, a friend and I slipped into the empty women's shower. Just as we were relaxing, a crowd of women burst in. Trapped, we stayed put as they gathered right next to us. Amidst the thick clouds of steam, never imagining a Japanese man was present, they stripped completely bare.
For nearly two years, I had been focused on nothing but survival and finding my next meal, but in that moment, the long-forgotten embers of youth began to smolder within me. Suddenly, a woman jumped into my shower stall, let out a piercing shriek, and the jig was up. I was nearly beaten to a pulp by those magnificent specimens of womanhood. It was a disastrous blunder, but I can’t help wishing I could show those Japanese painters, so satisfied with their local models, what a real "Siberian" figure looks like.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a traditional Japanese vertical layout (*tategaki*) divided into three distinct columns.
*   **Typography:** The main headings are set in a larger, bold font. The body text is a standard serif typeface typical of mid-century Japanese printing.
*   **Illustration:** A single line-drawing illustration occupies the top right, depicting a woman in a headscarf (babushka style), which visually reinforces the "Siberian/Russian" theme of the lead article.
*   **Structure:** The page contains three distinct pieces of content:
    1.  A memoir/essay about the physique of Siberian women.
    2.  A short social commentary on the concept of chastity in the Soviet Union.
    3.  A "strange tale" (*kidan*) set in ancient Nara, which serves as filler or a thematic contrast (traditional vs. modern/foreign).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "シベリアのオパツイ小僧" is the primary focal point, followed by the shorter sub-article on chastity and finally the folklore story at the bottom. The use of "オパツイ" (a slang/colloquialism) in the title suggests a tabloid or "men’s interest" magazine style.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Siberian Internment:** The text refers to "we Japanese" (*吾々日本人*) working in "factories" and "farms" in Siberia. This identifies the author as one of the approximately 600,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians interned in Soviet labor camps after WWII (1945–1956).
*   **The "Materialistic" Soviet Union:** The author mentions "唯物論的ソ連" (Materialistic Soviet Union). This refers to Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism. In the Japanese view of the time, the USSR was often seen as a place where physical and practical needs (and physical bodies) were prioritized over the "spiritual" or "sentimental" traditions of Japan.
*   **Contrast in Femininity:** There is a strong emphasis on the "sturdiness" and "voluptuousness" of Russian women compared to the "flatness" of Japanese women. This reflects a common trope in *hikiage-sha* (repatriate) literature, where the shock of encountering European body types was a frequent topic of conversation.
*   **The Term "Central":** The "Central" (*セントラル*) mentioned likely refers to a famous cabaret, theater, or art circle in Tokyo during the early occupation period where models were commonly discussed.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **オパツイ (Opatsui):** A phonetic variation of *oppai* (breasts). The use of the full-sized 'tsu' and the 'i' ending is a slangy, somewhat archaic way of saying "boobs."
*   **小僧 (Kozō):** Literally "little priest" or "brat/lad." Here it is used as a personification or a cute nickname for breasts themselves, or perhaps referring to a woman known for them.
*   **和製 (Wasei):** "Japanese-made." Often used to contrast domestic versions of things with foreign (usually Western) originals.
*   **ブラヂエアー (Burajieā):** An archaic transliteration of "brassiere." Modern Japanese uses *burajā*.
*   **一糸まとわぬ (Isshi matowanu):** "Without a single thread"; stark naked. A common literary idiom.
*   **袋叩き (Fukuro-dataki):** To be beaten soundly or mobbed.
*   **蔵人 (Kurando):** An official of the Imperial Archive in the Heian period. Its appearance in the bottom story signals a shift to classical folklore.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Male Gaze and Survival:** The author notes that for two years he forgot his "youthful flames" because he was focused only on "eating" (survival). This highlights the deprivation of the Siberian camps.
*   **Body Image and National Identity:** The text uses the female body as a site of national comparison. The "pyramidal" and "bursting" Russian body is contrasted with the "flat" Japanese body, reflecting a post-war Japanese feeling of physical and national inferiority or simply "smallness" in the face of the victors/superpowers.
*   **Sexual Morality:** The second section paints the Soviet Union as a place devoid of "chastity" (*teiso*), where survival and desire are paramount. This was a common piece of anti-Soviet or "culture shock" propaganda, framing the USSR as hyper-pragmatic and spiritually empty compared to Japan's "sentimental" culture of suicide and unrequited love.
*   **The Erotic Memoir:** Despite the hardships of internment, these types of stories were popular in "low-brow" magazines (*kasutori* magazines) because they provided a mix of travelogue, war memoir, and soft eroticism.
