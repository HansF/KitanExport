## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

東両国には、籠細工、ギヤマン細工と頗る新奇なものが、しきりに客の目を驚かした。
この傾向はひとり両国ばかりではなく、浅草の奥山でも、客足のよいのは近頃流行の細工物の見世物であった。因果物では、もう客は集らなかった。
因果を売り物にした蜘蛛男の福助は、めっきり寂れた自分の小屋のうす汚ない楽屋でしさりに愚痴をこぼしていた。
小屋の幟に風が吹きすすんで、パタ～～と淋しいすすり泣きする冬がやつて来た。
蜘蛛男の見世物は、日増しに、見物が減り囃の太鼓の音も細々と、福助の収入は際立って減って来た。
自分の醜い姿を十分自覚していた蜘蛛男の福助は、なにより金銭を必要とした。

その頃の福助の周囲は、明けても暮れても女、女、女、であった。興行師は、その特別な地位を利用して、自分の手にある商品の中から、かなり変った種類の女を彼にあてがつた。
それは福助が単調に飽きない為でもあり、又、それ等の女達は、極めて僅かな報酬で彼に供託することが出来たからであった。福助が、あらゆる変った女の肉体を漁りつくしたのはその頃の事であった。
その中でもさすが蜘蛛男も怖れをなして、いぺんで願い下げにしたのは、両腕と両耳のない「徳利女」で、案外凄い腕を持っていたのは小人島一行中の子供のように小さな年増女であった。
が、なんと言っても、一番閉口したのは、身長六尺二寸、体重三十八貫目といふ大女を力持の小屋から連れて来て、あてがわれた時であった。

二度の御開帳で、少なからぬ金を儲けたのは事実だったがそれも、現在住んでいる家が一軒幾つたきりで、僅か半年と経たない中に奇麗に使い果してしまっていた。
僅か七ツ八ツの子供位の身長より持たなかつた一寸法師の福助は、酒も食慾もすべて普通人以下であつたが、その性慾だけは、すばらしく、激しかった。それで世間の女とゆう女が、どれ程金とゆう物に対して、強い愛着を持つているかとゆうことを、知り過ぎる程知っていた。
従つて彼が女に対して使う金は莫大なものであり、女に対しての支拂いならば決して延期したり滞納したりするようなことはなかつた。彼にとって、女は、享楽以上に最も必要な食料だったのである。嘗て、蜘蛛男の人気が広小路を圧していた頃、彼と出演を契約した興業師は、福助が他の興業師の手へ逃れるのを恐れて、あらゆる方法をもって彼の歓心をかつた。福助が異常な性慾を持つている事を知った敏腕な興行師は、彼のために好餌を与える事を忘れなかった。

○
一人前の太夫元となつて、金が自由になればなる程、放縦に慣らされた福助の生活は、益々淫蕩なものになって行つた。
木戸番の甲州松とゆう男は、福助への忠義だては、いつも女をとり持っていた。その男は、自分と馴染の水茶屋の女と馴れ合って彼から少なからぬ金を搾つた事もあった。
然し、近頃のように、小屋が寂れてしまつては、松を通じて、いろんな女と会うことも出来なかつた。
細工物の大流行によって受けた大打撃を彼はどうに....

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

In East Ryogoku, basketwork, glasswork, and very novel things, constantly surprised the eyes of customers. This tendency was not only in Ryogoku; in Asakusa’s Okuyama too, those with good customer traffic were the recently popular craft shows. With "causality things" (freak shows), customers no longer gathered.
Fukusuke the Spider Man, who made "causality" his selling point, was constantly grumbling in the dirty dressing room of his noticeably declined shack.
The wind blew hard against the shack's banners, and the winter that makes a lonely "pata-pata" sobbing sound arrived.
The Spider Man's show, day by day, spectators decreased; the sound of the accompaniment drums became faint, and Fukusuke's income conspicuously decreased.
Fukusuke the Spider Man, who was fully aware of his own ugly appearance, needed money above all else.

In those days, Fukusuke’s surroundings were, from dawn to dusk, woman, woman, woman. The showman (promoter), utilizing his special position, from among the "merchandise" in his hands, assigned women of quite unusual types to him.
That was so Fukusuke would not get bored with monotony, and also because those women could be provided to him for an extremely small reward. It was around that time that Fukusuke finished fishing through the flesh of every kind of unusual woman.
Among them, as expected, even the Spider Man was frightened and rejected after one time the "Bottle Woman" who had no arms and no ears; and the one who had unexpectedly amazing "arms" (skills) was a middle-aged woman as small as a child from the Little Person Island troupe.
But, whatever one says, the time he was most at a loss was when a giant woman of height 6 shaku 2 sun and weight 38 kanme was brought from the strength-show shack and assigned to him.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

In the East Ryogoku district, the public’s fickle gaze had shifted toward the novel and the intricate—displays of master basketwork and shimmering glasswork now drew the crowds. This trend wasn't limited to Ryogoku; even in the depths of Asakusa’s Okuyama, the only attractions turning a profit were these fashionable craft exhibits. The "curiosity shows" of the deformed and the damned—the *inga-mono*—could no longer command an audience.

Fukusuke, the "Spider Man" whose livelihood depended on his grotesque misfortune, sat in the filthy dressing room of his dilapidated theater, muttering bitter complaints. Winter had arrived; the wind whipped through the theater’s banners with a sound like a lonely, rhythmic sobbing. Day by day, the crowds dwindled. The once-thundering drums of the barkers grew faint and hollow, and Fukusuke’s income withered away. Fully conscious of his own hideous form, Fukusuke knew that, more than anything else, he required gold to survive.

During his peak, Fukusuke’s world was consumed by women. His promoter, exploiting his position of power, would provide him with "merchandise" from his stable—women of the most peculiar varieties. This was done partly to keep Fukusuke from growing bored and partly because these unfortunate women could be procured for a pittance. In those days, Fukusuke had sampled the flesh of every strange woman imaginable. Even he, the Spider Man, had been recoiled in horror from the "Bottle Woman"—a creature without arms or ears. In contrast, he had been surprised by the "skills" of a middle-aged woman no larger than a child from a troupe of midgets. But nothing had overwhelmed him quite like the time they brought him a giantess from the "Strength Show," a woman standing over six feet tall and weighing over three hundred pounds.

Though he had once amassed a fortune during two successful seasons, he had spent it all on a single house and squandered the rest in less than six months. Fukusuke, a "One-Inch Boy" no taller than a seven-year-old child, possessed a physical appetite for food and drink far below that of a normal man, yet his sexual lust was extraordinarily fierce. He knew all too well how much the women of the world adored money. Consequently, the sums he spent on women were vast, and he never once delayed a payment to them. To him, women were more than a pleasure; they were a necessary sustenance. Back when his popularity dominated the broadstreets, his promoter—fearing Fukusuke might defect to a rival—had used every means to curry his favor, never forgetting to dangle "fresh bait" to satisfy his abnormal cravings.

Now a master of his own troupe, the more freedom his money bought him, the more debauched his life became. His gatekeeper, a man known as Koshu-matsu, acted as his pimp to prove his loyalty. Once, Matsu had even conspired with a woman from a teahouse to swindle a large sum of money from him. But now that the theater had fallen into ruin, he could no longer afford to meet women through Matsu. Hit hard by the craze for craft exhibits, he wondered how he would...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in vertical columns (*tategaki*), typical of Japanese periodicals.
*   **Illustrations:** The page features hand-drawn illustrations that wrap around the text. The style is reminiscent of "Shin-hanga" or Taisho-era magazine art, focusing on the grotesque and the sensual.
    *   Top: A woman's legs and a chair, suggesting an interior setting.
    *   Center: A portrait of "Fukusuke" (depicted with a shaved head, appearing like a small man or child) and a woman in a kimono.
    *   Bottom: A landscape of a *Misemono-goya* (show shack) with banners.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface used in printing presses of the era. It uses traditional kanji forms (like 體 instead of 体 in some older prints, though this specific print seems to use some simplified forms, suggesting a mid-Showa transition).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustrations serve to break up the dense text and draw the eye to the "Spider Man" character, emphasizing his small stature and the "Ero-Guro" theme.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Misemono-goya (見世物小屋):** These were "freak shows" or curiosity theaters popular from the Edo period through the early Showa era. They featured people with physical deformities, "unusual" talents, or exotic animals.
*   **Inga-mono (因果物):** Literally "things of karma/causality." In the context of freak shows, physical disabilities were often cruelly explained as the result of bad karma from a previous life or a parent's sins.
*   **Tokuri-onna (徳利女):** Literally "Bottle Woman." This refers to performers born without limbs (phocomelia or similar conditions) who were displayed in these shows.
*   **Ero-Guro Nonsense (エログロナンセンス):** A cultural movement in 1920s and 30s Japan that obsessed over the erotic, the grotesque, and the absurd. This text is a classic example of this literary style, focusing on the carnal desires of a marginalized, "deformed" individual.
*   **Ryogoku and Asakusa:** Historically the entertainment districts of Tokyo. Ryogoku was famous for sumo and fireworks, while Asakusa (specifically the Okuyama area) was the heart of street performances and theaters.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Giyaman (ギヤマン):** From the Dutch *diamant*. In the Edo/Meiji period, it referred to cut glass or diamond-glass.
*   **Fukusuke (福助):** A common name for a traditional "lucky" doll depicting a large-headed dwarf. Here it is the character's name, likely a stage name playing on his appearance.
*   **Issun-boushi (一寸法師):** The "One-Inch Boy" from Japanese folklore. Used here as a descriptor for his dwarfism.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Commodification of the Body:** The text explicitly refers to the women and the performers as "merchandise" (*shōhin*).
*   **Decline of Traditional Entertainment:** The story begins by noting that traditional "freak shows" are losing out to modern "craft" exhibits, symbolizing a shift in public taste toward the "civilized" and "refined."
*   **Lust vs. Physicality:** There is a heavy focus on the contrast between Fukusuke's small, "ugly" body and his "abnormal" and "fierce" sexual desire. This is a common trope in *Ero-Guro* literature—the idea that the "monstrous" body harbors "monstrous" desires.
*   **Exploitation:** The relationship between the promoter and Fukusuke is purely transactional; the promoter provides women as "bait" to keep his star attraction profitable.
