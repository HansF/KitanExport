## Literal English Translation

Nor is it because I have slept long (died), nor is it because the writing is rich in content, what shall I offer as a farewell gift? If that is the case, even a gift is against my true intention.
From the time when the old man is prone to waking from sleep, he thinks deeply and recalls, and so it seems he writes this text, lamenting and grumbling, saying, "If you think you love me, read this text again and again, and perform this (duty) at midnight. If it is heard that you serve diligently, like a good text, my joy will be boundless."

〇Furthermore, there are various details regarding this filial piety: dwelling by the parents' side, morning and evening awaiting their affection and observing the veil (of privacy), or being a child who honors the great compassion as a testament, following in their footsteps, performing painstaking acts again and again. It is surely dedicated to this service now.
The wealthy person offers wisdom as a farewell gift, the wise person offers substance/truth as a farewell gift, so they say. I, too, shall be among the wise persons.

(Second Section)
...to be the glory of a hundred nations, truly instructing that woman, and granting the White Jewel.
It is not a precious thing; moreover, it is like the foolish attempt to produce writing, soaking up water, merely producing this thin text. If we regret that this matter will surely conclude without fail... [metaphor]... it prevents the creeping vine of the *Masaki* tree from burrowing down to propagate its child. The nature of this taboo is difficult to avoid, and therefore, I scoop (it) from the Spring of Eternal Youth.

## Literary English Translation

This is neither my eternal rest, nor does this essay boast great merit. What offering, then, should I send as a farewell? Yet, even offering a gift goes against my deepest wishes.

From the season when this old man is easily stirred from his sleep, he muses deeply, and so he writes this composition, sighing and muttering his sorrows. He instructs: "If you truly believe you cherish me, scrutinize this essay repeatedly, and perform this duty in the dead of night. Should word reach me that you are serving diligently, as if following a perfect manuscript, then my happiness will know no bounds."

Furthermore, the duties inherent in filial piety are manifold: residing by the side of the parents, anticipating their needs and affection morning and evening, observing the necessary private boundaries (the veil), or acting as a child who demonstrates reverence for their great mercy by walking in their footsteps and performing consistent, earnest deeds. This devotion is the very core of your service now.
The rich bequeath wisdom as their legacy; the wise bequeath substance and truth. I, too, shall strive to be counted among the wise.

(Second Section)
...to achieve the glory of a hundred nations, truly training that woman, and bestowing upon her the White Jewel.
It is not an object of veneration. Rather, it resembles the futile manner in which a foolish writer produces text, soaking up water and merely giving birth to this flimsy composition. If we lament that this endeavor will swiftly conclude... it is as if attempting to prevent the *Masaki* vine from burrowing beneath the earth to propagate its young. The nature of this taboo is hard to evade. Therefore, I seek to draw sustenance from the Spring of Eternal Youth.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Attribute | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Didactic Essay / Philosophical *Zuihitsu* (miscellaneous essay), written in the persona of an authoritative, reflective patriarch. It functions as a meta-commentary on a moral duty that has a scandalous, subtextual application. |
| **Author Attribution** | Implicitly, the "Old Man" (老ぢ), but editorially, it is an unnamed writer or the magazine's cultural correspondent. |
| **Editorial Voice** | Highly archaic and classical (Historical Kana Usage), mimicking Meiji-era scholarly or literary prose to lend gravity and authority to the subject matter. |
| **Narrator Voice** | The narrator is the "Old Man," reflecting on his legacy, his physical decline (*nezamegachi*), and the nature of the duty he is passing on. |
| **Target Audience** | Readers interested in the confluence of classical Japanese morality (孝, duty) and contemporary/transgressive sexual practices (implied by "White Jewel" and "training that woman"). |
| **Positioning** | Page 17 suggests it is a core piece of commentary or high-brow fiction/reportage, early in the publication. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Term/Concept | Contextual Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **長き眼ぬる (Nagaki me nuru)** | A classical euphemism for permanent sleep or death. The narrator is asserting that his current reflection is not his final testament but an urgent instruction. |
| **老ぢのねざめ (Oji no nezame)** | The frequent awakening of the old man highlights his physical fragility and obsession with the task/legacy, a common trope establishing patriarchal urgency in traditional narratives. |
| **孝 (Setsu / Filial Piety)** | The essay provides a standard definition of traditional filial piety (bedside service, diligence) only to immediately subvert it by tying this "duty" to a secret, "midnight" task. |
| **訓 (Oshie)** | Training or instruction. In *Kitan Club* context, "training a woman" often implies detailed sexual education, discipline, or preparation for a specific erotic ritual. |
| **白玉 (Shiratama / White Jewel)** | Highly significant euphemism. It refers metonymically to female purity, specifically the hymen or virginity. Bestowing the "White Jewel" suggests ritualistic defloration or the transfer of innocence/power/value. |
| **正木の蔓 (Masaki no Kazura)** | The *Masaki* (Euonymus japonicus) is an evergreen known for its resilient, creeping roots. Here, it symbolizes the primal, unstoppable force of nature, desire, or biological propagation (子伝へる - propagating the child). The narrator tries to "prevent" this natural force through his instruction. |
| **不老泉 (Furōsen / Spring of Eternal Youth)** | A classical/Taoist reference to finding immortality or vigor. Its inclusion elevates the sexual themes (White Jewel, Masaki vine) from simple lust to an esoteric practice aimed at preserving vitality or transferring energy—a core theme in Japanese ero-guro and certain forms of occultism. |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Kanji/Kana) | Reading (Normalized) | Literal Meaning | Contextual/Euphemistic Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ながしめぬる** | Nagakime nuru | To sleep a long eye | Death, final rest, being permanently absent. |
| **なむけ (餞)** | Namuke | Farewell gift, send-off | Legacy, final instruction, philosophical contribution. |
| **老ぢ (老爺)** | Oji | Old man/Elder | Patriarch, the speaker, the controller of the ritual. |
| **哀づつ** | Aigutsu | While lamenting/grieving | Musing reflectively, complaining (ブツ／＼ reinforces this). |
| **つと (務)** | Tsutome | Duty, service, diligence | The specific task demanded by the father. |
| **とばり (帳)** | Tobari | Curtain, veil | Privacy, the sanctity of the parental chamber, or the secrecy surrounding the duty. |
| **訓 (おしへ)** | Oshie | Instruction, teaching | Sexual/moral/ritualistic training for a woman. |
| **白玉 (しらたま)** | Shiratama | White jewel/pearl | Female virginity, the hymen, or the physical vessel of purity. |
| **いなみ (忌み)** | Inami | Taboo, avoidance, dread | The cultural or moral prohibition associated with the ritual being discussed. |
| **實 (じつ)** | Jitsu | Substance, reality, truth | Tangible action or innate quality, contrasted with theoretical 'wisdom' (賢). |

## Themes & Subtext

| Dominant Themes | Subtextual Interpretation & Implications |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Patriarchal Authority & Control** | The text is a mechanism for the aging father to exert absolute control over the successor (and the unnamed woman) even in his physical decline. The "service at midnight" and "training" imply secretive, controlled acts. |
| **The Nature of Legacy** | The narrator struggles with what to leave behind (wisdom vs. substance/truth). The actual legacy is revealed to be the enforcement of a ritual involving female purity and the maintenance of esoteric knowledge (不老泉). |
| **Erotic Ritualization** | The juxtaposition of moralizing filial piety with the specific instruction ("training that woman," "White Jewel") indicates that the "duty" is highly sexualized and ritualistic, likely involving the transfer or appropriation of female vitality or purity. |
| **The Futility of Moralizing** | The metaphor of the "flimsy text" and the unstoppable *Masaki* vine suggests an anxiety that cultural/moral controls (represented by his writing) are weak against primal, biological imperatives (represented by the vine's relentless propagation). |
| **Forbidden Knowledge** | The references to *Inami* (taboo) and *Furōsen* (Eternal Spring) locate the text within the ero-guro fascination with transgressive acts justified by higher, esoteric, or occult aims, often involving sexuality and longevity. |

## Content Classification Tags
