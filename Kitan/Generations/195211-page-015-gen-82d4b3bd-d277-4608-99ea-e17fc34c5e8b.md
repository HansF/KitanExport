**Column 1 (Upper Left):**
「松下さん」
秋代がよばれて振返えると、さきに帰えつたはずの関良子が学校の前の貸本屋から出て来た。秋代が校門を出るのを見張つていたらしい。
ふだんから醜聞（うわさ）めいたうわさのある関良子だつたが、秋代とは帰る道が同じだつたから親しく話をしないでもなかつた。
「ねえ、松下さん、私に一寸つきあつてくれない？」
「なあに？」
「あのね、あんたアルバイトやつてみない？」
良子は秋代と肩を並べて、駅の方へ歩き出しながら言つた。
「雑誌の口絵写真のモデルなんだけど、髪の毛の長い人をとりたいんですつて……。あんたの髪、黒くて長くてとてもいいと思うのだけど……」

**Column 2 (Bottom Right):**
級友のほとんどが、短かく髪を切つてコールドパーマをかけていた。電髪のチリチリしたのにくらべて少女らしく清楚にもみえ、ひとりがやり出してからクラス中の流行になつていたのだ。秋代のように肩までたれる長い髪をパーマもかけずに、細い黒いリボンで結んでいるのは珍らしかつた。いつてみればパーマをかけるゆとりがなかつたのだが、その為、いいアルバイトがあるというのなら秋代にとつてもつけの幸だつた。
しかし、一寸不安になつて
「まさか裸体写真ではないのでしようね？」
秋代は念を押した。ただ黒い髪の美しさをとるだけのモデルなら不服はなかつた。
「モチ、裸体ぢやないわ、それは保証するわよ」
「そんなら行つてもいいけど、これからすぐ行くの？」

The Flogging of Tragic Love — 20

**Title:**
The Flogging of Tragic Love
Part 1
[Author] Matsui Raiko
[Illustration] Kita Reiko

**Text:**
"Matsushita-san."
When Akiyo was called and looked back, Seki Yoshiko, who was supposed to have gone home earlier, came out of the rental book shop in front of the school. It seemed she had been watching for Akiyo to exit the school gate.
She was a Seki Yoshiko who had scandal-like rumors about her ordinarily, but since her way home was the same as Akiyo's, it wasn't as if they didn't speak familiarly.
"Hey, Matsushita-san, won't you accompany me for a moment?"
"What is it?"
"Well, you see, won't you try doing a part-time job (*arubaito*)?"
Yoshiko lined up her shoulders with Akiyo and, while starting to walk toward the station, said:
"It is a model for a magazine frontispiece photo, but they say they want to take [photos of] a person with long hair... I think your hair, being black and long, is very good, but..."

Most of her classmates had cut their hair short and gotten "cold perms." Compared to the frizzy nature of "electric hair" (*denpatsu*), it looked maiden-like and neat, and since one person started doing it, it had become a trend throughout the class. It was rare to have long hair hanging to the shoulders without a perm, tied with a thin black ribbon, like Akiyo. If one were to say it, she didn't have the spare money to get a perm, but because of that, if there was a good part-time job, it was a stroke of good luck for Akiyo too.
However, becoming a little anxious,
"It isn't a nude photo, is it?"
Akiyo pressed for confirmation. If it was a model just to capture the beauty of black hair, she had no objection.
"Of course (*Mochi*), it's not a nude, that I guarantee."
"If that's the case, I don't mind going, but are we going right now?"

**The Scourging of Tragic Love** — Page 20

**Title:**
**THE SCOURGING OF TRAGIC LOVE**
*Chapter 1*
By Matsui Raiko
Illustrated by Kita Reiko

**Text:**
"Matsushita-san."

Hearing her name, Akiyo turned around to see Seki Yoshiko—who should have gone home some time ago—emerging from the rental bookshop opposite the school. It seemed she had been lying in wait for Akiyo to step out the school gates.

Yoshiko was the subject of constant, scandalous rumors. However, as they took the same route home, they were not exactly strangers.

"Say, Matsushita-san, could you keep me company for a bit?"
"What for?"
"Listen, would you be interested in a part-time job?"

Falling into step beside Akiyo, Yoshiko began walking toward the station as she spoke.

"It's modeling work for the frontispiece of a magazine. They said they want to photograph someone with long hair... Your hair is so black and long, I thought it would be perfect..."

Almost all their classmates had cut their hair short and gotten "cold perms." Compared to the frizzy, burnt look of the old "electric perms," the cold perm looked neat and maidenly; once one girl had done it, the style swept through the class like a fever. It was rare now to see a girl like Akiyo, with unpermed hair hanging to her shoulders, tied simply with a slender black ribbon. Truth be told, Akiyo simply couldn't afford a perm—but if that lack of funds meant she was suited for a well-paying job, then it was a stroke of incredible luck.

Still, a flicker of anxiety crossed her mind.
"It isn't... nude photography, is it?"
Akiyo pressed her on this point. If she was modeling only to capture the beauty of her black hair, she had no complaints.

"Of *course* not. It's not nude. I guarantee it."
"If that's the case, I suppose I could go. Do we leave right now?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Genre:** *Kitan* (Strange Tale) / *Ero-Guro* (Erotic Grotesque) fiction.
*   **Format:** Serialized novella or short story (indicated by the "1" under the title).
*   **Narrative Voice:** Third-person limited (focused on Akiyo). The tone is descriptive but carries a heavy foreshadowing typical of the genre.
*   **Visual Layout:**
    *   **Illustrations:** The detached eye (top) and the shoe (bottom) are surrealist/avant-garde touches common in *Kitan Club* layouts, suggesting voyeurism and domination/submission themes before the story even begins.
    *   **Typography:** The title uses a distressed, heavy font for "笞刑" (Flogging), emphasizing the sadomasochistic theme.
*   **Role in Magazine:** This appears to be a lead fiction piece. The recruitment of an innocent schoolgirl is a classic intro hook for readers of this genre.

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **The Rental Bookshop (Kashihon-ya 貸本屋):** In the Showa 20s-30s (1940s-50s), these were major hubs for popular culture. Crucially, they were places where students might linger, making them plausible locations for illicit recruitment or delinquency in fiction.
*   **Cold Perm vs. Electric Perm (Denpatsu):**
    *   **Electric Perm (電髪):** Pre-war and immediate post-war method using heavy heated clamps. Associated with older, stiffer styles.
    *   **Cold Perm:** A chemical wave method that became popular in the 1950s. It was softer and considered more "modern" and "maidenly" (seiso). Akiyo's lack of a perm marks her as either traditional or, more likely, economically disadvantaged, which makes her vulnerable to financial enticement.
*   **"Arubaito" (アルバイト):** Derived from the German *Arbeit* (work). In this era, it specifically referred to student part-time work.
*   **Magazine Frontispiece (Kuchie 口絵):** The glossy, often color pages at the start of a magazine. In pulp magazines, these were almost exclusively erotic or fetish photography. Yoshiko's offer is an immediate red flag to the reader, though the protagonist is naive.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Chikei (笞刑):** Literally "Bamboo Flogging Penalty." An archaic legal term for corporal punishment, appropriated by the SM community to sound clinical and severe.
*   **Mochi (モチ):** Showa-era slang abbreviation for *Mochiron* (Of course). It adds a casual, street-smart texture to Yoshiko's dialogue, contrasting with Akiyo's polite speech.
*   **Shubun (醜聞):** Translated here as "scandalous rumors." In the context of a girls' school in this literature, this usually implies sexual delinquency, enzyme associations, or lesbianism ("Class S" relationships).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Trap of Innocence:** The story sets up the "pure victim" archetype (long black hair, ribbon, poor but beautiful) being led astray by the "corrupted peer" (Yoshiko).
*   **Fetishization of Hair:** The text explicitly highlights the value of "long black hair" (kurokami). In *Kitan Club* context, hair is often a primary fetish object, sometimes involving hair-cutting (torture) or hair-binding.
*   **Economic Coercion:** Akiyo is lured not by vanity, but by poverty ("didn't have the spare money for a perm").
*   **Foreboding:** The reassurance "It's not nude, I guarantee it" is an ironic trope. In this genre, if it's not nude, it is likely something more perverse (bondage, torture, suspension), which technically adheres to the "no nudity" rule while being more extreme.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Genre:** SM Literature / Showa Pulp.
*   **Sexual Content:** Implied (Fetishism).
*   **Violence:** Implied (Title "Flogging" guarantees future violence).
*   **Themes:** Recruitment/Trafficking, Hair Fetishism, Schoolgirls, Economic Vulnerability.
