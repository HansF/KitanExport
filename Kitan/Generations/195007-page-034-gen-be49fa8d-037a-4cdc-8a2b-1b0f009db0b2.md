　　四、隣室の秘密工場

およそ、一、二分間の沈黙が続きました。
そして壁から耳を離した由紀子は、
「ねえ、大変よ」
と口走って、僕の身体をぐっと自分へ引き寄せ、彼女の口を僕の耳へ近づけて、
「秘密工場の設計者たちが隣にいるのよ。ええ、二人らしいわ。そいつらが今、こんな話をしていたのよ――25になる五尺八寸の太った女を買い入れたんですって。その女の背中へ二十八、九の、ごく背の小さい男をくっつける相談をしているの」
「えっ？ 小さい男を？」
「だめよ、大きい声を出しては。言うことが憎らしいわ。『大きな女の尻っぺたへ小さい男をくっつけて、その奇形動物を現代人に見せることは利口な興行法だ。現代人は激しい変異と刺激を求めているんだから、こいつは高く売れる』――こう言っているのよ」
「憎たらしい」
「君、小さい男と言ったね？」
僕は恐ろしい不安を感じ出しました。なぜなれば、僕は五尺そこそこの小男だったからです。
「まさか僕のことを狙ったわけじゃないだろうね？」
「それがね、あなた――」
彼女の目が恐怖に震えて、
「隣の部屋にいる小男が、ちょうど君に似通っているの」
「えっ、僕を？」
「だめよ、あなた騒いでは。――気づかれたらもうおしまいよ。お座りなさい」
「君、逃がしてくれ、頼む」
「今逃がしてあげる。落ち着きなさい」
「あ、驚いたね。20世紀の今日、都会の真ん中に人間を奇形にして儲けようという設計工場があるなんて――君、どこから逃げよう」
「だからさ、ねえ、あなた。もう決してこんな所へ来ちゃだめよ。お金持ちでもないくせに、とんでもない享楽や刺激を求めるなんて間違っているわ。さあ――」
と彼女は、部屋の西南角の床板を指差して、
「その床板を上げてごらんなさい。そこから逃げられます――」
僕は慌てて床板を上げました。湿った妙な悪臭のある冷たい空気が、吹き上げてきました。僕はもう、その穴の中へ半身を入れました。
「気をつけていらっしゃい。真っ暗な抜け道の所々に屍（しかばね）がありますから、驚かずに約二十丁行けば焼跡の草原へ出ますから――」
僕は床板を頭の上で押さえながら、最後の言葉を彼女に投げかけました。
「ありがとう、すまなかったね」
バタン、と元通り床板を閉めて、僕は真っ暗なじめじめとした石垣の間の細道を一散に走りました。幾度か、柔らかい氷のような冷たい固まりを踏み越え、水たまりをじゃぶじゃぶ走って、しかも、背後の足音の発生に極度の恐怖に怯えながら、転んだり、這ったり、倒れたりしながら……。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Then?"
"Yes, outside the door or beyond the wall, in this room the situation listening might be, I think."
So she, on the bed with an risen body, toward the right-hand wall her ear inclined and intently listened, but—
"Oh?"
Her complexion to pale changed. I was startled.
"You, did something happen?"
"Be silent, please."

    4. The Secret Factory in the Next Room

Approximately, one or two minutes of silence continued.
And from the wall ear removed Yukiko,
"Hey, it's serious,"
so blurted out, my body 'gut' toward herself pulled, her mouth my ear toward approached,
"Secret factory's designers next door are in, yes, two people it seems, those guys now this kind of talk were doing—a 25 year old, 5 shaku 8 sun fat woman bought they say—on that woman's back, a 28 or 29 year old, extremely height small man to attach, consulting they are doing."
"Eh? A small man?"
"No, big voice if you put out—the things they say are hateful. 'To a big woman's buttocks a small man attach, that deformed animal to modern people showing is a clever showmanship method. Modern people intense mutation and stimulation are seeking, so this guy high will sell'—thus saying they are."
"Hateful."
"You, 'small man' said, right?"
I a terrifying anxiety began to feel. Because I was a 5 shaku thereabouts small man.
"Surely my place (me) aiming a reason isn't there, right?"
"That is, you—"
Her eyes in terror trembling,
"The small man who is in the next room, exactly to you is resembling."
"Eh, me?"
"No, you, making a noise. —If noticed, it's already the end. Sit down."
"You, let me escape, I beg."
"Now I will let you escape. Calm down."
"Ah, surprised, isn't it? In the 20th century today, in the middle of the city, humans into deformities turning and profit making 'design factory' exists—You, from where shall we escape?"
"That's why, hey, you. Already never to this kind of place come, must not. Even though not a rich person, ridiculous pleasure or stimulation seeking is wrong. Now—"
And she, the room's southwest corner floorboard pointed at,
"That floorboard try raising. From there you can escape—"
I in a hurry the floorboard raised. Damp strange bad smell having cold air blew up. I already, into that hole my half-body put.
"Careful be going. In the pitch-dark escape path, here and there corpses exist, so without being surprised, about 20 cho if you go, the burned-out ruins' grassland to you will come out—"
I the floorboard above my head while pressing, the last words to her threw.
"Thank you, sorry I was."
'Batan,' with, as before the floorboard closed, I in the pitch-dark damp stone wall between narrow path at full speed ran. Several times, soft ice-like cold lumps stepping over, puddles splash-splash running, and, behind me footsteps' occurrence at extreme terror being frightened, falling, crawling, collapsing while doing...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"What is it?"
"Shh... someone might be listening to us from outside the door or through the wall," she whispered.
Yukiko sat up on the bed and pressed her ear against the wall to her right, listening intently. Suddenly, her face went deathly pale. My heart skipped a beat.
"Is something wrong?" I asked.
"Be quiet!" she hissed.

    IV. The Secret Factory Next Door

Silence hung in the air for a minute or two. Finally, Yukiko pulled her ear away from the wall.
"This is terrible," she murmured, pulling me close and pressing her lips to my ear. "The men who design for the 'secret factory' are in the next room—there are two of them. They were just talking about how they’ve purchased a fat woman, twenty-five years old and nearly five feet eight inches tall. They’re planning to graft a tiny man, around twenty-eight or twenty-nine, onto her back."
"What? A small man?"
"Hush! Keep your voice down. It’s sickening what they’re saying. They think that showing a 'human freak'—a small man attached to a large woman's backside—is a brilliant way to draw a crowd. They say modern people crave bizarre mutations and thrills, so they can sell the attraction for a fortune."
"How disgusting."
"Did you say a 'small man'?" A wave of terror washed over me. I was, after all, a small man myself, barely five feet tall. "You don't think... they're after me?"
"That's just it," she said, her eyes trembling with fear. "The small man they have in the next room... he looks exactly like you."
"Me? They want me?"
"Stop it, don't make a scene! If they catch us, it’s all over. Sit down!"
"You have to let me out of here! Please!"
"I'll help you escape. Just stay calm."
"I can't believe this... in the middle of a 20th-century city, a 'design factory' that turns people into monsters for profit? Yukiko, how do I get out of here?"
"Listen to me. You must never come to a place like this again. You aren't a rich man; it’s wrong for you to go chasing after these twisted pleasures and cheap thrills. Now, go—"
She pointed to the floorboards in the southwest corner of the room.
"Lift those boards. You can escape through there."
I scrambled to pry the boards up. A damp, foul-smelling draft of cold air rushed up to meet me. I lowered the lower half of my body into the dark hole.
"Be careful," she warned. "There are corpses scattered along that pitch-black passage. Don't let them startle you. Keep going for about two kilometers, and you'll come out in the fields by the ruins."
Holding the floorboard over my head, I called out one last time.
"Thank you... and I'm sorry."
With a thud, I pulled the board shut and began to run blindly through the pitch-black, narrow passage between stone walls. My feet trampled over soft, ice-cold lumps that felt like flesh. I splashed through puddles, paralyzed by the sound of footsteps behind me. I stumbled, crawled, and fell, pushing onward in a frenzy of terror...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is formatted in traditional Japanese vertical columns (tategaki), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-20th-century printing. It uses some older kanji forms (kyūjitai) and non-standard kana usage (large kana for small 'tsu').
*   **Illustration:** A rough, expressive ink drawing depicts a man in a state of high distress or shock, with his hand to his face. The style is reminiscent of "gekiga" or pulp magazine illustrations of the era, focusing on psychological tension.
*   **Section Header:** The chapter title "四、隣室の秘密工場" (4. The Secret Factory in the Next Room) is centered vertically, creating a clear break in the narrative.
*   **Page Numbering:** The number "-35-" appears at the bottom, suggesting this is a page from a serial or a collection of short stories.
*   **Ending Mark:** The character "(了)" (End) indicates the conclusion of the story or chapter.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The "Yakeato" (Burned-out Ruins):** The mention of escaping to the "焼跡" (yakeato) firmly places the setting in post-WWII Japan (late 1940s to early 1950s). Large portions of Japanese cities were vast fields of rubble following Allied firebombing.
*   **Ero-Guro Nonsense:** This story belongs to the "Erotic-Grotesque" genre, which flourished in the 1920s-30s (Edogawa Rampo era) and saw a gritty revival in "Kasutori" magazines after the war. These stories often featured body horror, secret societies, and urban depravity.
*   **Modernity and Stimulation:** The text explicitly mentions "modern people seeking intense mutation and stimulation." This reflects the social anxiety of the time—a feeling that traditional values had collapsed and people were numb, seeking ever-more extreme distractions in the "Pan-pan" (prostitution) districts and underground theaters.
*   **Measurement Units:** The text uses "Shaku" and "Sun."
    *   1 Shaku ≈ 30.3 cm (approx. 1 foot).
    *   1 Sun ≈ 3.03 cm (approx. 1.2 inches).
    *   The woman is "5 shaku 8 sun" (approx. 175 cm), which was exceptionally tall for a Japanese woman at the time, adding to her "freakish" description. The narrator is "5 shaku" (151 cm), which was short even then.
*   **Distances:** "Twenty Cho" (二十丁). One *cho* is about 109 meters, so 20 cho is roughly 2.2 kilometers.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **廿五 (Nijū-go):** An archaic/formal way of writing 25.
*   **五尺八寸 (Go-shaku hachi-sun):** Traditional Japanese units of length.
*   **奇形動物 (Kikei dōbutsu):** "Deformed animal" or "freak animal." Used here to describe the intended "human chimera."
*   **興行法 (Kōgyō-hō):** Showmanship or the business of public performance/entertainment.
*   **屍 (Shikabane):** Corpse. A literary and visceral term.
*   **一さんに (Issan ni):** Usually written as 一散に. It means at full speed or headlong.
*   **じめ／＼ (Jime-jime):** Onomatopoeia for damp, clammy, or gloomy. The "／＼" is an iteration mark.
*   **じゃぶ／＼ (Jabu-jabu):** Onomatopoeia for splashing through water.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Body Horror and Dehumanization:** The core horror stems from the idea of humans being treated as raw material for "design" and profit. This reflects a post-war cynicism where human life felt cheap.
*   **The "Small Man" Complex:** The protagonist's fear is tied to his physical stature. There is a subtext of physical inadequacy and the fear of being "consumed" or "remodelled" by a cruel, larger society.
*   **Social Morality:** The woman (Yukiko) scolds the narrator for seeking "pleasure and stimulation" despite not being rich. This suggests a class-based moralizing—the idea that the underground world is a trap for those trying to escape their mundane, impoverished lives.
*   **Claustrophobia vs. The Void:** The escape goes from a cramped room to a narrow, corpse-filled tunnel, finally leading to the "ruins"—a literal and figurative void. There is no "safe" space; the choice is between a factory of horrors or a wasteland of death.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Fiction.
