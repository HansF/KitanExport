21 文学に現れた女の腹裂き

柳眉「ええ、情けないことで……」
というわけで、柳条は大きなまな板に縛り付けられる。もっとも、最後には雷震が現れて助けてしまうので、腹を裂かれる場面は表現されていない。

武烈天皇や、豊臣秀次に関しては、こうした文献はあまりなく、ただ『日本書紀』や『太閤記』に「妊婦の腹を裂いた」ということが書いてあるだけである。
『日本野史』には、
「（武烈天皇が）かつて外出して妊婦を遠くに見て言った。『昔、胎内を切り開いた者がいたと聞く。その楽しみは想像に難くない』と。そこで側近に命じて言った。『速やかに引き連れてこい』と。一人が駆けて追いつき、婦人の耳に寄せて『ただ、ひっそりと逃げなさい』と言った。そして道端の麦の穂を握り、戻って報告して言った。『これは麦わらを懐に入れていた者で、孕んでいたのではありません。ゆえに、私は謹んで一掴みの麦を持ち帰り、これを証拠といたします』と。こうして婦人は危ういところで逃れることができた。」
とあり、女が助かったことしか書いていない。
『野史』にはこれとほとんど同じ記事で、松平忠直卿のことが書かれている。だから、どの程度信用できるか分からない。

しかし、小説として書かれたものの中には、必ず腹裂きの場面が出てくる。
古いものでは、昭和五年、日本評論社から出版された松崎実著『殺生関白行状記』（バテレン見聞録）には次のように書かれている。
「『これまでは秀次、人を斬る腕前ばかりを見せてきたが、今こそは生殺自在の神技を見せよう。宣教師の言うデウスの偉大な力にも勝る妙力だ』と、ある日突然におっしゃった。（中略）
関白様は振り返って『あの淫乱な女を庭前に引き出せ』とおっしゃった。
引き立てられて出てきたのは、大奥に数え切れないほどいる女房衆の一人で……（中略）……月が満ちるほど（臨月）に見える腹を抱えて庭先に据えられると……（中略）……
『ならば秀次が、その腹を改めてやろう。』やがて下人を呼んで、『お許しください、お許しください』と身悶え叫ぶ女を無理やり裸にし、仰向けに押し倒し、喉元を片足で踏みつけ、まず一突き、鳩尾（みぞおち）のあたりに突き立てれば、たちまち息絶えたが、その刃を抜きもせず、切っ先で下腹の果てまで裂き下ろし、胎児を掴み出して、

21 Belly-slitting of Women as Appeared in Literature

Ryubi: "Eh, what a wretched thing..."
For such a reason, Ryujo is tied to a large cutting board. However, in the end, Raishin appears and saves her, so the scene where the belly is slit is not expressed.

Regarding Emperor Buretsu and [Toyotomi] Hidetsugu, such documents are not many, and it is only written in *Nihon Shoki* or *Taikoki* that they cut open the bellies of pregnant women.
In *Nihon Yoshi*, it says:
"Once going out, [he] saw a pregnant woman from afar and said: 'I hear that in ancient times there was one who cut open the womb. That pleasure can be imagined.' Therefore, he ordered his attendants, saying: 'Bring her here quickly.' One person ran and reached her, and whispered in the woman's ear: 'Just go away quietly.' Then [he] grasped the ears of wheat by the roadside, and returning to report, said: 'This person was carrying wheat straw in her bosom and was not pregnant. Therefore, I respectfully took a handful to prove this.' Thus, the woman was in danger but escaped."
So it is written, and it only says the woman was saved. In the *Yoshi*, almost the same article is written about Lord Tadanao. Therefore, it is unknown to what extent it can be trusted.

However, among things written as novels, the belly-slitting scene always appears.
Among old ones, in the "Record of the Conduct of the Killing Regent" (*Satsushō Kanpaku Gyōjōki*) (Jesuit Accounts) by Minoru Matsuzaki, published by Nihon Hyoronsha in Showa 5 [1930], it is written as follows:
"'Until now, Hidetsugu has only shown the skill of cutting people, but now I shall show a divine technique of life and death at will, a mysterious power that surpasses even the great power of the Lord (Deus) spoken of by the Jesuits,' he suddenly declared one day. (Omitted)
The Regent, looking back, said: 'Drag that lewd woman out to the garden.'
The one dragged out was one of the countless ladies-in-waiting in the inner palace... (Omitted) ...When she was placed in the garden holding a belly that appeared to be at full term... (Omitted) ...
'Then Hidetsugu shall examine that belly.' Presently, calling a servant, he forced the woman, who was writhing and screaming 'Forgive me, forgive me,' to be stripped naked, pushed her down on her back, stepped on her throat with one foot, and first thrusting once near the solar plexus, her soul instantly vanished, but without even removing the blade, he slit down to the end of the lower abdomen with the tip, grabbed the fetus out, and shouted:
'Are the women not here? Quickly give this child its first bath and examine whether it resembles Hidetsugu or not!'"

What was written based on this book is "The Killing Regent" in Renzaburo Shibata's *The End of a Young Warrior* (Kadokawa Shoten).
"'Forgive me! Forgive me!'
From the lady-in-waiting who was writhing and struggling, he forcibly stripped her garments one by one, made her naked, and waiting for her to be pushed down on her back, the Regent grasped his sword and,
'You adulteress! Did you think the eyes of this Hidetsugu were blind!'
Along with the rebuke, her throat was firmly stepped on with one foot, and first, with one thrust, the solar plexus was pierced through with a 'puttsuri' sound.
Instantly, the lady-in-waiting's soul vanished, but to the Regent..."

**21: Depictions of the Dissection of Women in Literature**

Ryubi sighed, "Oh, how truly wretched..."
And so, Ryujo finds herself bound to a massive chopping block. Fortunately, at the final moment, Raishin arrives to rescue her, spared the reader the graphic details of her being cut open.

Historical records regarding the infamously cruel Emperor Buretsu or the Regent Toyotomi Hidetsugu are sparse. Works like the *Nihon Shoki* and *Taikoki* mention only briefly that they "ripped open the bellies of pregnant women."
However, the *Nihon Yoshi* recounts the following:
"Once, while out, the Emperor spotted a pregnant woman in the distance. He remarked, 'I have heard that in ancient times, there were those who cut open the womb. I can only imagine the thrill of it.' He ordered his attendants to bring her to him at once. One attendant raced ahead, reached the woman, and whispered in her ear, 'Flee, and be silent about it.' He then gathered some ears of wheat from the roadside. Returning to the Emperor, he reported, 'This woman was merely carrying wheat straw in her robes; she is not pregnant. I have brought this handful as proof.' Thus, the woman narrowly escaped a grisly fate."
Since this account ends with the woman being saved—and because a nearly identical story is told regarding Lord Matsudaira Tadanao in the same chronicles—its historical reliability is questionable.

In fiction, however, the scene of the "belly-slit" is a recurring trope.
A notable early example is Minoru Matsuzaki’s 1930 work, *Record of the Conduct of the Killing Regent* (subtitled *Jesuit Accounts*). It contains the following passage:
"One day, Hidetsugu suddenly declared, 'Until now, I have merely shown you my skill with the blade. Now, I shall demonstrate a divine mastery over life and death—a power that eclipses even the 'Great Deus' preached by the Jesuits.' He then ordered an 'adulterous woman' from among his many attendants to be dragged into the garden. She was heavily pregnant, her belly swollen as if ready to give birth.
'Let us see what Hidetsugu finds inside,' he sneered. Ignoring her desperate pleas for mercy, he had his servants strip her bare and pin her to the ground. Planting his foot firmly on her throat, he drove his blade into her solar plexus. She died instantly. Without withdrawing the sword, he dragged the tip down through her abdomen, reached in, and pulled out the fetus. 'Where are the maids?' he bellowed. 'Bathe this child at once and tell me: does he look like me or not?'"

Renzaburo Shibata later used this text as the basis for his story "The Killing Regent," featured in the collection *The End of a Young Warrior*. Shibata writes:
"'Mercy! Have mercy!' the woman shrieked, struggling as her robes were torn from her body piece by piece. Once she was pinned naked on her back, the Regent gripped the hilt of his sword. 'Adulteress! Did you think Hidetsugu’s eyes were blind to your sins?' With a sharp cry, he crushed her throat under his boot and plunged his blade deep into her solar plexus. The woman’s life vanished in a heartbeat, but for the Regent, the act was far from finished..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography:** The text uses a standard Mid-Showa era Mincho typeface. The use of furigana (rubi) is frequent for historical terms and names (e.g., `胎` read as `こはら`, `速` as `すみやか`).
*   **Layout:** The page features a vertical orientation (tategaki). There is a decorative header at the top with the page number "21" and the chapter title. A small, stylized illustration sits above the title, though its exact subject is ambiguous (possibly a stylized floral or abstract pattern).
*   **Structure:** The text is structured as a literary/historical essay. It begins with a dialogue or commentary (Ryubi), moves into historical citations (*Nihon Shoki*, *Nihon Yoshi*), and concludes with comparisons of modern fictional accounts (Matsuzaki vs. Shibata).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is centered at the top. The body text is dense, with indentation used for block quotes from historical or fictional texts, helping the reader distinguish between the author's analysis and the source material.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Emperor Buretsu (武烈天皇):** Traditionally reigned in the late 5th century. In the *Nihon Shoki*, he is depicted as a "tyrant" who enjoyed cruelty, including the specific act mentioned here: cutting open pregnant women to inspect their fetuses. Modern historians often view these accounts as "legitimization" tropes used to justify the transition to the next imperial line (Emperor Keitai).
*   **Toyotomi Hidetsugu (豊臣秀次):** The nephew and successor of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He was famously dubbed the "Satsushō Kanpaku" (殺生関白 - The Killing Regent) due to rumors of his extreme cruelty, which included random street killings and the execution of his own household. This text reflects the "Black Legend" surrounding him.
*   **Shibata Renzaburo (柴田錬三郎):** A major figure in post-war Japanese popular literature, famous for *kengo* (swordsman) fiction and "Cruel Tales" (*Zankoku Monogatari*). His work often blended historical fact with sensationalist gore.
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense):** This text belongs to a tradition of Japanese publishing that explores the macabre and the transgressive. The fascination with "belly-slitting" (*hara-saki*) is a recurring motif in *zankoku* (cruelty) literature of the 1950s and 60s.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **腹裂き (Hara-saki):** Literally "belly-splitting." It refers to the non-ritual, violent act of cutting open the abdomen, as opposed to *Seppuku* (ritual suicide).
*   **殺生関白 (Satsushō Kanpaku):** "The Killing Regent." A derogatory nickname for Toyotomi Hidetsugu. *Satsushō* refers to the Buddhist sin of taking life.
*   **伴天連 (Bateren):** From the Portuguese *padre*. Used in the Sengoku and Edo periods to refer to Jesuit missionaries/priests.
*   **野史 (Yoshi):** "Unofficial history" or "private history." These were historical accounts written outside of the official government chronicles, often containing more sensational or anecdotal material.
*   **鳩尾 (Mizoochi / Kyūbi):** The solar plexus. A common anatomical target in Japanese martial arts and historical violence descriptions.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Historical Cruelty vs. Fiction:** The author explores the gap between historical records (which are sparse or skeptical) and literature (which indulges in the details). The text suggests that while history might "save" the victim (as in the *Nihon Yoshi* account), literature "demands" the gore.
*   **Misogyny and Power:** The violence is specifically gendered. The victims are "adulterous" or "lewd" women, and the act of slitting the belly—the site of reproduction—is the ultimate assertion of patriarchal/tyrannical power.
*   **Sensationalism:** The detailed description of the murder (stepping on the throat, the "puttsuri" sound of the blade) indicates that the text aims to thrill or shock the reader, a hallmark of the *zankoku* genre.
*   **Religious Superiority:** Hidetsugu’s boast that his "divine technique" surpasses the power of the "Jesuit God" (Deus) highlights a theme of secular/tyrannical power challenging spiritual authority.
