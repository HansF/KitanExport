**(R Column, Block 1)**
Again appeared the state of the dignified daughter,
This month, let us relate a story so bizarre it takes flight.
Fifth-year A group and B group are dogs and monkeys [enemies],
That these days the relationship between them is worse than between capitalists and laborers
is not a thing that started only yesterday or today.
Boku [male self-reference]... ah, no,
I am the fighting general of A group, that is, the Labor Struggle Committee Chairman,
The leader of B group is Eishitsu Keiko-san,
and [she] has a beautiful face and good grades,
And her family is a currently popular newspaper 'Pull' [journalist],
and she is the greatest enemy because she has also appeased the teachers.
I, with full strength, opposing the educational aristocracy
who add special favoritism, heredity, and grades [to their power] based on reality,
[aim for] the establishment of a democratic nation, and political/educational vengeance.

**(Center Columns, Block 2 - The Incident)**
The rumor of disposition and expulsion of staff and students,
Since the conflict had been settled,
This is about something that happened in May,
The situation had progressed into a war.
The start of the incident was Aoba Dorm, one afternoon,
At the Kyoto Student Drama Contest.
Teacher Toga
Was suspected of drinking, there was that possibility,
But he was not found at all in the infirmary.
When I entered, the school doctor and Teacher Mizoguchi were there.
"What?" I thought, but still didn't understand. Then that Mizoguchi (teacher said):

**(Text wrapping around illustration)**
"Regarding this girl, we received an internal report that she seems
to be infected with syphilis (ume) from somewhere,
So if it is fact, since it is a misfortune [scandal],
Could you please investigate it once?"
He said to the school doctor. "Oh, no!"
When I realized it must be the scheme of Donako [Narration/Rage Child], it was already too late.
I and Teacher Toga already,
At the time of the post-war situation, I and Teacher Toga already,
The school doctor who knew nothing was already in bloomers [gym wear].

**(L Column continuation)**
[He] had taken off [his uniform] and was listening. Toga was listening with a deaf-like face.
However, surely in his heart, he was snickering.
As proof of that, he was showing his backside [or sticking out his hips].
I was taken to Heian Hospital along with Pan, Pan's Pan,
and though I have no experience encountering the same kind of examination as a former man's conscription physical,
Such a thing is a secret within the school, yes.
Because, when it came to the school doctor, seeing this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
He stared, pinched, inserted fingers, and gave me a terribly painful time.
Since it was the time for gymnastics, on a piece of paper that came with a shirt,
I, still in my shirt, somehow immediately went to the neighboring office room.
If it were the teacher's room, yesterday's comrade students and...

Lipstick Girl Student Memoirs Series
The Dynamics of Ultra-Pink Horsepower
Kayo Kiyoko

**Main Text:**

**(R Column, Block 1)**
The distinguished girl has appeared again, and this month, let me share a story that is extraordinarily bizarre.
The rivalry between fifth-year A Group and B Group is like that of cats and dogs—worse these days than the feud between capitalists and laborers—though this hostility is nothing new. I, serving as A Group's champion, the Labor Struggle Committee Chairman, face our greatest rival in B Group's leader, Eishitsu Keiko. She is beautiful, brilliant, and her family uses the influence of the current popular press to sway the teachers. I am committed to fighting the educational aristocracy who exploit grades, lineage, and special favors, striving for the establishment of a democratic nation and the reversal of oppressive school governance.

**(Center Columns, Block 2 - The Incident)**
The conflict concerning the rumored punishment and expulsion of staff and students escalated into an actual battle in May.
The incident began one afternoon at Aoba Dorm during the Kyoto Student Drama Contest.
Teacher Toga was suspected of drinking, and there were reasons to believe this. When I looked for him in the infirmary, he was nowhere to be found.
But when I entered, the school doctor and Teacher Mizoguchi were there. "What is going on?" I wondered, still confused. Then Mizoguchi said to the school doctor:

**(Text wrapping around illustration)**
"This girl, it seems we have an internal report that she may be infected with syphilis from somewhere. If this is true, it is a serious disgrace, so could you please conduct an investigation?"
The school doctor nodded. Oh, no! By the time I realized this must be Donako’s scheme, it was already too late.
In this post-war environment, Teacher Toga and I... the unsuspecting school doctor was already in his gym clothes.

**(L Column continuation)**
He had shed his coat and was intently listening. Toga pretended to be completely deaf to the conversation. But surely, deep down, he was snickering. The proof was in the way he was consciously thrusting out his hips.
I was taken to Heian Hospital along with [my companions], and although I have never been subjected to a humiliating physical examination akin to the conscription tests once forced upon men, that sort of thing is kept entirely secret within the school walls.
The school doctor, seeing this as a golden opportunity, gazed, pinched, inserted his fingers, and caused me terrible, prolonged pain.
Since it was during gymnastics period, I received a small note with a shirt. Still in my shirt, I immediately hurried to the adjacent office room.
If this were the teacher’s room, yesterday’s comrades would be...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

This text appears to be an excerpt from a serialized confessional or sensationalistic memoir published in a popular magazine or weekly paper, likely targeting an adult audience interested in scandalous youth activities and social critique.

**Format and Structure:**
1.  **Title Block:** A prominent, multi-tiered title introduces the series ("Lipstick Female Student Conduct Record Series") and the specific episode's sensational theme ("Ultra Pink Horsepower," *Chō Momoiro Bariki*), set in large, bold script. The author, Kayo Kiyoko, is named beneath the image.
2.  **Layout:** The text utilizes a traditional vertical (tategaki) reading format, flowing from right to left across three columns. The layout is highly dynamic, wrapping closely around a large central illustration.
3.  **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration dominates the central space, drawing immediate attention. The stylized, brush-script characters superimposed on the image further emphasize the sensational core theme. The main body text is small and dense, typical of magazine articles prioritizing content volume.
4.  **Illustration:** A black-and-white line drawing depicting a woman, possibly nude or minimally clad, in a dramatic, emotionally heightened pose, hands raised, head tilted back. This visual heavily emphasizes the "pink" (erotic/sensational) aspect mentioned in the subtitle.
5.  **Typography/Orthography:** The text employs *kyūjitai* (old-form kanji) and *rekishiteki kanazukai* (historical kana usage, e.g., ゐる, あつた). This suggests a publication date prior to the full implementation of postwar orthography reforms (pre-1946, or, more likely, a publication defying the reforms or dating from the immediate post-war era, roughly 1945–1955, when such usage was still common in popular press). Parenthetical numbers (e.g., (2)) mark sectional breaks.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Era Classification (1940s-1960s):** The content strongly suggests the immediate post-World War II period through the mid-1950s. References to "democratic nation establishment" (民主主義國樹立), "political/educational vengeance" (學政復讐), and the term "post-war period" (戦後の際) point to the socio-political turbulence of the Allied Occupation (1945–1952) and the subsequent decades, characterized by democratization and strong student activism.

**Student Radicalism and Class Conflict:** The mention of "Labor Struggle Committee Chairman" (労働闘争委員長) and the rivalry between "A group" (implied anti-establishment/pro-labor) and "B group" (implied pro-establishment/educational aristocracy) reflects the intense ideological conflicts prevalent in Japanese universities and high schools during this time, often tied to the Japan Communist Party or socialist movements. Student movements frequently opposed institutional authority represented by teachers and administrators.

**The "Lipstick Student" (口紅女生):** The title frames the protagonist as a modern, possibly rebellious or sexually liberated female student, contrasting with the conservative image of the traditional Japanese *josei* (woman). The term *kōbeni* (lipstick) symbolizes modernization and transgression of traditional gender roles in educational settings.

**The Scandal (梅毒/Syphilis):** The introduction of an alleged syphilis infection (*baidoku* or *ume*) and the resulting forced "investigation" (investigation that turns into sexual assault by the school doctor) is a sensational plot device common in *kasutori* culture or low-brow popular magazines of the immediate post-war era. The fear of STDs was high, and linking it to rebellious students was a way to generate shock value and moral critique, often veiling an erotic narrative under the guise of exposure and confession. The comparison of the physical exam to a "military conscription physical" (徴兵検査) emphasizes the invasive, degrading, and state-like brutality of the school administration's action.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**The Conflation of Politics and Sex:** The text masterfully uses the politically charged atmosphere of post-war student struggle (A vs. B group, democracy vs. aristocracy) as a dramatic vehicle to introduce a deeply personal and scandalous narrative—the rumored syphilis infection and the subsequent invasive medical examination. The "Ultra Pink Horsepower" title suggests the driving force behind the narrative is not just ideology, but raw, suppressed sexuality and scandal.

**Anti-Authoritarianism and Corruption:** The narrator, a self-identified anti-establishment leader, frames the school authority (the school doctor, Teacher Mizoguchi) as corrupt, aristocratic, and exploitative. The medical examination is not portrayed as a legitimate health measure but as a humiliating abuse of power, confirming the narrator's critique of the "educational aristocracy." The school doctor is described as treating the examination as a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" for voyeurism and assault, reinforcing the theme that authority figures are morally bankrupt.

**Narrative Reliability and Tone:** The tone is intensely confessional, dramatic, and outraged ("Oh, no!," "It was already too late!"). However, the language is highly sensationalized (e.g., "bizarre story," "dogs and monkeys"). The text is designed to evoke moral shock and sympathy for the protagonist while capitalizing on the erotic undercurrents of the forced physical examination.

**Subtext of the Rivals:** The rival, Eishitsu Keiko (B Group leader), is characterized as beautiful, successful, and politically powerful through her media connections. The implied suggestion that the alleged syphilis infection was a "scheme" by her faction (怒鳴子さんの策略) suggests that sexual scandal is being weaponized in the student political conflicts.
