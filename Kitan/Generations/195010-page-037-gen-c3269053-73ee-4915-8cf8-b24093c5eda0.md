**韓國密航者哀話**
**捕えられた密入國者**
**階堂三次郎**

韓國人李玄羊は、十二年間住馴れた日本と戀人が忘れられず五月十三日の夜、同志十五名と共に小さな帆前船をあやつり途中幾度か海甍に會いつゝもようやく山陰の沖合まで漕ぎつけた。
それは本國を發してから八日目の夜の十時頃であつた。十五名のうち三名は、今年の冬一度日本へ密入國を企て直ちに日本の警察に捕えられ本國に送還された密航の経験者だつた。
トランプ占いが吉と出て、そこで早速彼等は運を天に任せてしずかに船を海岸へと進めた。曇天なので、海岸の砂濱がわずかにほの白く見えているだけだ。最近とみに警戒がきびしくなつたと聞いているので、はやる同志を靜めながら頭分の三人は愼重に事を運んだ。

やつとなつかしの日本の地を踏んだのが午後十一時頃、三名を除いた十二人はほつと安堵の色を見せたが、危いのはこれからだと知っている三人は、こゝで結束を解いて各人思いの場所へ逃げて行く事を言い含め、叢勢のからだに鞭打つて散り〜に別れて行つた。
李玄羊の戀人は三里ばかり隔つた倉吉に住んでいる。その町には彼のよく知っている同國人も住んでいる。汽車はもうないし、またあつても捕えられる危險が大であるから、彼は夜を徹して町へ急いだ。
未明のうちにどうしても町へ着かねばならない。町へ行きさえすれば、彼をかくまつてくれる同國人の家はいくらでもある。戀人は癩病の父を持つ日本人で、豐子といつて彼女よりは五つ年下の醜い女であつた。公然と渡航出來るようになるまで彼を待つていてくれる約束をしていた。その彼女のむつちりとふくらんだ肢体を想い浮べながら李玄羊は暗い道を急いだ。
朝の空が明けだした頃、彼はやつと町外れまで辿りついた。戀人の家も、同國人の家ももうすぐだ。
棒のようになつた足を引きずつて、先づ同國人の家を叩いた。この前捕つたのは大阪行きの汽車の中であつたが今度はもうこゝまで來た以上は捕りはしないだろうと彼は思つた。
日本に居るとき、兄弟のように親しくしていた同國人は心よく迎え、捕えつた様子もないので、日本へ來てから初めて町を歩いて見た。意識して胸をそらした。
夜だつた彼は戀人の家を訪ねた。豐子は困つた顔つきを一瞬して見せたが喜びに有頂天になつている彼はそれに気付かなかつた。
その夜はそこに泊り、眼の見えぬ中風の老婆を隣りにして何月ぶりに忘れぬ女の肌に觸れてみたかつた。
が他に愛人の出来た女は、普通通りの満足を與えてはくれなかつた。
彼は、變つた彼女に気がつくと、言い知れぬかなしみに襲われた。何のために日本にやつて来たのか、彼自身にもわからぬような気持になつて来た。
滿されぬ煮立しい心で彼は滿潮をひつかむつて壁を立てずに泣きぬれた女は、彼に背を向けて寝ていた。その背からは何か冷いものが李玄羊には感じられるのだった。彼女は大阪に行けば以前彼に振られた同國人の女が居る筈であつた。

その次の夜、あまり気が進まなかつたが彼は最後の氣持で戀人に會いに行つた。彼女は前夜よりもやや喜びの色を見せた。然しそれは彼女の偽りであつた。靴を脱ぎ終つた頃、五人の武装警官がいきなり踏み込んで来たのだ。
謀られた！　と思つたがもう遅かつた。女の顔を見ると、嘲笑している感じがぴんと來た。
警官は、寄つてたかつて手錠をはめた。
彼は、抵抗をする氣持さえなく警官のなすまゝに任していた。本國に送還されても、彼は日本の國に心残りはなかつた。強いてあるといえば、昔振つた同國人の女に會えぬことくらいであつた。
彼は聲をあげて泣いた。そうしなければ胸の中の空漠さは埋められなかつた。泣きながら、（十四人の同志よ、何處にでも逃げてくれ、最後まで逃げてくれ）と叫んでいた。
李玄羊はやがて夜の町を、五人の警官に守られてよろめくように歩いて行くのだつた。

**韓国密航者哀話**
**捕らえられた密入国者**
**階堂三次郎**

韓国人の李玄羊（リ・ゲンヨウ）は、12年間住み慣れた日本と恋人が忘れられず、5月13日の夜、同志15名と共に小さな帆前船を操り、途中幾度か荒波に遭いながらも、ようやく山陰の沖合まで漕ぎ着けた。
それは本国を発してから8日目の夜の10時頃であった。15名のうち3名は、今年の冬に一度日本への密入国を企て、直ちに日本の警察に捕らえられ本国に送還された密航の経験者だった。
トランプ占いが吉と出て、そこで早速彼らは運を天に任せて静かに船を海岸へと進めた。曇天なので、海岸の砂浜がわずかにほの白く見えているだけだ。最近特（とみ）に警戒が厳しくなったと聞いているので、はやる同志を鎮めながら、リーダー格の3人は慎重に事を運んだ。

やっと懐かしの日本の地を踏んだのが午後11時頃、3名を除いた12人はほっと安堵の色を見せたが、「危ないのはこれからだ」と知っている3人は、ここで結束を解いて各人思い思いの場所へ逃げて行くことを言い含め、疲労困憊の体に鞭打って散り散りに別れて行った。
李玄羊の恋人は三里（約12km）ばかり隔たった倉吉に住んでいる。その町には彼のよく知っている同国人も住んでいる。汽車はもうないし、またあっても捕らえられる危険が大であるから、彼は夜を徹して町へ急いだ。
未明のうちにどうしても町へ着かねばならない。町へ行きさえすれば、彼をかくまってくれる同国人の家はいくらでもある。恋人はハンセン病（癩病）の父を持つ日本人で、豊子といって、彼よりは5つ年下の醜い女であった。公然と渡航できるようになるまで彼を待っていてくれる約束をしていた。その彼女のむっちりと膨らんだ肢体を思い浮かべながら、李玄羊は暗い道を急いだ。
朝の空が明けだした頃、彼はやっと町外れまで辿り着いた。恋人の家も、同国人の家ももうすぐだ。
棒のようになった足を引きずって、まず同国人の家を叩いた。「この前捕まったのは大阪行きの汽車の中であったが、今度はもうここまで来た以上は捕まりはしないだろう」と彼は思った。
日本にいたとき、兄弟のように親しくしていた同国人は快く迎え、捕まる様子もないので、日本へ来てから初めて町を歩いてみた。意識して胸を張った。
夜になって彼は恋人の家を訪ねた。豊子は困った顔つきを一瞬見せたが、喜びに有頂天になっている彼はそれに気付かなかった。
その夜はそこに泊まり、目の見えない中風（ちゅうぶう）の老婆を隣にして、何ヶ月ぶりに忘れぬ女の肌に触れてみたかった。
だが、他に愛人のできた女は、普通通りの満足を与えてはくれなかった。
彼は、変わってしまった彼女に気がつくと、言い知れぬ悲しみに襲われた。「何のために日本にやって来たのか」、彼自身にもわからぬような気持ちになってきた。
満たされない煮えくり返る心で、彼は布団を引っかぶって、声も立てずに泣き濡れた。女は彼に背を向けて寝ていた。その背中からは何か冷たいものが李玄羊には感じられるのだった。彼女は「大阪に行けば以前彼に振られた同国人の女がいるはずだ」と言った。

その次の夜、あまり気が進まなかったが、彼は最後の気持ちで恋人に会いに行った。彼女は前夜よりもやや喜びの色を見せた。しかし、それは彼女の偽りであった。靴を脱ぎ終わった頃、5人の武装警官がいきなり踏み込んできたのだ。
「嵌められた！」と思ったが、もう遅かった。女の顔を見ると、嘲笑している感じがピンときた。
警官は、寄ってたかって手錠をはめた。
彼は、抵抗をする気持ちさえなく警官のなすがままに任せていた。本国に送還されても、彼は日本の国に心残りはなかった。強いてあると言えば、昔振った同国人の女に会えぬことくらいであった。
彼は声を上げて泣いた。そうしなければ胸の中の空虚さは埋められなかった。泣きながら、「（14人の同志よ、どこにでも逃げてくれ、最後まで逃げ切ってくれ）」と心で叫んでいた。
李玄羊はやがて夜の町を、5人の警官に護送されてよろめくように歩いて行くのだった。

**Korean Stowaway Sad Tale**
**The Captured Illegal Entrants**
**Kaidō Sanjirō**

Korean man Lee Ji-yang, [because] the 12 years lived-in Japan and lover could not be forgotten, on May 13th night, with 15 comrades together a small sailboat operated, [and] while mid-way many times encountering sea-waves, finally to the San'in offshore rowed-to.
It was about 10:00 PM on the 8th night since departing the home country. Among the 15, three were stowaway experienced persons who in this year's winter once planned illegal entry to Japan and immediately by Japan's police were captured and to home country deported.
Card fortune-telling came out as good, and there immediately they left luck to heaven and quietly the ship toward the coast advanced. Because it was cloudy, the coast's sandy beach only slightly faintly white was visible. Because they heard recently especially vigilance has become strict, while calming the eager comrades, the 3 head-men carefully matters handled.

Finally the nostalgic Japan's land stepped-on was around 11:00 PM, excluding the 3 people the 12 people a "phew" relief color showed, but knowing "the dangerous part starts now" the 3 people, here the unity dissolving, to each person's desired place escaping-to-go told-thoroughly, and to the exhausted bodies whipping, separately they went.
Lee Ji-yang's lover about 3 *ri* (12km) separated Kurayoshi lives in. In that town his well-known fellow-countrymen also live. Trains no longer [run], and even if they were, the danger of being caught is great, so he through the night to the town hurried.
Within pre-dawn by all means to the town must arrive. If only going to the town, fellow-countrymen's houses that shelter him are many. The lover is a Japanese with a leprosy-suffering father, called Toyoko, and than him 5 years younger ugly woman was. Until becoming able to openly cross-the-sea, the promise to wait for him she had made. While the image of her plumply swollen body imagining, Lee Ji-yang the dark road hurried.
Around the time the morning sky began to dawn, he finally the town outskirts reached. The lover's house, fellow-countryman's house also soon.
Dragging legs that had become like sticks, first the fellow-countryman's house he knocked. "The time before being caught was inside the train for Osaka, but this time since coming this far, being caught probably won't happen," he thought.
When in Japan, a fellow-countryman he was close with like brothers heartily welcomed [him], and since there was no sign of being caught, for the first time since coming to Japan the town he tried walking in. Consciously his chest he puffed out.
At night he visited the lover's house. Toyoko a troubled face for a moment showed, but he who was in ecstasy with joy did not notice it.
That night staying there, with the blind palsy-suffering old woman next [door], for the first time in months the unforgettable woman's skin he wanted to touch.
But the woman who had made another lover, normal satisfaction did not give.
He, upon noticing the changed her, by unspeakable sadness was attacked. "For what purpose to Japan did I come?" even to himself not knowing-like feeling he became.
With an unsatisfied boiling heart, he pulling the quilt over [himself] without making a sound cried-drenched. The woman with her back toward him was sleeping. From that back something cold to Lee Ji-yang was felt. She said, "If you go to Osaka, the fellow-countrywoman whom you dumped before should be there."

The next night, although not feeling very up to it, with a final feeling he went to see the lover. She than the night before a slightly more joyful color showed. However, that was her lie. Around the time he finished taking off his shoes, five armed policemen suddenly stepped in.
"I was framed!" he thought but already late. Looking at the woman's face, a ridiculing feeling came sharply.
The police, ganging up, put on handcuffs.
He, even the feeling to resist without, as the police did left it. Even if deported to home country, he toward the country of Japan no lingering regret had. If forced to say, it was only not being able to meet the fellow-countrywoman he dumped long ago.
He raised his voice and cried. If not doing so, the emptiness inside his chest could not be filled. While crying, (Comrades of 14, to anywhere please escape, until the end please escape) he was shouting.
Lee Ji-yang soon the night town, guarded by five policemen, stumbling-like was walking.

**A Sad Tale of a Korean Stowaway**
**The Captured Illegal Entrant**
**By Kaidō Sanjirō**

Unable to forget the twelve years he had spent in Japan or the woman he loved, a Korean man named Lee Ji-yang set out on the night of May 13th. Together with fifteen comrades, he manned a small sailboat, and despite several brushes with the crashing waves, they finally managed to row into the waters off the San’in coast.
It was approximately 10:00 PM on the eighth night since leaving their homeland. Three of the fifteen were experienced stowaways who had attempted to enter Japan illegally that winter, only to be caught immediately by the police and deported.
A reading of the cards had promised good fortune, so they left the rest to fate and quietly steered their vessel toward the shore. Under a leaden sky, the sandy beach was visible only as a faint, pale glimmer. Hearing that surveillance had become particularly strict of late, the three leaders cautiously managed the operation, calming their more impulsive comrades.

It was around 11:00 PM when they finally set foot on the nostalgic soil of Japan. While twelve of them breathed a sigh of relief, the three leaders—knowing that the true danger was only beginning—ordered the group to disband. They instructed everyone to flee to their respective destinations and, pushing their exhausted bodies to the limit, the group scattered in all directions.
Lee’s lover lived in Kurayoshi, about twelve kilometers away. He also had acquaintances among his countrymen living in that town. Since the trains had stopped running—and the risk of being caught on one was high anyway—he hurried toward the town on foot through the night.
He had to reach the town before dawn. Once there, he knew there were many fellow Koreans who would hide him. His lover, a Japanese woman named Toyoko, was five years his junior. Though not conventionally beautiful and burdened with a father suffering from leprosy, she had promised to wait for him until the day he could return to Japan legally. Lee hurried along the dark road, his mind filled with the memory of her soft, full body.
As the morning sky began to break, he finally reached the outskirts of town. Both his lover’s house and his friend’s home were close now. Dragging his stiff, leaden legs, he first knocked on the door of his fellow countryman. "The last time I was caught, it was on a train bound for Osaka," he thought. "Surely, now that I’ve made it this far, I won't be caught again."
The man, whom Lee had treated like a brother during his time in Japan, welcomed him warmly. Seeing no sign of pursuit, Lee ventured out into the streets for the first time since his arrival, consciously puffing out his chest with a sense of relief.
That night, he visited Toyoko. For a fleeting moment, she looked troubled, but Lee, intoxicated with the joy of their reunion, failed to notice. He stayed the night, hoping to finally touch the skin of the woman he had never forgotten, even with her blind, paralytic mother in the adjacent room.
But Toyoko, who had taken another lover in his absence, would not give him the intimacy he craved. Realizing how much she had changed, Lee was struck by an unspeakable sorrow. He began to feel a hollow confusion, wondering why he had even bothered to return to Japan.
With a heart boiling with unfulfilled longing, he pulled the quilt over his head and wept silently. Toyoko slept with her back turned to him—a back that felt cold and distant. She coldly remarked that if he went to Osaka, he could probably find the Korean woman he had dumped years ago.

The following night, though his heart was no longer in it, Lee went to see her one last time. She appeared slightly more welcoming than the night before, but it was a deception. Just as he finished taking off his shoes, five armed policemen burst into the room.
"I’ve been betrayed!" he realized, but it was too late. Looking at Toyoko’s face, he saw a unmistakable glimmer of mockery. The police swarmed him and snapped on the handcuffs.
Lacking even the will to resist, Lee let the officers do as they pleased. Even if he were deported again, he felt he had no regrets left for Japan. If anything, his only lingering thought was that he hadn't seen the Korean woman he had rejected long ago.
He wailed aloud; it was the only way to fill the sudden, vast emptiness in his chest. As he wept, he cried out in his heart, "Comrades, all fourteen of you—please escape! Run as far as you can!"
And so, Lee Ji-yang was led away through the night streets, stumbling as he was escorted by the five policemen.
(The End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a standard vertical orientation (tate-gaki), reading from right to left. It follows a multi-column format typical of Japanese magazines from the mid-20th century.
*   **Typography:** The title uses a larger, bolder typeface to draw attention. The author's name is placed below the title in smaller font. Furigana (reading aids) are used sparingly for certain kanji like 癩病 (raibyō) and 肢体 (shitai), suggesting a general adult readership.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "Sad Tale of a Korean Stowaway" (韓國密航者哀話) is the primary focal point, followed by the sub-header "The Captured Illegal Entrant." The illustration serves as a visual hook, placed in the center to break up the dense text.
*   **Illustration:** The drawing depicts a classic "film noir" or "melodrama" aesthetic. The man (Lee) looks weary and distressed, while the woman (Toyoko) has a somewhat detached or calculating expression. The presence of the sake bottle and the traditional room setting emphasizes the domestic yet strained nature of the scene.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "(87)" is visible at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger periodical.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Repatriation and "Mikkō" (Illegal Entry):** Following Japan's defeat in 1945, hundreds of thousands of Koreans who had been in Japan (many forcibly brought as laborers) were repatriated to the Korean Peninsula. However, due to the chaotic economic and political situation in Korea (leading up to the Korean War), many attempted to return to Japan—where they had lives, families, or better economic prospects—illegally by boat. This phenomenon was known as *mikkō* (密航).
*   **Social Status of Koreans:** The text reflects the marginalized status of Koreans in post-war Japan. Lee relies on a network of "fellow countrymen" (同國人) for shelter, highlighting the segregated or tight-knit nature of the Zainichi Korean community during this era.
*   **Leprosy (Hansen's Disease):** The mention of Toyoko's father having *raibyō* (leprosy) is a significant social marker. In that era, leprosy carried a massive social stigma in Japan, often leading to the ostracization of entire families. This detail suggests that Toyoko herself was from a marginalized background, perhaps explaining why she was Lee's "ugly" lover or why they were a "match" in a society that looked down on both.
*   **Chūbū (中風):** This term refers to paralysis or the after-effects of a stroke. The "palsy-suffering old woman" adds to the grim, impoverished atmosphere of the setting.
*   **San'in Region:** The "San'in" coast (Shimane/Tottori prefectures) was a common landing point for boats coming from the Korean Peninsula due to its geographical proximity across the Sea of Japan. Kurayoshi is a city in Tottori Prefecture.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **哀話 (Aiwa):** Literally "sad tale." This was a common trope in magazines of the time (like *Kasutori* magazines), which featured sensationalized, tragic "true stories" involving crime, romance, and hardship.
*   **密航 (Mikkō) / 密入國 (Mitsunyūgoku):** Stowaway / Illegal entry. These were highly charged political and social terms in the late 40s.
*   **帆前船 (Homaesen):** A sailing ship/schooner. Indicates the primitive/dangerous methods used by stowaways.
*   **山陰 (San'in):** A region on the Sea of Japan coast of Honshu.
*   **三里 (San-ri):** An old unit of distance. 1 *ri* is roughly 3.9 km, so 3 *ri* is about 12 km.
*   **有頂天 (Uchōten):** Being in high spirits, ecstatic, or on cloud nine.
*   **空漠 (Kūbaku):** Vast, empty, or hollow. Used here to describe Lee's emotional state after betrayal.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Betrayal and Disillusionment:** The central theme is the "cruel reality" that awaits those who try to reclaim a past that no longer exists. Lee risks his life for a woman who has moved on and eventually betrays him to the authorities.
*   **The "Coldness" of Japan:** There is a subtext of Japan being a cold, unwelcoming place for Koreans after the war. The "cold back" of the woman and the "armed police" represent a state and society that has turned its back on people like Lee.
*   **Fatalism:** The use of card fortune-telling (トランプ占い) and "leaving luck to heaven" (運を天に任せて) emphasizes a sense of fatalism common in this genre of literature.
*   **Gender and Class:** Toyoko is described as "ugly" and from a family with leprosy, yet she holds the power in the relationship because she is Japanese and on "home turf." Her betrayal is depicted as particularly cruel through her "mocking" expression.
*   **Melodrama as Social Critique:** While the story is melodramatic, it highlights the desperate lengths people went to in order to bypass post-war borders, and the breakdown of human connections in the face of poverty and legal pressure.
