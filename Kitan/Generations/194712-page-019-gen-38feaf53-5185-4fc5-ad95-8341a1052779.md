奇譚報告
性癖の手記
羞恥の遊戯 (ゲーム)
岩手県・花巻　読者　W・M子

夫は事業の失敗から酒に溺れ、私には暴力を振るうやうになつた。
私とて、いつまでもこんな生活は続けられぬ。けれど、別居する経済力もない。
そんな折、私は奇妙な悦びを見つけた。
夜更け、酔つぱらつた夫を寝かせた後、そつと家を抜け出し、近所の公衆便所の前へ行く。
そして、誰もゐないのを確認して、私は上衣と下着を脱ぎ捨て、全裸になる。
公衆便所といふのは、男達が用をたす為の場所であり、いつ誰が来るやうにも知れない。
その場所の冷たいタイルに、私は膝をつき、両乳房を掌で隠すやうなポーズをとる。
暫くすると、必ず酔客か、さもなくば夜勤明けの男が寄つて来る。
男の驚愕の表情と、私の全身に走る羞恥と恐怖の混ざつた震え。
これが、私の唯一の救ひであつた。
だが、一月前の真冬の夜、遂に事が起きた。
私は、通りかかつた若い巡査に、現行犯で発見されてしまつたのだ。
私は泣きながら許しを乞うたが、彼は淡々としてゐた。
その時、私の背後で、あの男達が笑つてゐた。

Strange Tale Report
Manuscript of Sexual Habits
The Play (Game) of Shame
Iwate Prefecture, Hanamaki Reader W. Miko

My husband, due to business failure, drowned himself in sake, and started using violence against me.
Even for me, I cannot continue this life forever. However, I have no economic means to separate.
It was then that I discovered a strange pleasure.
Late at night, after putting my drunken husband to sleep, I quietly slipped out of the house and went to the front of the neighborhood public toilet.
And, confirming that no one was there, I discarded my outerwear and underwear, becoming completely naked.
The public toilet is a place for men to relieve themselves, and it is unknown when anyone might come.
On the cold tiles of that spot, I kneel down and strike a pose as if covering both my breasts with my palms.
After a while, inevitably, a drunkard or, failing that, a man just off the night shift will approach.
The man's expression of shock and the mixed tremor of shame and fear running through my entire body.
This was my only salvation.
But, one month ago, on a deep winter night, the incident finally occurred.
I was discovered in the act (caught red-handed) by a young patrolling policeman who happened to pass by.
I cried and begged for forgiveness, but he remained calm and detached.
At that moment, behind me, those men were laughing.

A Report of the Bizarre
A Confession of Sexual Deviation
The Game of Shame
W. Miko, Reader, Hanamaki, Iwate Prefecture

Following his business failure, my husband became a hopeless alcoholic and started subjecting me to violence.
I knew I couldn't sustain this life indefinitely, yet I lacked the financial means to leave him.
It was during this crisis that I discovered a strange source of pleasure.
Late at night, after putting my drunken husband to bed, I would quietly sneak out of the house and walk to the public restroom nearby.
After confirming the area was deserted, I would strip off my outerwear and underwear, standing completely nude.
The public restroom is a place where men go to relieve themselves; you never know who might arrive at any moment.
On the cold tiles of that spot, I would kneel, adopting a pose as if shielding my breasts with my palms.
Before long, inevitably, either a drunken reveler or a man finishing his night shift would approach.
The man’s look of utter shock, combined with the tremor of shame and terror that coursed through my entire being—
This was my sole form of salvation.
However, one deep winter night, a month ago, the inevitable happened.
I was caught in the act by a young patrolling policeman who chanced upon me.
I wept and pleaded for mercy, but he remained utterly impassive.
At that moment, I could hear those men laughing behind me.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Confession / Pseudo-ethnography structured as a letter (奇譚報告, Strange Tale Report). This category serves to publish sensational or deviant accounts allegedly submitted by the readership.
*   **Author Attribution:** Anonymous (W. Miko), identified only by initials and gender marker (子, *ko*), attributed to a specific provincial location (Iwate Prefecture, Hanamaki). This structure enhances the authenticity required for the confessional genre.
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** The narrative is entirely in the first-person confessional voice, outlining the psychological etiology (abuse and poverty) that led to the development of the sexual deviation (exhibitionism/masochism).
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Appeals directly to readers interested in sexual pathology (性癖), the intersection of domestic hardship and transgression, and the thrill of exposure and public humiliation.
*   **Positioning within the magazine:** Found on page 32, likely in the dedicated section for reader-submitted ero-guro accounts, offering a mix of domestic drama, urban folklore, and sexual scandal.

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Shōwa Era Context:** The narrative foundation—a husband’s business failure (事業の失敗) leading to alcoholism and domestic violence—reflects the social anxieties and economic volatility of postwar Japan (1950s–1960s). The lack of economic independence for the wife (W. Miko) traps her in the abusive situation.
*   **Sexual Mores and Deviation:** The act described is Exhibitionism (露体趣味) coupled with a strong element of Masochism, where the "pleasure" (悦び) is derived specifically from the shock of the male viewer and the narrator's own visceral experience of shame and fear (羞恥と恐怖). This concept aligns perfectly with the ero-guro genre's fascination with pain and deviation.
*   **The Public Restroom (公衆便所):** A notorious location in Showa-era urban environments for anonymous, transgressive sexual behavior. The cold, impersonal setting (冷たいタイル) and the presence of low-status male figures (酔客, 夜勤明けの男) emphasize the narrator’s degradation and the clinical nature of her self-punishment.
*   **Legal Implication:** Being caught by a policeman (巡査) as a "現行犯" (caught in the act of public indecency) grounds the event in reality, but the officer's "淡々としてゐた" (calm and detached) reaction is used narratively to intensify the psychological impact of the humiliation rather than focusing on the legal consequences.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **性癖 (Seiheki):** Sexual habit; deviation; fetish. A key term in this genre, used to categorize non-normative sexuality under a pseudo-scientific lens.
*   **羞恥の遊戯 (Shūchi no Yūgi):** The game/play of shame. *Yūgi* elevates the passive act of exhibitionism into a voluntary performance or ritualized pursuit of humiliation.
*   **公衆便所 (Kōshū Benjo):** Public toilet/restroom. Used specifically to evoke a location of anonymity and transgressive sexual activity, distinct from private domestic space.
*   **悦び (Yorokobi):** Joy, pleasure. Used here as a euphemism for intense psychological or sexual satisfaction derived from a taboo act.
*   **やうになつた (Yō ni natta) / ゐる (Iru):** Examples of Historical Kana Usage (歴史的仮名遣い), standard for print media in the mid-20th century.

## Themes & Subtext
*   **Transference of Pain:** The narrator transfers the violence and oppression received from her husband onto the public sphere, seeking a form of self-inflicted ritualistic punishment or psychological release that she controls.
*   **Agency through Vulnerability:** Her act of extreme vulnerability (kneeling, hiding breasts with palms) in a dangerous, public male space is paradoxically an attempt to gain agency, transforming the passive victimhood of domestic violence into active, if masochistic, performance.
*   **The Male Gaze and Punishment:** The narrative focuses intensely on the reaction of the male viewers (驚愕の表情; laughing men). Her salvation (救ひ) comes directly from being the object of this horrified and then mocking gaze. The discovery by the policeman serves as the narrative climax—the ultimate, inescapable judgment.
*   **Ero-Guro Archetype:** The story perfectly fits the *Kitan Club* fascination with the dark side of domesticity, where social failure and moral decay manifest as psychological sexual aberration.

## Content Classification Tags
*   Sexual content: High (Exhibitionism, Nudity, Fetishism)
*   Violence: Moderate (History of spousal abuse)
*   Coercion: Low (Act is voluntary but motivated by prior coercion/abuse)
*   Medical / bodily themes: Moderate (Psychological deviation classified as 性癖)
*   Taboo or illegal implications: High (Public indecency, caught red-handed)
