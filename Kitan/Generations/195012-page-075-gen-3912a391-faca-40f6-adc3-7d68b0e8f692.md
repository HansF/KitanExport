**Isshotei Shujin (Master of the Smile Pavilion)**
**(Art) Sone Saburo**

**Episode 1**
**The Bear's Palm**

**I**
Mrs. Hisako, despite being from a shabby countryside [background], somehow graduated from an old-system girls' school and married the current elementary school instructor, Mr. Nobuo, but whether a period of lassitude has arrived in their long years of married life, lately the husband's attitude is somehow distant.
As for her, he is her most beloved husband, and from the ease of having no children, in order to please her husband, she repeats all-out services, but the husband's response to this is merely perfunctory, and for her, who is of peerless stamina, it was a great dissatisfaction.
Does a fat woman not give birth to children? — The body of Mrs. Hisako, 5 shaku 1 sun and 14 kan 300 monme, was shining with health nearly bursting. Receiving this super-body together every night, no matter what kind of hero [one is], one would end up withered.

(Side note: Meanwhile, Mrs. Hisako had concluded that the reason for her husband's coldness was because of not having children.)

**II**
She heard from a close farmer's wife in the neighborhood that if one does a night pilgrimage to the Tenjin-sama of Mt. Shinobu for three-sevens, twenty-one days, there would be an effect, and she became convinced.
"Hey, dear. Is it okay if I do it? It's nothing [difficult]."
"Well, it's not like going to the peak, and the shrine is around the mountainside, so it's not like you can't go. Do you still believe in such simple things?"
A faint smile is floating on Mr. Nobuo's lips. Mrs. Hisako became a "miffed" face,
"About my business, please leave it to me."

After Mrs. Hisako went out, Mr. Nobuo, who had been silent for a while, suddenly stood up and, with his dressing [only] halfway done, followed after the lady.
Mt. Shinobu is a small hill not reaching 300 meters, and on the mountainside there was a Tenjin-sama that was just barely there.
There is no shrine office or anything, only the main hall and a torii gate exist lonely. In this main hall, the village youths often bring in girls or creepy vagrants lay around. To such a foolish point, even though [she has been] naive lately, having let his wife go out carelessly, Mr. Nobuo regretted it.
In general, this mountain village is a place of terribly bad public morals; secret affairs and adultery are just like buying and eating manju or senbei, and the talk of the young men is filled with sex and women. "Since the rear of the wife of so-and-so is good, when I crawled in last night, I bumped into the master, and I forgot my loincloth and fled flying," or "Whose seed is the belly of the girl at the pass?" "Kisaku is the most persistent fellow, so..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Variety Show: Reader's Choice**

**By Isshotei Shujin**
**Illustrated by Saburo Sone**

**Chapter 1: The Bear’s Paw**

**I**
Despite her humble rural origins, Hisako had managed to scrape through an old-regime girls' high school before marrying Nobuo, a local primary school teacher. Perhaps the spark had simply died after years of marriage, but lately, Hisako found her husband’s behavior increasingly cold and distant. 
She adored him, and since they were unburdened by children, she went to great lengths to please him. However, his responses to her "enthusiastic services" were merely perfunctory—a source of immense frustration for a woman of Hisako's boundless sexual energy.
Was it true that "plump women are barren"? At five-foot-one and nearly 120 pounds, Hisako’s frame practically radiated bursting health. To face such a formidable physical specimen every night would cause even the mightiest warrior to wilt in exhaustion.

(Note: For her part, Hisako was convinced that her husband’s coldness stemmed solely from their lack of an heir.)

**II**
Having heard from a local farmwife that a twenty-one-day night pilgrimage to the Tenjin Shrine on Mt. Shinobu would yield results, Hisako was determined to try it.
"Listen, dear," she said. "I’m going to do it. It’s no trouble at all."
"Well," Nobuo replied, a thin smirk playing on his lips, "it’s not exactly a climb to the summit, and the shrine is only halfway up, so I suppose you could manage. But do you really still believe in such nonsense?"
Hisako’s face hardened into a pout. "Just leave my business to me, will you?"

Once she had departed, Nobuo sat in silence for a time before suddenly springing up. Tossing on his coat, he hurried out after her.
Mt. Shinobu was a modest hill, less than three hundred meters high, with a meager little shrine perched on its side. It lacked even a basic administrative office; there was nothing but the main hall and a solitary torii gate. It was the sort of place where village rowdies lured girls or where unsavory vagrants spent the night. Nobuo cursed his own carelessness for letting his wife wander off alone to such a disreputable spot.
The village was, in truth, a moral vacuum. Affairs and trysts were treated with no more gravity than buying a snack at a street stall. The local youths spoke of nothing but sex, boasting loudly of their exploits: "That wife over there has a fine set of curves, so I snuck in last night, but the husband caught me! I ran off so fast I forgot my loincloth!" or "I wonder whose 'seed' is in the belly of that girl from the mountain pass? My money’s on Kisaku—he’s a persistent devil..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Format:** The page follows the standard layout for Japanese magazines of the mid-20th century. It features vertical text (tategaki) arranged in columns. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "お好みバラエティ" (Okonomi Variety) is rendered in a large, stylized hand-drawn font on the right, decorated with floral motifs. The chapter title "第１話 熊の掌" is encased in a decorative box featuring a bear's paw print, creating a strong visual anchor.
*   **Illustrations:** A prominent, suggestive illustration of a reclining, partially nude woman occupies the bottom right, a hallmark of "Kasutori" (pulp) magazines designed to attract male readers. The artist, Sone Saburo, was a well-known illustrator for these types of publications.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard Mincho-style typeface. Small side notes (marginalia) are used to provide internal character thoughts or plot context.
*   **Segmentation:** The story is divided into numbered sections (I, II), which was a common way to serialize short, punchy fiction.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** This text likely dates to the late 1940s or early 1950s (the "Kasutori" era). The term "旧制の女学校" (Old-system girls' school) refers to the education system before the 1947 reforms, suggesting the characters grew up in the pre-war or wartime era.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** Named after a cheap, poor-quality shochu, "Kasutori magazines" were low-budget publications that flourished during the post-war occupation. They focused on "3S" (Screen, Sex, Sports) and provided escapist, often eroticized or humorous content to a population recovering from the war.
*   **Mt. Shinobu and Tenjin-sama:** "Tenjin" refers to Sugawara no Michizane, the deity of scholarship, but folk belief often associated specific local shrines with fertility or the granting of wishes. The "3x7=21 day" pilgrimage is a traditional Buddhist/Shinto practice for making a serious vow (*gan-kake*).
*   **Measurements:** The text uses the *shaku-kan* system (五尺一寸, approx. 154cm; 十四貫三百, approx. 53.6kg). In that era, a woman of this weight and height was considered "plump" (肥満) or exceptionally well-built compared to the malnourished post-war average.
*   **Moral Landscape:** The depiction of the village as "morally loose" reflects a common literary trope in Japanese fiction where rural areas are depicted as places of uninhibited (and often crude) sexuality, contrasting with the refined (but often repressed) urban or "teacher" class.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **水臭い (Mizukusai):** Literally "smelling of water." It means distant, cold, or acting like a stranger toward someone who should be close.
*   **精力絶倫 (Seiryoku Zetsurin):** "Peerless energy/stamina." In this context, it heavily implies a high sex drive or physical robustness.
*   **凹垂れてしまう (He kotarete shimau):** Usually written as 凹たれる. It means to lose heart, to wilt, or to be physically exhausted. Here, it is a humorous double entendre for the husband's sexual exhaustion.
*   **三七、二十一日の夜詣り (San-shichi, niju-ichi nichi no yomairi):** A 21-day night pilgrimage. This specific number is considered auspicious in Japanese folk religion for the fulfillment of prayers.
*   **私通、姦通 (Shitsu, Kantsu):** Adultery and secret affairs. *Kantsu* was a legal crime in Japan until 1947, which adds a layer of "naughtiness" to the text if published around that transition.
*   **種 (Tane):** Literally "seed." It is used colloquially (and crudely) to mean paternity or semen.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Sexual Frustration & Marital Ennui:** The core theme is the mismatch between a physically robust, sexually active wife and a tired, perhaps intellectually aloof husband. 
*   **The "Vampire" Trope:** There is a subtle subtext common in humor of the time where the "healthy" wife is portrayed as a sort of succubus who drains the "meager" husband's energy (the "bear's paw" might imply her heavy-handed or powerful physicality).
*   **Superstition vs. Modernity:** The husband (a teacher, representing modern education) mocks the wife's reliance on folk religion (the pilgrimage), yet he is the one who ends up worried about the "base" reality of the village's loose morals.
*   **Class & Origin:** The wife's "shabby" country background and "old system" education are mentioned to establish her character as someone who values traditional roles (like providing an heir) but possesses a "raw" physical vitality that the civilized husband cannot match.
