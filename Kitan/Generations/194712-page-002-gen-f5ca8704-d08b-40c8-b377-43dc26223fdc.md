三ツ目の秘密（三重縣・花岡）

私の夫は、普段はごく普通の公務員であります。しかし、彼は奇妙な嗜好を抱いてゐます。それは、人が自分を見てゐる中、或は、大勢の人の前で、私の着物や下着を、手まめに、ゆっくり剥ぎ取ることであります。この羞恥プレイは、初めは家の中だけでありましたが、最近は、旅行先の旅館の広間や、海水浴場の更衣室など、人が多く居る場所を好むやうになりました。

先日、私は旅先で、夫に命じられるまま、浴衣を剥がれ、肌襦袢と腰巻だけの姿で廊下を歩かされました。その時、向ふから来た若い仲居さんが、ギヨッとして目を逸らしたのです。私は顔を覆ひたかったけれど、夫はそれを許さなかった。私は、この背徳的な悦びに、少しずつ慣れてしまってゐる自分が怖ろしいのです。

## Literal English Translation
The Third Secret (Mie Prefecture, Hanaoka)

My husband, ordinarily, is a very normal civil servant. However, he harbors strange tastes. That is, while people are watching us, or perhaps, in front of a large number of people, he manually, slowly strips away my kimono and underwear. This Shame Play, initially, was only within the home, but recently, he has come to prefer places where many people are present, such as the grand hall of a traveling inn or the changing room of a bathing beach.

The other day, while traveling, commanded by my husband, I was stripped of my yukata and made to walk down a corridor in only my *juban* slip and *koshimaki* loincloth. At that time, a young maid coming from the opposite direction was shocked (Giyo!) and averted her eyes. I wanted to cover my face, but my husband did not permit it. I am terrified of the self who is gradually growing accustomed to this immoral pleasure.

## Literary English Translation
The Third Secret (Hanaoka, Mie Prefecture)

My husband is, generally speaking, a completely ordinary civil servant. Yet, he holds strange and peculiar tastes. Specifically, he enjoys meticulously and slowly stripping me of my kimono and undergarments while others are watching us, or even in the presence of a large crowd. This 'Shame Play' (Shūchi Purei) initially remained within the confines of our home, but lately, he has begun to favor locations filled with people, such as the main halls of inns we visit or the changing rooms at bathing beaches.

Just recently, during a trip, I was ordered by my husband to have my *yukata* removed, and I was forced to walk along the corridor dressed only in my *juban* (under-kimono slip) and *koshimaki* (waist wrap/loincloth). A young chambermaid approaching us was visibly startled, quickly averting her gaze. I desperately wanted to hide my face, but my husband forbade it. I am now terrified by the fact that I am slowly becoming habituated to this depraved pleasure.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Letter / Confession / ‘Secrets’ Column. This genre was extremely popular in postwar magazines like *Kitan Club*, providing sensational content framed as authentic testimony.
*   **Author Attribution:** Pseudonymous reader, "Hanaoka," writing from Mie Prefecture. This setup reinforces the illusion of realism and distance from the editors.
*   **Editorial Voice:** The tone is entirely the narrator’s (the wife's), characterized by distress mixed with growing self-awareness and arousal—a typical trope for masochistic confession literature.
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in sexual deviance, fetishism (specifically exhibitionism/voyeurism), and the transgression of public vs. private boundaries. The focus on the shame felt by the "normal" wife increases the voyeuristic appeal.
*   **Positioning:** Likely placed centrally within a section dedicated to non-fiction confessions or reports on niche sexual practices involving humiliation and control.

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **The Civil Servant (公務員):** The husband's respectable profession establishes a stark contrast with his secret behavior, highlighting the strong societal pressure for outward propriety (*tatemae*) in post-war Japan, particularly in the Showa era.
*   **Shame Play (羞恥プレイ / Shūchi Purei):** While potentially an imported concept, it was heavily localized and sensationalized in Japanese pulp literature. It emphasizes the sexualization of shame, humiliation, and public exposure, which were major themes in the ero-guro movement.
*   **Traditional Garments and Vulnerability:** Being stripped down to the *hadajuban* (under-slip) and *koshimaki* (loincloth/waist wrap) in a public space (旅館の廊下 / inn corridor) represents a maximal transgression of modesty. These garments were historically private and associated with intimate female spaces, making their public display highly provocative and scandalous.
*   **Geographic Marker:** Using a location outside Tokyo (Mie Prefecture) further attempts to ground the confession in a realistic, non-metropolitan setting, perhaps suggesting that such deviance permeates even traditional, quiet regions.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **嗜好 (shikō):** Taste/preference/inclination. Used euphemistically to denote a sexual fetish or perversion.
*   **手まめに (temame ni):** Diligently, meticulously. Describes the care and precision the husband takes in stripping the wife, transforming the violent act of "剥ぎ取る" (hagitoru, to strip/peel off) into a focused, ritualistic performance.
*   **剥ぎ取る (hagitoru):** To strip off forcefully. Carries a stronger connotation of removal or violence than simply 脱ぐ (*nugu*, to take off).
*   **羞恥プレイ (Shūchi Purei):** Shame Play. A direct, loan-word concept used for sexual humiliation and exposure scenarios.
*   **背徳的な悦び (haitokuteki na yorokobi):** Immoral/depraved pleasure. The essential linguistic mechanism by which the narrator acknowledges her own psychological complicity and masochistic transformation.
*   **ギヨッとして (giyo-tto shite):** Onomatopoeia emphasizing sudden, visible shock or surprise on the part of the observing maid.

## Themes & Subtext
*   **Psychological Masochism:** The dominant subtext is the narrator's forced conversion from a resistant victim into a participant who finds "pleasure" (悦び) in her own degradation. Her terror is directed not at the husband, but at her own transformed self.
*   **The Voyeuristic Gaze:** The core dynamic relies on the presence of the "large number of people." The pleasure is derived entirely from being seen and violating the social contract of public space.
*   **Control and Agency:** The husband maintains absolute control, preventing the wife even from performing the minimal act of self-protection ("I wanted to cover my face, but my husband did not permit it"). This reinforces the power dynamic essential to BDSM.
*   **Modernity vs. Tradition:** The juxtaposition of the traditional Japanese garments (kimono, yukata, koshimaki) with the modern, clinical term "Shame Play" reflects the Showa era's tension between traditional social roles and rising awareness of modern sexualities and psychological concepts.

## Content Classification Tags

*   Violence: Low (Psychological coercion only)
*   Coercion: High (Explicit commands and prohibition of self-protection)
*   Medical / bodily themes: No
