## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

よろ／＼と、表戸によりかかり、じつと、光子の血の気の退いた、石像のような顔をみつめていると、やがて、熱い涙が、ボロボロと頰を傳つて、流れ落ちた。
　それは、甘い、想い出の涙であつた。
　始めて、光子に、恋を打ち開けたときの、始めて、接吻したときの、涙に似ていた。
　輪郭のはつきりした、白い歯をチラツと覗かせた小さな唇、豊かな頰、美しい眉の下に眠つている眼、
　信二は、そつと、頰ずりしてみた。白粉と、髪油と、女の匂いが、甘つたるく、胸をうづかせる。
「光子ッ！——おおい、いとしい光子ッ！ 死んだつて——囃すものか、死んだつて——」
　信二は、光子の、柔い胴を、力一ぱい抱き締め、唇を、瞼を、頰を、気狂いのように吸った。
　おや？ 変な匂いがする？ 生臭い、舌で、唇を舐め、光子から顔を離してみると。
　血ッ、血だッ！
　真つ白な、光子の、頰に、額に、血が、血がついている。
　自分の掌をみた。
「うわあッ！」
　血だらけだッ！ 掌も、袖口も、肢体まで、赤黒く、こつてりした液体が、べつとりと半乾きに、こびりついているのだ。
「逃げろッ！」
　どこでもいい、みつかつたら最後だ。
　光子を背負つて、逃げるのだ。
　信二は、やつと、餅網工のように、ぐにゃ／＼の光子を背にすると、戸を開けて、表へ出た。幸い、人影もない、薄暗い夜道だ。
　どこへゆこう——山でも、川でも、線路でもいい、静かに、死ねるところだつたなら——。

　　　五. 朝風の唄

　信二は、がむしやらな力で、背負つてきた光子を降ろすと
「光、光子さんッ！」
　肩を播つて絶叫した。
　きら／＼光つている田圃に、蛙が鳴いて、湖の晶は、静かな明るい月夜であつた。
「あツ！ 信二さんッ」
　光子は、ハツと正気づいて、大きな眼を開いた。キヨロ／＼として、激しく泣き出し、かばづと、信二にしがみついてきた。
　信二は、気狂いのように、光子をかき抱いた。
　そして、二人は、おい／＼と、いつまでも泣き続けた。
「もう——とりかえしがつかない——」
　信二は、この、光子の肉体も、可愛いい眼元も、唇も、永遠に、かろうじてしつかりと手に触れることもできなくなるのかと思うと、急に、死が、怖くなつた。
　ああッ！ 嫌だッ！、死にたくない死にたくない。
「光子さんッ！ 僕は、僕は、どうしたらいいんだッ！」
　信二は、熱い涙を流して叫んだ。
　光子は、しいんと瞳を据えた。そして突然、激しい口調でいつた。
「馬鹿ッ！ 信二さんの馬鹿ッ！——あたしのお父さんは、あなたのことも、すつかり知つて——あたしが話したの、お父さんは、いいひと、とつてもいいひとよ、怒つたりなんかしな位で、惚れ合つたふたりなら、こんな結構な話はないと、いづれ、あなたのお母さんには、話にゆくつていつてたのよ、それなのに——それなのに、あなたは——ああッ——」
　光子は、気がふれたように、肩を震わせて泣いた。
　信二は、愕然とした。
　血の気が、さつと退いて、全身が寒気がふる／＼と、止めどなく震えた。
「あ、ああ——そ、そうだつたのか」
　頭を抱え、からだを揺り、もだえ泣いた。
　薄墨色の連山は、こういう二人の悲しみなんか知らぬげに、かすかに、かすかに、明るく、夜明けの、清涼な、大気の中に、生々と姿を輝やかし始めた。

　柔い微風が、湖面に、叢に、そよ／＼と、夜の歌をかなでだした。
「あらッ、誰か、誰かくるわッ、警察の人ぢやないかしら？——あ、走つて、走つてくるわ」
　信二は、ドキリとして顔をたげた。
「おおいッ——信二いッ——」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Staggeringly, against the front door leaning, fixedly, Mitsuko's blood-color-receded, stone-statue-like face watching, soon, hot tears, drip-drip down the cheeks traveled, flowed down.
That was, sweet, memory's tears were.
First time, to Mitsuko, love confessed time's, first time, kissed time's, tears resembled.
Outlines clear, white teeth a-glimpse showing small lips, full cheeks, beautiful eyebrows under sleeping eyes,
Shin'ichi, softly, cheek-rubbing tried. Powder, and hair oil, and woman's scent, sugary-sweetly, chest made ache.
"Mitsuko! Hey, dear Mitsuko! Dead—am I teasing, even if [you are] dead—"
Shin'ichi, Mitsuko's, soft torso, with full strength hugged tight, lips, eyelids, cheeks, like a madman sucked.
Oh? Strange smell does? Raw-smelling. With tongue, lips licked, from Mitsuko face separated and tried looking.
Blood, blood is!
Pure white, Mitsuko's, on cheek, on forehead, blood, blood is attached.
His own palm looked at.
"Uwaa!"
Full of blood is! Palm also, cuffs also, even limbs, dark red, thick liquid, thickly half-dried, is clinging.
"Run!"
Anywhere is fine, if found it is the end.
Mitsuko on back carrying, run.
Shin'ichi, finally, like a mochi-net worker, limp-limp Mitsuko on back put, door opened, to the outside went. Fortunately, human shadows none, dim night road is.
Where shall go—mountain even, river even, railroad tracks even fine, quietly, could die place if it were—.

V. Song of the Morning Breeze

Shin'ichi, with reckless strength, the carried-on-back Mitsuko when lowered,
"Mitsu, Mitsuko-san!"
Shoulders shaking screamed.
In the sparkling-shining rice fields, frogs crying, the lake's surface was a quiet bright moonlit night.
"Ah! Shin'ichi-san"
Mitsuko, suddenly coming to senses, large eyes opened. Looking around, violently started crying, suddenly, to Shin'ichi clung.
Shin'ichi, like a madman, Mitsuko embraced.
And then, the two, wailing, forever continued crying.
"Already—cannot be undone—"
Shin'ichi, this, Mitsuko's body, cute eye-area, lips, eternally, barely firmly in hand touching also becoming unable to do or so when thought, suddenly, death, became scary.
Ah! No! Don't want to die, don't want to die.
"Mitsuko-san! I, I, what should I do!"
Shin'ichi, hot tears flowing, shouted.
Mitsuko, silently eyes fixed. And suddenly, with violent tone said.
"Fool! Shin'ichi-san you fool!—My father, about you too, completely knowing—I told him. Father is, good person, very good person. Angry or such without doing, if in love two people, this wonderful story none, eventually, to your mother, to go talk was saying. Despite that—despite that, you—ah—"
Mitsuko, like losing her mind, shoulders trembling cried.
Shin'ichi was shocked.
Blood color, quickly receded, whole body chill shiver-shiver, without stopping trembled.
"A, ah—so, that was it"
Head holding, body swaying, agonized-crying.
Pale-ink colored mountain range, such two people's sadness or such unknowing-like, faintly, faintly, brightly, dawn's, cool, atmosphere inside, vividly form shining began.

Soft breeze, on lake surface, in thickets, rustle-rustle, night's song began to play.
"Oh, someone, someone is coming, police person isn't it? —Ah, running, running they come"
Shin'ichi, with a throb, face raised.
"Hey—Shin'ichi—!"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Staggering against the front door, Shin’ichi gazed fixedly at Mitsuko’s face. It was as pale as a stone statue, drained of all color. Before long, hot tears began to spill, tracing paths down his cheeks. They were sweet tears, born of memory. They felt like the tears he shed the first time he confessed his love to her, or the first time they kissed.

He looked at her small lips, which parted just enough to reveal a glimpse of her well-defined white teeth, her full cheeks, and the eyes resting beneath her beautiful brows. Shin’ichi leaned in and softly rubbed his cheek against hers. The scent of face powder, hair oil, and the fragrance of a woman rose up, a cloying sweetness that made his heart ache.

"Mitsuko! Hey, my darling Mitsuko! You can’t be dead—I won't let them say it, even if you are—"

Shin’ichi pulled Mitsuko’s soft body into a crushing embrace, desperately kissing her lips, her eyelids, and her cheeks like a man possessed. Then, he paused. *What is that smell?* It was metallic, the scent of raw meat. He licked his lips and pulled back to look at her.

Blood. It was blood!

There was blood on Mitsuko’s snowy white cheeks and her forehead. He looked at his own palms.

"My God!"

He was covered in it. Dark red, viscous liquid clung to his palms, his cuffs, and even his limbs, half-dried and sticky.

"I have to run!"

It didn't matter where. If he was caught, it would be the end. He had to carry her and flee. Shin’ichi finally managed to hoist Mitsuko’s limp body onto his back—she felt as heavy and boneless as a worker’s load—and opened the door. Fortunately, the street was a dim, deserted night road.

*Where should I go? To the mountains, the river, the tracks... anywhere, as long as it's a place where we can die in peace.*

**V. Song of the Morning Breeze**

With desperate strength, Shin’ichi lowered Mitsuko from his back. 

"Mitsu! Mitsuko!" he screamed, shaking her by the shoulders.

The rice fields sparkled in the light, frogs croaked, and the surface of the lake shimmered under a quiet, bright moon.

"Ah! Shin’ichi-san!"

Mitsuko suddenly regained consciousness and opened her eyes wide. She looked around frantically, burst into violent sobs, and threw herself onto him. Shin’ichi held her as if he were mad. For a long time, the two of them simply wailed.

"It's too late... it can't be undone," Shin’ichi thought. The realization that he might never again be able to hold Mitsuko’s body, look into her sweet eyes, or touch her lips filled him with a sudden, sharp terror of death.

*No! I don’t want to die! I don’t want to die!*

"Mitsuko! I... what have I done? What should I do?" he cried out through his tears.

Mitsuko’s gaze went cold and fixed. Suddenly, she spoke with a fierce intensity.

"You fool! Shin’ichi, you absolute fool! My father... he knew everything about you. I told him. He’s a good man, a truly good man. He said there was no better news than two people being in love, and that he wouldn't be angry at all. He was even planning to go speak with your mother soon. And yet... and yet, you went and—oh, God!"

Mitsuko began to weep hysterically, her shoulders heaving. Shin’ichi stood frozen in horror. The blood drained from his face, and an uncontrollable shiver raced through his entire body.

"A-ah... so... that’s how it was..."

He clutched his head and rocked back and forth, sobbing in agony. In the distance, the ink-pale mountain range began to glow vividly in the cool, fresh air of dawn, indifferent to the tragedy of the two lovers.

A soft breeze began to play a night song across the lake and through the thickets.

"Wait! Someone... someone’s coming! Is it the police? Look, they’re running this way!"

Shin’ichi’s heart skipped a beat as he looked up.

"Hey! Shin’ichi—!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Layout and Structure
*   **Two-Part Content:** The page is split between the conclusion of a dramatic narrative (top/middle) and a humorous filler section (bottom).
*   **Vertical Orientation (Tategaki):** The text flows from top to bottom, right to left, which is standard for Japanese literature.
*   **Columnar Spacing:** The main story occupies the majority of the page. The bottom section, titled "笑話 名作縮刷版" (Jokes: Condensed Masterpiece Edition), is separated by a decorative border featuring a small illustration of a man’s head.
*   **Section Header:** The number "五. 朝風の唄" (5. Song of the Morning Breeze) indicates a chapter break or a new section within the story.

### Typography and Design
*   **Typeface:** A standard Ming-cho (Mincho) style font common in mid-century printing. The characters are densely packed.
*   **Emphasis Marks:** The text uses Japanese iteration marks (e.g., ／＼) to indicate repeated characters (like *yoro-yoro*).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the "Joke" section is enclosed in a stylized box to distinguish it from the heavy melodrama of the main text. Each joke starts with a diamond symbol (◆).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### The Era (1940s-1950s)
The language and tone are characteristic of the "Kasutori" culture or popular literary magazines of the immediate post-war period. These publications often mixed high-stakes melodrama (often involving crime or double suicide) with lighthearted humor.

### The "Shinju" (Love-Suicide) Trope
The scene plays on the classic Japanese literary trope of *Shinju*. Shin’ichi believes he has committed a crime (possibly killing someone or attempting a double suicide) only to find out through Mitsuko that the "obstacle" to their love (her father's disapproval) was non-existent. The tragedy arises from a fatal misunderstanding.

### Literary Puns in the Joke Section
The bottom section uses titles of famous literary works for comedic effect:
1.  **"Two Wives" (二人妻):** A play on domestic drama.
2.  **"Who Has No Dreams" (誰か夢なき):** Likely a reference to a popular song or film title of the era.
3.  **"Red and Black" (赤と黒):** Stendhal’s famous novel, here used to refer to "Red Tags" (sold items) and "Black" (tax/debt).
4.  **"A Dark Night's Passing" (暗夜行路):** Naoya Shiga's masterpiece, used here as a punchline for a man annoying his wife at night.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **血の気が退いた (Chi no ke ga hiita):** "Blood drained from the face." A common idiom for being pale or shocked.
*   **餅網工 (Mochiamiko):** Literally "mochi net worker." A somewhat archaic or specific simile for someone carrying a heavy, shifting, or limp load on their back.
*   **がむしゃら (Gamushara):** Reckless, frantic, or daredevil-like.
*   **しんねりと (Shinneri to):** Softly, quietly, or stealthily.
*   **愕然 (Gakuzen):** To be astonished, shocked, or struck with horror.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Fatal Misunderstanding:** The core of the drama is the irony that the protagonist’s desperation and "crime" were unnecessary. This reflects a common post-war theme of wasted effort and nihilistic tragedy.
*   **The Scent of Death vs. Life:** The sensory descriptions (scent of powder vs. scent of blood) highlight the transition from romance to horror.
*   **Indifferent Nature:** The description of the mountains and the morning breeze at the end serves as a "naturalistic" backdrop that remains beautiful and calm despite the human suffering occurring within it.
*   **Gender Roles:** Mitsuko is depicted as the "voice of reason" (though hysterical), while Shin’ichi is the impulsive, "mad" male lead driven to extremes by perceived social pressure.
