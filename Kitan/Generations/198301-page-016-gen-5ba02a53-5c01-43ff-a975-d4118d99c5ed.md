## Literal English Translation
It is the same as the Ewato dance, hoping that her age
will be long and the child quickly suckle/grow, and thoroughly
stopping the act of writing and giving it—is this truly kindness
or does it stop at compassion? Truly, is it an urgent/passionate
thing? The day the bride is tied
to the root [of the house], honoring the constantly
worn Ido [well-hand] sash, the Ido constantly
worn repeatedly tied, approaching bodies
to that of the sole partner just twice in this life.
Or, being loyal to the child of that parent,
if it is apparent, the heart is not between them, but
reading it as the foundation. Sometimes the truth is soaked,
I sleep, and the truth is not soaked,
I sleep at the sound of the wild bird crying,
neither night nor morning is there anything, she
sees the child. Guarding her in the midst of it,
seeing the husband as the parent, the father solely
is not revealed, not planning the act of bearing the name,
recklessly setting the bride, the name given is Natori River's name.

Now then,
These five characters of this introduction, "Hokai" (Preservation Precepts), are from a time past,
This woman's character was adopted by a certain person or family,
As if giving that woman over to someone else, this is a document
of instruction written intensely and given,
Truly, even the words have fragrance,
and may not pass into the ears of common townswomen or merchants,
but they should be considered the teachings
of a sage. Treating this as the truth, and accomplishing
the matter and giving it a name,
Immediately, the wife's soft parts are calmed
and dealt with softly, always without forgetting,
having communion with the path of the bridal chamber. Within the father's
enduring/beautiful Matsuyama Shigeru's middle grasses—
The grass does not grow into a thicket or a tree,
The grass's growing color is vividly bright, that sa...

## Literary English Translation
Like the dance of Ewato, wishing her long life
and for the child to thrive quickly, is he truly trying to stop
the practice of intensely writing and distributing this, or is this merely
pity and compassion? Is this indeed a vital and urgent
matter? The day the bride is bound, it is under the sun
that she worships the perpetually-worn Ido sash; thus, the Ido sash,
constantly worn and frequently tied, allows her to approach the body
of her sole partner only twice in this life.
Alternatively, [she is instructed] to be utterly faithful to the child of that parent.
If revealed, the heart is far away, yet this is read as
the fundamental principle. Sometimes the truth is saturated,
and I sleep; and when the truth is not saturated,
I sleep to the cry of the wild bird,
there is nothing, neither night nor morning; she
watches the child. Guarding her state within this,
she sees the husband as the parent, and the father's
singular role is not to be revealed. Not planning the act of taking
his name, [the father] carelessly chooses the bride, whose given name
is that of the Natori River.

Now then,
These five characters of this preface, the "Preservation Precepts" (*Hokai*), are from a time past.
This woman's character was adopted by a certain person or family.
It is a manuscript of moral instruction, written with great sincerity and given,
as if handing this woman over to another’s keeping.
In truth, even the words carry a subtle fragrance,
and they may not reach the ears of common townswomen or merchants,
but they ought to be esteemed as the teachings
of a sage. Treating this as truth, and concluding
the matter by giving it a name,
the wife’s soft private parts are immediately managed
and dealt with softly, always remembering
to have communion with the path of the bridal chamber. Within the father’s
magnificent, lush Pine Mountain—amidst the grasses—
The grass neither grows into a thicket nor a tree;
The growing color of the grass is vividly bright, that sa...

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
| Component | Observation | Implication / Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section Header** | `◆文献資料◆` (Documentary Source) | Frames the content as non-fiction, archival, or scholarly, a strategy to legitimize erotic content. |
| **Title Box** | `女（こ）名 小俣の忍學` (Kona Omata no Ningaku) | Identifies the source text as a pre-modern instructional manual concerning female sexuality and marital submission. |
| **Kana Usage** | Consistent use of Historical Kana Orthography (歴史的仮名遣い). | Reinforces the narrative that the core content is an antique or scholarly text. |
| **Editorial Voice** | Uses phrases like `過し頃みや` (from a time past) and evaluates the text against commoners (`市女商人の耳`). | Distant, intellectualizing voice, catering to a reader who views this material as cultural study rather than mere pornography. |
| **Core Text Voice** | Highly prescriptive, moralizing, and uses complex metaphors (Ido-obi, Natori River). | The voice of a patriarchal authority figure or moral instructor, setting severe constraints on the bride's sexuality. |
| **Structural Breakdown** | The text shifts between commentary (praising the document's sage-like nature) and direct quotation/paraphrase (detailing the bride's duties and sexual limits). | This structure mimics scholarly commentary on sensitive texts, providing both titillation and justification. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Ido-Obi (井手も常帯び):** A ritual sash worn constantly by the bride. The connection to *ido* (a well) symbolizes deep ties to the household, fertility, and purity—the water source being essential to life. The reference to it being "repeatedly tied" emphasizes perpetual marital fidelity and duty.
*   **The Restriction of Sex (二度と...身をあしよる):** The instruction that the bride approaches her partner's body "only twice" in her life is extremely strict, potentially referencing: 1) Initial initiation/consummation, implying all subsequent acts are for procreation only; 2) A misinterpretation of a specific regional rite; or 3) A deliberate hyperbolic moral restraint placed on women in certain feudal or deeply conservative marriage contracts. This heightens the sense of sexual deprivation and control.
*   **Omata (小俣):** This term (small crotch) serves as the core subject of the "Secret Teachings" (*Ningaku*). It is a blunt, yet clinical, reference to the female genitals, revealing that the "morality guide" is fundamentally a manual for managing the physical body.
*   **Hokai (保戒 - Preservation Precepts):** Suggests the document's primary purpose is the preservation of *female virtue* or marital order, which often meant preserving male lineage and ownership rights.
*   **Matsuyama Shigeru (松山茂):** A possible place name or a highly metaphorical reference. Pine trees (*matsu*) symbolize longevity and endurance (fitting *nin-gaku*), and the "lush mountain" metaphor may relate to the richness of the father's estate or the fertility of the daughter/bride herself.
*   **Mid-Showa Context:** The publication of this text (likely 1950s-1960s) reflects a postwar Japanese intellectual desire to explore and document pre-modern sexual taboos and customs, often using this 'archival' format to critique or sensationalize the patriarchy of the past.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
| Term (Original) | Literal Meaning | Semantic Nuance / Euphemism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **よはひながいく** | Age long going | Wishing for longevity (standard formal expression). |
| **身をあしよる** (身を相寄る) | To approach bodies together | Euphemism for coitus/sexual intimacy. |
| **保戒** (*Hokai*) | Preservation Precepts | Moral rules, implying sexual restraint and protection of chastity. |
| **女の字** (*onna no ji*) | Woman's character/figure | Refers to the adopted role or nature of the woman being instructed. |
| **市女商人** | Townswoman, merchant woman | Signifies the common class, positioned against the "sage" wisdom of the text. |
| **嫁の婦たわをざめ** | Govern/manage the wife's soft parts | **Central Euphemism:** Referring to the management (control, satisfaction, or discipline) of the wife's physical/sexual nature (tawa = softness, or female body). |
| **はこやの道** (箱屋の道) | Path of the bridal chamber/box house | Euphemism for the act of marriage and specifically, the marital sexual duty. |
| **小俣** (*Omata*) | Small crotch | **Explicit Euphemism/Slang:** Female genitalia; the subject of the entire treatise. |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis
*   **The Objectification of the Bride:** The bride is consistently treated as property or a vehicle for the male line. She is "given over" (`人のがりやる`), her body is managed (`たわを治め`), and her identity (her name) is arbitrary (`みだりに嫁をさだめて`).
*   **Ero-Guro Sadism/Control Fantasy:** The extreme restrictions placed on the bride (sex only twice, constant adherence to rituals) satisfy a voyeuristic fantasy centered on observing institutionalized sexual deprivation and disciplined submission under a strict patriarchal system.
*   **The Fragrant Text:** The description of the instructional text as having "fragrance" (`言葉すらかおりにして`) serves to fetishize the document itself, elevating the secrets contained within to an almost spiritual or sensory level, heightening the appeal to the educated reader.
*   **Sexual Initiation and Duty:** The text heavily implies that the *Nin Gaku* is a form of instruction manual specifically aimed at conditioning the bride for her sexual duties and ensuring she prioritizes male lineage and patriarchal norms.
*   **The Unexpressed Father:** The instruction that "the father's singular role is not to be revealed" may refer to the necessity of concealing the mechanisms of patriarchal power or the true nature of the sexual exchange from the child or the public eye.
