## 1️⃣ Luggage Rack's Find

Beside a beautiful woman's strong perfume's
smell, and warm skin's elasticity, physically
feeling, Wakagi Toshirō, as if
drugged, in Kobe
was continuing a nap.
It was inside a temporary express train of Hair [?]. In Kobe
when he noticed, he suddenly was in the next compartment.
When he tried to take the Boston bag from the luggage rack (Amida-na),
a black leather, sparkling handbag
was lying underneath it.
"Oh," while thinking, Wakagi surveyed inside the carriage.
When putting it on the rack (Amido), that
must have resulted in bad luck [?] (suki ni natte).
It was.
Especially around Wakagi, nobody
was visible. If the owner-like female passenger
was also not visible, it certainly must be a forgotten
item. Anyway, having the hand
bag, Wakagi got off, and that forgetful passenger
who was,
while waiting for the anger
to quiet down, he, at the ticket gate,
pretending to be busy [?], so that nobody
would see him, dropped it into his
pocket. He took the hand
bag and slowly returned
to his apartment,
alone. When he opened the black leather handbag
and looked, there was a red checked handkerchief
and then a business card.
Five identical business cards were there, a hundred yen note, a Tanimura
Yuki business card was what he saw, Wakagi, every time he looked, from the bottom a fine
inspection
notebook was extracted with long
pen hasty writing.

had matched.
If a person who has picked up this handbag
is present, please deliver it to Tanimura Yuki,
152, [X] Town, Ashiya City. We would like to offer
a substantial reward of money.

The next day, late afternoon. Wakagi went out to look for the owner, Tanimura
Yuki, the voice's owner of the hand
bag. From Ashiya Station (Eki), walking
a good distance, he entered a certain street corner tobacco shop,
bought one bead, and inquired about Tanimura's
house. The tobacco shop's old woman,
"Ah, is it Tanimura-san? It's over there,
you know." She pointed and told him the direction he should follow.
A Western-style mansion with a blue roof, in the middle of the planting,
was faintly visible.
When he pressed the doorbell at the entrance,
soon the door opened, and Tanimura Yuki and
her five-year-old daughter came out.
"Say. Is the Madam home?"
"Yes, the Madam is home. She is currently
taking a rest, but do you have
some urgent business?"
"I just wanted to meet the Madam briefly and
hand over a forgotten item."
The maid said, "I will inform her," and
went out for a while.
The maid went away to the back. After a while,
she came out and said, "It is an explicit matter."
Wakagi was made to lower his head desperately
and pass through. Deep c...

"This, Madam's praise does not exist
for this."
"Yes,
is."

(Interspersed context, meeting the Madam):
Also, the maid brought
coffee.
"Please wait a moment."
Up to the fragrant coffee he hadn't drunk in years.
The room was pure Western style, luxurious
furnishings like a table, long sofa,
bookshelf, embroidered wall hanging (shishū no kake), curtain,
and electric stand were neatly arranged.
The wide open window reflected the bright courageous figure's
light. The smell of the morning sun from outside the window
blew in, feeling refreshing.
thing, I'll return it to its original state, so speak.
The maid did not reply, Tanimura Yuki stood in the center
near the corner of the door,
the emerald earring's scale [?],
had a sleek face like black obsidian. She inclined her head, perhaps
asking if she should bow her head.
"Oh, how forward you are."
Then again, the maid intentionally smiled,
and her beautiful, tumultuous black Poloide
hair. The Poloide had been patented, given by the husband of a famous 'Kinomi' woman
as natural Poloide.
Since it was only a short time, she took out a light handbag.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

## 1️⃣ The Find on the Rack

Wakagi Toshirō, physically sensing the powerful perfume and the warm, springy flesh of the beautiful woman beside him, felt as if he had been administered a narcotic and continued his doze in Kobe.
He was on a provisional express train. When he came to in Kobe, he found himself suddenly in the next compartment.
He reached up to retrieve a Boston bag from the luggage rack, only to find a shiny black leather handbag lying underneath it.
"Oh?" he thought, scanning the carriage. Since it had been placed on the rack, this was turning into quite a curious incident.
It was certain.
Nobody immediately surrounding Wakagi seemed to notice it. If the likely female owner wasn't among the passengers, it must surely be a forgotten item. In any case, Wakagi got off the train holding the handbag.
While waiting for his initial flare of confusion (and perhaps anger) to subside, he pretended to adjust himself at the ticket gate and, ensuring no one saw him, slipped the bag into his pocket. He carried the handbag and slowly returned to his solitary apartment.
Opening the black leather handbag, he found a red checked handkerchief and a business card.
There were five identical business cards, a hundred-yen note, and the card bore the name Tanimura Yuki. Each time Wakagi looked, he noticed a fine inspection record, consisting of long lines of hasty penmanship, extracted from the very bottom of the bag.

## 2️⃣ The Widow's Feast

[The note read]:
If anyone has picked up this handbag, please deliver it to Tanimura Yuki, 152 [X] Town, Ashiya City. We wish to offer a substantial monetary reward.

The next day, late in the afternoon, Wakagi set out to find Tanimura Yuki, the owner whose voice he had heard (in his memory/imagination of the note's plea). He walked a considerable distance from Ashiya Station. He stopped at a corner tobacco shop, bought a bead (of chewing gum/candy), and asked for directions to Ms. Tanimura's house. The tobacco shop owner replied:
"Ah, Tanimura-san? She’s over there." She pointed out the direction, and Wakagi followed the path until a blue-roofed Western-style mansion became faintly visible through the shrubbery.
He pressed the doorbell at the entrance.
Presently, the door opened, and Tanimura Yuki and her five-year-old daughter appeared.
"Excuse me. Is the Madam at home?"
"Yes, the Madam is in. She is currently resting, but do you have some urgent business?"
"I only wish to see the Madam briefly to return a forgotten item."
The maid replied, "I will inform her," and withdrew for a moment.
The maid returned after a brief delay.
"It is an explicit matter, then."
Wakagi, desperately bowing his head, was made to pass inside. Deep c...
(Meanwhile, describing the Madam's room and maid):
The maid returned with coffee.
"Please wait a moment."
He drank the fragrant coffee, the kind he hadn't enjoyed for years.
The room was purely Western-style. Luxurious furnishings—a table, long sofa, bookshelf, embroidered wall hanging, curtains, and an electric stand—were perfectly arranged. The widely opened window reflected the light of a bright, bracing figure. The smell of the morning sun wafted in, refreshing the air.
[The maid asks]: "Speak, and I will return the item to its original state."
The maid remained silent, standing near the corner of the centrally placed door.
Her face, slick like black obsidian, shone with the luster of emerald earrings. She bowed her head slightly. Perhaps she was asking if she should bow.
"Oh, how forward of me," she murmured.
Then, the maid intentionally smiled, revealing her beautiful, voluminous black hair, styled in a "Poloide"—a product patented and gifted by the husband of a woman famous for her 'Kinomi' [a type of hair accessory or style]—that mimicked natural hair.
As the meeting was brief, she quickly produced a light handbag.
Madam:
"I assure you, no praise from the Madam is necessary for this."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is presented in the traditional Japanese vertical writing format (**tate-gaki**), read from right to left, top to bottom.

**Structure and Layout:**
1.  **Illustration and Title:** A large, dramatic illustration dominates the upper-middle section, depicting a stylized, sensuous woman (the "Bewitching Sorceress"). The main title, **「まどかの蟲惑の妖女」** (Madoka no Kōwaku no Yōjo), is written in thick, highly stylized script overlaying the image. The name **「谷村美子」** (Tanimura Yoshiko/Biko) is written vertically beside the figure, likely the illustrator's or author's name, or possibly the depicted character's name (conflicting with the story's "谷村ユキ").
2.  **Section Headings:** The text is clearly divided into two numbered sections, characteristic of a serial novel or short story:
    *   **一、細タナの拾いもの** (Luggage Rack's Find)
    *   **二、未亡人の饗宴** (The Widow's Feast)
3.  **Column Density:** The text is tightly packed, typical of publications trying to maximize content space (e.g., popular magazines or *kashihon* pulp novels).
4.  **Flow Confusion:** The flow is significantly disrupted around the illustration, leading to fragmented sentences, repeated phrases, and illogical line breaks, suggesting complex paste-up or printing issues in the original source material. For instance, sections describing the handbag contents and the maid's dialogue overlap and are repeated in the transcription area.
5.  **Typography:** Characters are standard mincho style, suitable for mass print media of the mid-20th century. Emphasis is primarily handled via line breaks and the large, stylized title. There are some instances of obsolete kana (e.g., ゐ, ゑ, やう, いふ, だつた) characteristic of the pre-1946 orthographic reforms, or a transitional period (1940s-1950s).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Era and Setting:**
The story is set in the **post-war period** (likely 1950s) in the Kansai region of Japan. The mention of **Kobe (神戸)** and **Ashiya City (芦屋市)** is significant. Ashiya is historically known as one of Japan's most affluent suburban areas, suggesting the setting involves upper-class wealth and Westernized living.

**Social Context:**
*   **Westernization:** The description of the Tanimura house as a **"purely Western-style room" (純洋室)** and a **"Western-style mansion with a blue roof" (青い屋根の洋館)** highlights the aspiration and reality of modernization among the wealthy elite in post-war Japan. Items like tables, long sofas, curtains, and coffee reinforce this Westernized lifestyle.
*   **The Widow (未亡人):** The title "The Widow's Feast" suggests a narrative focusing on a woman of independent means, perhaps newly wealthy or handling an inherited estate—a common figure in mid-century fiction exploring changing gender roles and wealth distribution.
*   **Terminology:** The use of **「ハンドバツク」** and **「ボストン」** (Handbag and Boston bag) indicates English loanwords commonly adopted during the period. The reference to **「ポロイド」** (Poloide) hair is likely a reference to a popular synthetic hair or hair treatment/wig of the time, often associated with a fashionable, modern look, contrasting with traditional styles.

**Orthography:**
The presence of obsolete historical kana usage (歴史的仮名遣い - *rekishiteki kanazukai*), such as *ゐ* (wi), *ゑ* (we), *やう* (yō), and *だつた* (datta), strongly suggests the publication predates the full standardization of modern orthography (Shinjitai and Gendaikanazukai) in 1946/1947, or was published in a conservative literary journal or pulp format that retained older standards well into the 1950s.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

| Japanese Term (Original/Normalized) | Classification | Meaning/Usage/Modern Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **蟲惑** (Kōwaku) | Archaic/Literary Kanji | Bewitchment, fascination, ensnarement. Highly evocative, used to describe seduction or irresistible allure. |
| **妖女** (Yōjo) | Literary Noun | Sorceress, enchantress, bewitching woman. Aligns with the sensual tone set in the opening. |
| **細タナ / 網ダナ** (Amida-na) | Vernacular/Archaic Noun | Luggage rack (in a train carriage). The kanji is typically 網棚. The use of kana or archaic forms indicates period language. |
| **仮急電車** (Kakyū Densha) | Period Specific | Provisional Express Train. Implies a less common or specific type of short-term transportation route. |
| **昼寝り** (Hiruneri) | Archaic Noun | Nap, siesta. Modernly 昼寝 (hirune). |
| **さしすめ** (Sashisume) | Archaic Adverb | Certainly, definitely, indeed. Used to strongly affirm a conclusion. |
| **はかまけて** (Hakamakete) | Archaic Verb Form | Likely a corruption or archaic form meaning 'taking advantage of the confusion,' or 'pretending to be busy/occupied' (often associated with 構けて/kama(ke)te). |
| **シシュウの壁カケ** (Shishū no Kabekake) | Loanword/Noun | Embroidered wall hanging. (シシュウ = 刺繍, embroidery). |
| **ポロイド** (Poloide) | Specific Noun/Brand | A product or style, likely related to hair treatment or wigs, famous for mimicking natural hair structure in the post-war era. |
| **おませ** (Omase) | Noun/Adjective | Precocious, acting older than one's age. Used here possibly in a polite, slightly critical sense: "How forward (of me/you)." |
| **懸命** (Kenmei) | Noun/Adjective | Eagerness, desperately, using all one's might. Used to describe Wakagi's posture (desperately bowing his head). |
| **おほめ** (O-home) | Archaic Keigo | Praise, compliment (honorific). Modernly お褒め. |

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**Thematic Focus:** The story primarily deals with **Intrusion and Social Class Crossing**, framed by themes of **Sensuality** and **Mystery**.

**1. Sensuality and the Allure of the Unknown (The Sorceress):**
The opening section establishes a highly sensual atmosphere. Wakagi is overcome, not by sleep, but by the "strong perfume" and "warm elasticity" of the woman beside him, suggesting an erotic undertone that justifies the title, *Bewitching Sorceress*. The found handbag becomes a fetish object, a physical link to this intoxicating, high-status woman. The protagonist is not merely returning lost property; he is pursuing a mysterious, seductive figure.

**2. Class and Power Dynamics:**
The encounter immediately contrasts the protagonist (Wakagi, living in an *apartment*) with the owner (Tanimura Yuki, residing in a luxurious, Western-style mansion in affluent Ashiya). When Wakagi arrives, he is forced into a subordinate position, having to *desperately bow his head* (懸命に頭を下げ) just to be admitted. The dialogue reinforces this power structure: Tanimura’s maid treats Wakagi with formal caution ("It is an explicit matter," or "Do you have urgent business?"). Tanimura’s final line, implying no reward is needed or that his efforts require no high praise, subtly reinforces her social superiority and independence.

**3. The MacGuffin and the Narrative Catalyst:**
The handbag and its contents (business cards, 100 yen, the inspection note) serve as a MacGuffin. They are not intrinsically valuable enough to warrant the dramatic pursuit, but they act as a pretext for Wakagi to cross the boundaries of class and access the exclusive world of the widow. The "inspection note" (点検のてをあり) found deep within the bag hints at hidden secrets or a meticulous nature, deepening the intrigue surrounding the owner.
