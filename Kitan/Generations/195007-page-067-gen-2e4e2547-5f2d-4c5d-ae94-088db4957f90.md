**闇夜（やみよ）の辻斬（つじぎり）**
**浅香 耕策**

本郷はお茶の水の濠端。日はもうトップリと暮れてしまつて、折柄の闇夜に、あたりは物凄いほどシンとして、天狗に鼻をつままれさうな夜であつた。
この時、橋の袂にこんもり茂つた柳の蔭から、ヌッと姿を現した一人の男がある。闇をすかして、よく見ると、黒装束に身を固め、袴の股立ちをキリと取つた大兵肥満の有村治左衛門である。有村は、薩摩の藩中に勇名かくれも無き猛者。その有村が、何のための忍び姿であらう、
「今夜に限つて、人つ子一人通らぬとは、どうしたわけか」
と、獨り言、すると、物悲しげな按摩の笛が、ピーピーと闇を縫つて聴えて来た。
「来るぞ、〜、ハ、ア此方へ来るな、待てば甘露の雨が降るとはよく言うたものだ。が待てよ。いくら相手が按摩でも、こう自分の姿をむき出しては悪かろう。どれ暫くの辛棒じや」
呟きながら、柳のかげへそつとかくれた。此方は按摩、もとより此んな事があろうとは夢にも知らない、元町の方から濠端づたいにお茶の水橋にさしかかつた。
すると、柳のかげにかくれていた有村は按摩を一間ばかり先へ、やりすごしておいてその背後から忍び足、有村の右手は大刀の柄を握つている。いうまでもなく、この按摩を試し斬りにするつもり。
「オ、寒むッ。あゝ今夜も又、くたびれ損かなァ、宵から流して歩いているのに、まだ一度も呼ばれない。何んさいい情ないことだろう。家には子供が、空いた腹をかかえて待つているように。あゝ浮世がしみる〜いやになつた。ピーピー」
按摩の泣言、有村もそぞろに憐れを催して
「可愛相じや、こんな按摩を斬らんでも、まだ他に斬るべき者があるう。まゝよ助けてやれ」
有村が身を引くと、按摩の笛は次第次第に遠くなつて、闇の彼方へ消えて行く。
「折角出逢つたと思えば、不憫な按摩、こりや、どうも今夜は間が悪いぞ。もう夜も大分更けてしまつた。これではとても、見込がない。残念ながら又明晩……おッ誰か来た」
と、柳のかげに身をかくし、息を殺して待ち受け、見ると、湯島の方から、小田原提灯がブラリ〜、
「ハ、ア、いよ〜来たな。今度こそ逃がすまいぞ」
かとは知らず、小田原提灯あつちへブラリ、こつちへブラリ。

**不倫行爲から白子（しろこ）三人まで生んだ実話**

私の生れ故郷四国の片田舎に、通稱鶴さんという鍛冶屋さんがありました。此の人の両親も私は幼少の頃よく知つた仲でしたが、何一つ常の人と異つた事のない人達で、二人共、余程高齢迄生きていました。
此の夫婦の中に四人の子供がありました。一番の總領が女で、至極健康な、どつちかというと人並以上の美貌の娘で、二十才頃に隣村へ縁付きました。
次は長男の鶴さん。その次は次女のお徳さんという娘。末子も女で、二人共少しも常人と異らぬ娘で、体格も大きく、学校の成績もよく出来たようでしたが、末子の方は十才の頃、病気に罹つて若死にしました。
鶴さんの家系は大体右に書いた通りですが、さて、此の家族の中で問題の中心となる者は長男の鶴さんと、其の次の娘、つまり鶴さんの直ぐ次のお徳さんの此の二人なんです。
鶴さんは若い時、鍛冶の火花が眼に飛び込んで眼球を傷け、そのため失明して一方の眼球が醜く隆起していました。が、其の外には何一つ常人と異つたことはなく、毛髪も真黒で、顔色もどちらかというと黒い方でした。頭は上等とは言えませんでしたが、勿論白痴とか言うのではなく、鍛冶の職業も熱心に励んでいました。
次の妹のお徳さんも、何一つ当り前の人と異つた事はなく、ちよつと目立つ位の美人でした。何でも十八才頃には町内の若い衆との間に浮いた話もあつたようでした。
さて、何んという神様の物好きでしょう。此の兄と妹が人眼を避けて不倫の行爲を繰り返す仲となりました。その発覚の端緒は、隣家の者の眼に、兄が妹を無闇に可愛がり、ちよつとでも妹が外出すると、兄が馬鹿に気にして捜し歩くといった事に注意したのが初めでしたが、追々に兄妹とも面の皮が厚くなつて人眼にも余るようになつて参りました。
程なく妹は妊娠しました。申し忘れましたが、その時、兄は三十才、妹は二十四才だつたと覚えています、月満ちて産み落した子はどうでしょう。世にも珍しい白子（しろこ）でした。

**Midnight Street Killing**
**by Asaka Kosaku**

Hongo is the moat side of Ochanomizu. The sun has already completely set, and in the opportune dark night, the surroundings were ghastly silent, a night so dark that one's nose might be pinched by a Tengu. At this time, from the shadow of a thick willow growing by the bridge's foot, one man suddenly appeared. Peering through the darkness, looking closely, he is Arimura Jizaemon, a large and stout man clad in black garments, with his hakama's skirts tucked up sharply. Arimura is a warrior whose fame is hidden from none within the Satsuma domain. For what purpose would Arimura be in this stealthy guise?
"To think that on this night of all nights, not a single soul passes—why is that?"
He spoke to himself. Then, the melancholy flute of a blind masseur came sewing through the darkness, *pee-pee*.
"Here he comes... Ah, don't come this way. They say 'if you wait, sweet dew rain will fall.' But wait. No matter if the opponent is a masseur, showing my figure like this would be bad. Well, I must endure for a bit."
Muttering, he hid softly in the willow's shadow. This side, the masseur, naturally having no dream that such a thing might be, approached Ochanomizu Bridge along the moat from the direction of Motomachi.
Then, Arimura, who was hidden in the willow's shadow, let the masseur pass by about one *ken* (approx. 2 meters) and followed behind him with stealthy steps. Arimura's right hand is gripping the hilt of his great sword. Needless to say, he intends to use this masseur for a "test killing" (*tsujigiri*).
"Oh, cold. Ah, tonight again, maybe a waste of effort. Though I've been walking and playing since early evening, I haven't been called once. What a miserable thing it is. At home, the children are waiting, holding their empty bellies. Ah, the floating world pierces me... I've grown sick of it. *Pee-pee*."
Hearing the masseur's laments, even Arimura was moved by a sudden pity.
"Pitiable. I need not kill such a masseur; there must be others more worthy of being cut down. So be it, let him go."
As Arimura pulled back, the masseur's flute gradually grew distant and vanished into the far side of the darkness.
"Just as I thought we finally met, a pitiful masseur. Truly, tonight the timing is bad. The night has already grown quite late. With this, there's no prospect. Regrettably, again tomorrow night... Oh, someone has come."
Hiding in the willow's shadow, holding his breath and waiting, he saw an Odawara lantern swaying from the direction of Yushima.
"Ha, at last he has come. This time I shall not let him escape."
Not knowing this, the Odawara lantern swayed there and swayed here.
"How strange, the lantern shakes violently. At this late hour... who on earth could it be?"
Thinking it mysterious and spying, the man was nearly fifty years old, a samurai of refined appearance. However, he was quite intoxicated...

**The Sorrow of Consanguineous Marriage**
**A true story of giving birth up to three albinos from an illicit act**

In my birthplace, a rural area of Shikoku, there was a blacksmith called "Tsuru-san." I knew his parents well since childhood; they were people in no way different from ordinary folk, and both lived to a very old age.
Among this couple, there were four children. The eldest was a daughter, extremely healthy, and if anything, a girl of more than average beauty, who married into the neighboring village around age twenty.
Next was the eldest son, Tsuru-san. After him was the second daughter, a girl called O-toku. The youngest was also a girl; both were girls in no way different from ordinary people, large in stature, and seemed to do well in school, but the youngest fell ill and died young at age ten.
Tsuru-san's lineage is roughly as written above, but now, the ones who become the center of the problem in this family are the eldest son Tsuru-san and the next daughter, namely O-toku who is immediately after Tsuru-san.
When Tsuru-san was young, a spark from the forge flew into his eye and damaged the eyeball; because of that, he lost sight and one eyeball was hideously protruded. But other than that, he was in no way different from ordinary people, his hair was pitch black, and his complexion was, if anything, on the darker side. His intellect could not be called superior, but of course, he was not what one would call an idiot; he worked diligently at his blacksmithing profession.
The next sister, O-toku, was also in no way different from a normal person and was a beauty who stood out a bit. It seemed there were even rumors of romance between her and the young men of the town around age eighteen.
Now, what a whim of the gods. This brother and sister, avoiding the eyes of others, became involved in a relationship where they repeated acts of adultery. The beginning of the discovery was when a neighbor noticed that the brother excessively doted on the sister, and if she went out even slightly, the brother would worry foolishly and walk around looking for her. Eventually, both brother and sister became thick-skinned and it became intolerable to public eyes.
Before long, the sister became pregnant. I forgot to mention, but at that time, I remember the brother was thirty and the sister was twenty-four. When the months were full and she gave birth, how was the child? It was a "shirako" (albino), rare in the world.
"Shirako" is, in Western language...

**Ambush in the Dead of Night**
**By Asaka Kosaku**

The setting is the embankment along the Ochanomizu moat in Hongo. The sun had long since sunk, and in the pitch-black night, the surroundings were so unnervingly silent that one felt as though a mountain goblin might snatch them away at any moment. 
Suddenly, a man emerged from the dense willow thicket at the foot of the bridge. Peering through the gloom, one could see he was a massive, burly figure named Arimura Jizaemon, dressed in black and ready for action with his *hakama* skirts tucked high. Arimura was a renowned warrior of the Satsuma clan. What business could such a man have lurking in the shadows?
"What is this? On this particular night, not a soul passes by," he muttered to himself.
Just then, the mournful notes of a blind masseur’s flute—*pee-pee*—drifted through the dark.
"He’s coming... Ah, wait, not him. They say patience brings its own reward, but I must stay hidden. It wouldn't do to expose myself even to a blind man. I’ll just have to bear it a while longer."
Whispering this, Arimura melted back into the shadows of the willow. The masseur, blissfully unaware of the danger, approached the bridge along the moat. Arimura let the man pass by a few feet, then began to tail him with silent steps, his hand tightening on the hilt of his long sword. He intended to use the poor man to test his blade.
"Brrr, it’s cold," the masseur sighed. "Another wasted night. I’ve been walking since dusk and haven't had a single customer. How miserable life is. My children are at home right now, clutching their hungry bellies. This world is a bitter place... I’m weary of it. *Pee-pee*."
Hearing the masseur’s lament, even the hardened Arimura felt a pang of pity.
"Poor devil. There’s no need to cut down a man like him when there are surely better targets. Go on, then—live."
As Arimura retreated, the sound of the flute faded into the distance.
"What rotten luck. I finally find someone, and it’s a man to be pitied. It’s getting late; I doubt I’ll find another tonight. A shame, but there’s always tomorrow... Wait! Someone's coming."
He hid once more. An Odawara lantern came bobbing along from the direction of Yushima.
"Aha! Here at last. This one won't escape me."
Unaware, the lantern swayed toward him.
"How strange. That lantern is shaking violently. Who on earth is out this late?"
Curious, Arimura peered closer. It was a samurai of nearly fifty years, a man of noble bearing, though he appeared to be quite drunk...

**The Tragedy of Forbidden Blood**
**A True Account: From Incest to the Birth of Three Albinos**

In my rural hometown in Shikoku, there lived a blacksmith known as "Tsuru-san." I knew his parents well; they were perfectly ordinary people who lived to a ripe old age. 
They had four children. The eldest daughter was a healthy, striking beauty who married into a neighboring village. Tsuru-san was the eldest son, followed by a sister named O-toku, and a youngest daughter who sadly died of illness at age ten. 
The focus of this tragic tale is Tsuru-san and his younger sister, O-toku. In his youth, a spark from the forge had struck Tsuru-san’s eye, leaving him blind and with a disfigured, protruding eyeball. Aside from that, he appeared normal—pitch-black hair and a dark complexion. While not particularly bright, he was a hard worker. O-toku was a notable beauty, and by eighteen, she was already the subject of local gossip among the young men of the town.
However, in a cruel twist of fate, the brother and sister began a secret, illicit affair. It started when neighbors noticed Tsuru-san’s obsessive doting; he would pace the streets in a panic if his sister was away for even a moment. Eventually, the two became emboldened, and their behavior became a public scandal.
Soon, O-toku became pregnant. At the time, Tsuru-san was thirty and O-toku was twenty-four. When the child was finally born, it was a "shirako"—an albino. In Western terms, this is called...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The page is split horizontally into two distinct editorial zones. The top half is fiction, while the bottom half is presented as a sensational "true story." This "split-interest" layout was common in Japanese pulp magazines of the 1950s.
*   **Typography:** 
    *   The top title "闇夜の辻斬" uses a classic, slightly serifed vertical font typical of period fiction.
    *   The bottom title "血族結婚の悲哀" is rendered in a heavy, hand-drawn, "creepy" decorative font to emphasize the shocking nature of the content.
    *   Furigana (phonetic readings) is used for difficult or period-specific words like "辻斬" (Tsujigiri) and "白子" (Shirako).
*   **Illustration:** The bottom article features a striking, emotional illustration of a crying baby, emphasizing the "tragedy" and "innocent victim" themes of the story.
*   **Pagination:** The page is numbered "-68-" at the bottom right.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The use of large, bold titles for both sections creates an immediate draw for the reader, using sensationalism (samurai violence at the top, incest/genetic "deformity" at the bottom) to capture attention.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Era (1950s):** This text likely comes from a *kasutori* (dreg) magazine or a general pulp monthly from the mid-1950s. Post-war Japan saw a massive boom in these low-cost publications that focused on sex, crime, and "bizarre" human interest stories.
*   **Tsujigiri (辻斬):** A historical practice where a samurai would test a new sword or his own skill by attacking a random passerby at night. By the Edo period, it was a capital crime, often associated with villainy or madness in literature.
*   **Anma (按摩):** Blind masseurs were a common sight in Japanese towns until the mid-20th century. They would walk the streets at night playing a distinctive whistle (*pee-pee*) to advertise their services.
*   **Albinism (白子 - Shirako):** In the 1950s, genetic conditions like albinism were often misunderstood and viewed with superstition. In pulp media, they were frequently linked to "sins" such as incest (consanguineous marriage), serving as a moral warning disguised as medical "truth."
*   **Arimura Jizaemon:** A real historical figure (a Satsuma samurai who participated in the assassination of Ii Naosuke in 1860). Here, he is used as a stock character in a fictional setting.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **濠端 (Horibata):** The edge or bank of a moat.
*   **股立ち (Momodachi):** Tucking up the long skirts of a *hakama* into the belt to allow for better leg movement during combat or travel.
*   **甘露の雨 (Kanro no ame):** Literally "sweet dew rain," a Buddhist-derived metaphor for a welcome blessing or a "godsend" after a long wait.
*   **不憫 (Fubin):** Pitiful or pathetic.
*   **小田原提灯 (Odawara Chochin):** A collapsible, cylindrical paper lantern used by travelers.
*   **白子 (Shirako):** An archaic/pejorative term for an albino person. In modern Japanese, "albinism" is preferred (アルビニズム).
*   **総領 (Soryo):** The eldest child or heir of a family.
*   **面の皮が厚い (Tsuranokawa ga atsui):** Literally "thick-skinned face"; meaning to be shameless or brazen.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Moral Contrast:** The first story shows a "noble" samurai who overcomes his violent urge through pity, while the second story depicts a "fall from grace" where siblings succumb to "unnatural" urges.
*   **Sensationalism & Voyeurism:** Both stories rely on the reader's fascination with the dark side of human nature—random violence on one hand, and sexual taboos/genetic anomalies on the other.
*   **The "True Story" Trope:** The bottom article uses the framing of "I knew this family" to lend credibility to a sensationalist tale of incest. This was a standard rhetorical strategy in postwar pulp to justify exploring taboo subjects.
*   **Class & Disability:** There is a recurring theme of the "pitiful" disabled person (the blind masseur, the blind blacksmith). In the fiction, it leads to mercy; in the "true story," the disability is linked to a wider family "tragedy" and moral failing.
