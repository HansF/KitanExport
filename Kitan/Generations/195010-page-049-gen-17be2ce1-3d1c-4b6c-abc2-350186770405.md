ることが日課のようであった。
「こうしているうちに、おいおい仕事の方がわかって来るんだから……、あなたは何が一番お好きでしたね」
いつもそんな事を尋ねて、微笑している主人であった。彼女はその堂々たる態度、その親切そうな様子。それよりも遊び半分らしいその仕事が何よりも嬉しかった。
そして主人の秘書として、やがては多くの使用人の中に尊敬される自分を描いてみたりした。そうした日が一週間も続いた。この間に孝子が不思議に思ったのは、前からいた三、四人の美しい少女が順に姿を消して、一週間の後には一人も残っていないという事実であった。
女専出というタイピストは四日ばかりで見えなくなった。彼女を最初取り次いだ少女もいつの間にか邸から姿を消しているらしかった。
一週間過ぎた夜。彼女は自分に宛てられた室で一人読書に耽っていた。するとドアをノックする音がする。この夜更けに何事かと耳を澄ますと、「岩佐さん」と呼んでいるのは、確かに主人の声であった。
「お休みですか」
「はい、ただいま、開けます」
孝子はドアを開けて主人を室へ導き入れた。主人は前に幾度もその室へ訪れているので、彼女は別に不思議とも思わなかった。
「どんな御用でございます」
「いや、大したこともないのですが、少しお話したいと思ってね」
それから主人は話を進めて、ついに初心な彼女が顔を真紅にするような淫らな話題を持ち出してきた。そして突然に彼女の手を捉えて引き寄せようとした。彼女は夢中で争った。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

[Upper Section]
...was like a daily routine. 
"While doing [it] like this, gradually the work part [you] will come to understand... what did you like most?" 
Always asking such things, [he] was a smiling master. She [liked] that dignified attitude, that kind-looking appearance. More than that, the work that seemed like half-play was more than anything happy [to her].
And as the master's secretary, eventually among many servants [she] imagined herself being respected. Those days continued for a week. During this time, what Takako thought was strange was the fact that the three or four beautiful girls who were there before disappeared in order, and after a week, not one remained.
The typist, a women's college graduate, became invisible after about four days. The girl who first announced her arrival also seemed to have disappeared from the mansion before she knew it.
A night after one week passed. She was indulging in reading alone in the room assigned to her. Then there is a sound of knocking on the door. Listening closely to what it could be late at night, the one calling "Iwasa-san" was certainly the master's voice.
"Are you sleeping?"
"Yes, right now, I will open [it]."
Takako opened the door and guided the master into the room. Because the master had visited that room many times before, she did not think it particularly strange.
"What kind of business is it?"
"No, it is nothing major, but I thought I wanted to talk a little."
From there the master advanced the talk, and finally brought up such lewd topics that the innocent girl made her face crimson. And suddenly grabbing her hand he tried to pull her close. She fought frantically.
With her hair disheveled, she escaped from this mansion while barefoot; it was a terribly late, cold winter night.

[Middle Section]
**1. The Downfall of a Woman who Dreamed of Stardom**
Having graduated from the city's girls' school and being in her rural home, for Hyakue, longing for the glamorous capital was burning like fire.
Thinking that rotting away in the countryside like this was without purpose in life, agonizing days continued. Because she thought of marrying ordinarily as a lifetime ruin, she did not try to respond to any marriage proposals.
Hyakue, on that day too, while thinking idly, unintentionally took the newspaper in hand and opened it without really reading. Suddenly, characters that strongly attracted her: --New Movie Actress Recruitment-- High school graduate, persons with enthusiasm to become a future star, those from rural areas welcome -- Send resume and recent photo urgently, response regarding hiring success or failure will be sent --
She read those characters over and over. And by herself she decided to think of herself as a star candidate. ...Girls' school [I] graduated with excellence. Body is strong, music and literature too, if it's me... besides this appearance, this style, a movie star... definitely [I] can become one.
Thinking so, Hyakue felt as if she had already become a star. Facing the desk, taking a pen, she tried writing "Miyagi Hyakue." That already seemed like it was a star's name.
She immediately sent a long letter stating her aspiration along with a resume and photo. After that, she was restless enough to be suspected by her family.
The reply from XX Production made Hyakue ecstatic. Meaning such as "wanting to hire you as an ideal star candidate" was written in beautiful characters that made a young woman's heart dance. And even a guide map from Ueno Station to the place called XX Production was enclosed.
If she consults her parents, it's obvious they would object without a second thought. Finally deciding to run away from home, she prepared kimono, withdrew savings, and prepared in secret.
Saying she was visiting a neighborhood friend, she left home and got on a train for Ueno. As expected, leaving her hometown she was lonely. However, that was erased by the glamorous dream of a star.
From Ueno Station, she took a bicycle taxi and hurried immediately to XX Production. She finally [arrived] at a certain cramped back alley...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

[Upper Section: Takako's Escape]
It had become part of her daily routine. "You'll get the hang of the work as we go along," her employer would say with a smile. "By the way, what was your favorite subject?" Takako admired his dignified bearing and seemingly kind nature. More than anything, she enjoyed the work, which felt more like play than labor. She even began to imagine herself as his private secretary, eventually earning the respect of the many other servants.

This went on for a week. During that time, however, Takako noticed something unsettling: the three or four beautiful girls who had been working there when she arrived had vanished one by one. After a week, not a single one remained. The typist, a graduate of a women's technical college, disappeared after only four days. Even the girl who had first introduced Takako to the household seemed to have slipped away from the mansion unnoticed.

One night, a week after her arrival, Takako was lost in a book in her room when there was a knock at the door. Straining her ears to hear who would visit at such a late hour, she recognized her employer’s voice calling, "Ms. Iwasa?"
"Are you awake?"
"Yes, just a moment. I’ll open the door."
Takako let him in. Since he had visited the room many times before, she didn't think much of it.
"Is something the matter?" she asked.
"Oh, nothing important, really. I just thought I’d like to have a little chat."
But as he spoke, the conversation took a dark turn. He began to steer the talk toward such lewd subjects that the innocent Takako flushed deep crimson. Suddenly, he lunged for her, grabbing her hand and trying to pull her toward him. She fought back with everything she had.
With her hair in disarray and her feet bare, she fled the mansion into the terrifyingly late, freezing winter night.

[Middle Section: Hyakue's Ambition]
**I. The Downfall of a Woman who Dreamed of Stardom**
Having graduated from the local girls' school and returned to her rural home, Hyakue’s longing for the glamorous life of the capital burned within her like a wildfire. Every day felt like an agonizing waste, as if she were simply rotting away in the countryside. She viewed the prospect of an ordinary marriage as the ruin of her life and refused every matchmaker's proposal.

One day, while idly browsing a newspaper, her eyes were suddenly arrested by an advertisement: *"RECRUITING NEW MOVIE ACTRESSES. High school graduates with a passion for stardom welcome. Rural applicants encouraged. Send resume and recent photo immediately. Results will be mailed."*

Hyakue read the words over and over. In her mind, she had already cast herself as a star candidate. *I graduated with honors. I’m healthy. I have an aptitude for music and literature... and with my looks and figure, I can definitely make it as a movie star.*
Caught up in the fantasy, she already felt like a celebrity. She sat at her desk, took up her pen, and wrote the name "Miyagi Hyakue." It already sounded like a stage name to her.

She immediately dispatched a long letter of application along with her resume and a photograph. In the days that followed, she was so restless her family began to grow suspicious. When the reply finally came from "XX Production," Hyakue was ecstatic. The letter, written in elegant script that made her heart race, stated they wanted to hire her as an "ideal star candidate." It even included a map from Ueno Station to their office.

Knowing her parents would object instantly if she asked, she decided to run away. She secretly prepared her kimonos and withdrew her savings. Telling her family she was visiting a friend, she boarded a train bound for Ueno. Though she felt a pang of loneliness as she left her hometown behind, the feeling was quickly swept away by her glittering dreams of fame. Upon arriving at Ueno Station, she hopped into a bicycle taxi and hurried toward the address of XX Production. She finally arrived at a cramped, dingy back alley...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Hierarchy:** The page is divided into distinct narrative segments. The most prominent feature is the center title set in bold, larger type: "一、スターを夢みた彼女の末路" (1. The Downfall of a Woman Who Dreamed of Stardom). This indicates a serialized column or a series of numbered cautionary tales.
*   **Typography:** The text uses traditional vertical typesetting (tategaki), reading from right to left. It employs a standard serif font common in mid-century Japanese printing. 
*   **Furigana:** Some kanji (like 跣足/hadashi, 生甲斐/ikigai, 軀/karada) are accompanied by furigana (reading aids), suggesting the magazine was aimed at a general audience, including young women or those with a standard education level.
*   **Visual Elements:** There is a horizontal line separating the main story from a shorter anecdotal piece at the bottom. The use of "××プロダクション" (XX Production) is a common editorial convention (fuseji) used to anonymize names while implying they are real entities or to avoid legal issues.
*   **Illustration:** The bottom left features a small line-art illustration of a woman, possibly the protagonist of the lower story, reflecting the melodramatic tone.
*   **Formatting:** The use of dashes (――) for emphasis in the newspaper advertisement within the story helps distinguish the "text within the text."

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-war 1940s-1950s):** The mention of "High school graduates" (高女卒/Kojo-sotsu), "Ueno Station" as the gateway to Tokyo for rural migrants, and "bicycle taxis" (rintaku) strongly points to the immediate post-war era. "Rintaku" were a common sight in Japanese cities in the late 1940s when fuel was scarce.
*   **The "Star" Dream:** During this period, the Japanese film industry (Golden Age of Cinema) was a primary source of glamour and escapism. Many young women from the countryside dreamed of becoming the next "New Face" star, often falling prey to "talent scouts" or fake production companies—a social issue frequently reported in the press.
*   **Urban-Rural Divide:** The text highlights a common trope: the "pure" but naive rural girl seeking "modern" life in the city, only to face exploitation. The "capital" (miyako) represents both a dream and a site of corruption.
*   **Social Morality:** These stories served as "moral guidance" (cautionary tales), warning women about the dangers of vanity and the importance of parental advice. The lower story about the woman at the festival losing her body due to gambling is a particularly harsh moralizing anecdote.
*   **Terminology:** "Joshisen" (Women's technical/professional school) refers to higher education for women before the 1947 educational reforms.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **末路 (Matsuro):** Literally "the end of the road," but often used to mean a tragic or pathetic downfall.
*   **初心 (Ubu):** Innocent, naive, or unsophisticated. Specifically used here to describe the girl's shock at lewd talk.
*   **有頂天 (Uchoten):** Ecstatic, in seventh heaven. Originally a Buddhist term for the highest of the heavens.
*   **リンタク (Rintaku):** A portmanteau of "bicycle" (jitensha) and "taxi." These were cycle-rickshaws used heavily in the post-war period.
*   **でんすけ (Densuke):** Referring to "Densuke-sukui" or "Densuke-tobaku," a type of street gambling game common at festivals.
*   **掛茶屋 (Kakejaya):** A temporary, simple teahouse often set up at festivals or along roadsides.
*   **すってんてん (Sutten-ten):** Onomatopoeic slang for being "cleaned out" or losing all one's money.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Price of Vanity:** Both stories center on women whose desires (for fame or for winning at gambling) lead them into dangerous situations.
*   **Sexual Exploitation:** The subtext is very clearly about sexual predation. The first story depicts workplace sexual harassment/assault, while the second (Hyakue) sets up a "casting couch" or human trafficking trap. The bottom anecdote explicitly mentions gang rape as a consequence of gambling.
*   **Distrust of the "Modern":** The stories implicitly promote traditional values (listening to parents, staying in the countryside, modest marriage) by portraying the pursuit of "modern" dreams as a path to destruction.
*   **Sensationalism:** While framed as moral warnings, the graphic nature of the "nine men" anecdote suggests the magazine also traded in "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) sensationalism to attract readers.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Short Story, Editorial, Cautionary Tale, Moral Drama.
*   **Primary Tags:** Post-war Japan, Cinema, Rural-to-Urban migration, Sexual Danger, Moralizing, Melodrama.
*   **Classification:** Social Commentary/Fiction.
