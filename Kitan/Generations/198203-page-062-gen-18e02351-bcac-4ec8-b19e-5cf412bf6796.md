おゆきさんはせつなそうに白い手で防ごうとしたが、
「どっこい、そうはさせねえよ」と、親方は枕元にあったヨレヨレの帯を口でくわえ、か弱い両手首を握ったと思うと、後ろへねじり、きりきりと縛ってしまった。

**縛られる隣室の婦人**

「静かにしてちょうだい……もう手向かいしませんから……お隣に聞こえちゃいけないでしょ」

おゆきさんは後ろ手に縛られ、浴衣をすっかり剥がれた裸のまま、ゴロリと転がされた。
「やっぱり、それ……ここんところをこうして……イタズラしてやったのよ。そうしたらネチョネチョ、あったけえ汗があふれてなァ……どうでえ、悔しいか！……」

源さんは、ますます執念深くなってゆく。
おゆきさんの白い肢体はこうして長い間、アザのつくほどつねられたり、くわえさせられたり、さざえのような拳骨（げんこつ）で所きらわず叩かれどおしだった。
しまいには、毛だらけの真っ黒な尻を、ヒヤシンスの花弁のような顔の上にのせられる始末である。

「どうだい、往生したろう……え？……おゆき。かわいいなァ手前（てめえ）は……なんてかわいい面（つら）ァしてやがるんだ……さ、こうしてやろうか……痛えか？　うん？」

親方は再びおゆきさんを抱き上げ、むっちりと大きめな乳房を指でグイグイ押している。それから熊手のような掌（てのひら）を広げ、その肉の塊を強くつかむ。大きな掌なので、乳房がそのまま溶けてしまうようだ。

「アノ……もう……わかったわ……あたし、疲れたの……もう……寝ましょうね…」
「よしよし、じゃ、その前に」

おゆきさんは何か言おうとしたが、髭に埋まった親方の唇にしっかりと蓋（ふた）をされて声が出ない。
「サァ、そのちっちゃなお手手で少しかわいがってくんな」

おゆきさんの白い手が、親方にがっちりつかまれて誘導されてゆく。
やがて、彼女は後ろ手のまま、夜具の中へ荒々しく引きずり込まれた。
「ああ……許して……もう……許して…ああ……ああ……」

おゆきさんの絶え入るような呻きが澄んできこえる。
あとは、ただチュッチュッと吸う親方の唇の音だけだった。

### 3️⃣ Literal Translation (Semantic Fidelity)

## Literal English Translation

Oyuki-san looked wretched as she tried to defend herself with white hands, but,
"Heave-ho, I won't let you do that," the Boss said, holding a worn-out sash that was by the pillow in his mouth; just as I thought he grasped her frail wrists, he twisted them behind her and bound them tightly.

**The Bound Woman in the Room Next Door**

"Please be quiet... I won't resist anymore... It mustn't be heard by the neighbors, right?"

Oyuki-san was bound with her hands behind her back, and, completely stripped of her yukata and naked, she was rolled over with a thud.
"Just as I thought, that... right here, I'm doing this... teasing you like this. And then, sticky-sticky, warm sweat came overflowing... how about that, are you frustrated!..."

Gen-san [the Boss] becomes more and more vindictive.
Oyuki-san's white limbs were thus, for a long time, pinched until bruised, forced to hold things in her mouth, and continuously beaten indiscriminately with turban-shell-like fists.
In the end, it was a situation where [he] placed his hairy, pitch-black buttocks on top of her face, which was like the petals of a hyacinth.

"How's that, you've given up, right... eh? ...Oyuki. You're cute, you [bastard]... what a cute face/mug you're making... Come now, shall I do this... does it hurt? Hmm?"

The Boss lifted Oyuki-san up again, and is forcefully pressing her plump, rather large breasts with his fingers. Then, spreading his palm like a rake, he strongly grabs that lump of flesh. Because it is a large palm, it seems as if the breast will melt right there.

"Um... enough... I understand... I, am tired... let's sleep now, okay..."
"There there, well then, before that."

Oyuki-san tried to say something, but her mouth was firmly capped by the Boss's beard-buried lips, and no voice comes out.
"Here, with those tiny hands, give me a little affection."

Oyuki-san's white hands are firmly grabbed by the Boss and are being guided.
Before long, she was dragged roughly into the bedding, still with her hands behind her back.
"Ah... forgive me... enough... forgive me... ah... ah..."

Oyuki-san's faint, dying-away moans can be heard clearly.
After that, it was just the sound of the Boss's lips sucking, *chuchu*.

**The Wife Cultivating the Buds of Masochism**

--The night was dawning white.
While being overwhelmed by this terrifying scene, I realized at this moment that I had forgotten something terrible/important.
"One is not born a woman, one becomes one," Beauvoir says, but even regarding a masochist, it is never something innate; personal taste is elevated to an experience of self-intoxication, and that comes to hold the right of choice within sexual techniques -- I had forgotten this process.

Mitsuko, while seeing and hearing the rough conduct of the Boss and his wife every day, must have been nurturing that bud of a masochist. In the first place, in our case, Mitsuko clearly possessed signs of narcissism that could not endure the monotony of normal sexual behavior.
She was always in front of the mirror, entranced and charmed by her own limbs. Opening and closing the spaces between her fingers, enjoying the faint sweat on her breasts which were like small inverted bowls... that was already [a sign that] she could not sufficiently caress her own beauty by herself...

## Literary English Translation

Oyuki attempted to defend herself with her pale hands, looking utterly wretched, but—
"Heave-ho, I’m not letting you get away with that," the Boss grunted. Clamping a frayed obi sash found by his pillow between his teeth, he seized her frail wrists, twisted them behind her back, and bound them tight with a cruel efficiency.

**The Bound Woman Next Door**

"Please, keep it down... I won't fight you anymore... We mustn't let the neighbors hear, right?"

Oyuki, now bound with her hands behind her back and stripped completely naked of her yukata, was tumbled roughly onto the floor.
"I knew it... right here... I'm just teasing you a little. Look at that sticky, warm sweat pouring out of you... How's that? Frustrated, are we?"

Gen-san—the Boss—grew increasingly vindictive.
For a long time, Oyuki’s white limbs were pinched until they bruised, she was forced to service him with her mouth, and she was beaten indiscriminately with fists as hard as turban shells. Finally, he went so far as to press his hairy, pitch-black buttocks directly onto her face, delicate as the petals of a hyacinth.

"How's that? You've resigned yourself to it, haven't you... eh? ...Oyuki. You're cute, you bitch... making such a cute face for me... Here, shall I do this... does it hurt? Hmm?"

The Boss lifted Oyuki up once more, his fingers digging forcefully into her plump, ample breasts. Spreading a palm as wide as a rake, he grasped the mounds of flesh violently. His hand was so large it looked as though her breast might simply melt away within it.

"Um... enough... I understand... I'm tired... let's just sleep now..."
"There, there. Well then, one last thing before bed."

Oyuki tried to protest, but her lips were sealed tight by the Boss’s mouth, buried deep in his beard, stifling her voice.
"Come on, give me a little love with those tiny hands of yours."

The Boss gripped Oyuki’s white hands firmly, guiding them where he wanted.
Before long, still with her hands tied behind her back, she was dragged roughly into the futon.
"Ah... forgive me... stop... forgive me... ah... ah..."

Oyuki’s faint, dying moans drifted clearly through the air.
After that, silence fell, broken only by the wet *tsk-tsk* sound of the Boss’s lips.

**The Wife Cultivating the Buds of Masochism**

—The night was breaking into a pale dawn.
Even as I lay overwhelmed by this terrifying scene, I realized I had overlooked something crucial.
"One is not born a woman, but becomes one." So says Simone de Beauvoir. But the same is true of the masochist; it is never innate. Rather, personal predilections are elevated to an experience of self-intoxication, eventually gaining the power of choice within the realm of sexual technique—I had forgotten this very process.

Mitsuko, through daily exposure to the rough intimacy of the Boss and his wife next door, must have been nurturing the buds of her own masochism. From the start, Mitsuko clearly possessed signs of a narcissism that could not endure the monotony of normal sexual activity.
She was always before the mirror, entranced by her own body. Spreading her fingers, admiring the faint sheen of sweat on breasts shaped like small inverted bowls... it was the behavior of someone who could no longer sufficiently caress her own beauty by herself...

### 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

```markdown
## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Genre:** *Kitan* / Ero-guro pulp fiction. It utilizes a common trope of the "intellectual observer" (the narrator) witnessing "low-class" vitality and violence (the neighbors), leading to the corruption or awakening of a nearby female figure (the wife).
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Part 1 (Voyeurism):** A "reportage" style scene. High sensory details (sounds, tactile descriptions like "sticky sweat"). The dialogue is rough, dialect-heavy (*shitamachi* / working class), contrasting with the narrator's standard Japanese.
    *   **Part 2 (Analysis):** Shifts to internal monologue. The tone becomes clinical and philosophical, referencing Western intellectualism (Beauvoir) to justify or contextualize the erotica.
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person male narrator ("Boku"). He acts as the bridge between the reader and the taboo content, framing the voyeurism as a psychological realization rather than mere perversion.
*   **Character Archetypes:**
    *   **The Boss (Gen-san):** Animalistic, virile, working-class, dominant.
    *   **Oyuki:** The submissive victim/partner, described with floral imagery ("hyacinth").
    *   **Mitsuko:** The latent masochist, described via narcissism.

### 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Notes

```markdown
## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Simone de Beauvoir & Postwar Japan:** *The Second Sex* (Le Deuxième Sexe) was translated into Japanese in **1953** (Showa 28). It was a massive intellectual boom. Quoting Beauvoir in an S&M magazine places this text in the **mid-to-late 1950s**. It reflects the "Kasutori" culture's habit of mixing high-brow philosophy with low-brow smut to evade censorship or feign artistic merit.
*   **Housing Conditions:** The premise relies on "thin walls" (*kabe ga usui*). Postwar housing shortages meant many couples lived in subdivided apartments or *doya* where privacy was nonexistent. Hearing neighbors have sex was a common trope in Showa literature (*yobai* culture modernized into apartment voyeurism).
*   **Language & Class:**
    *   **The Boss:** Uses rough endings ("~neeyo", "~yagaru", "temee"). He represents the rough-hewn artisan or laborer class.
    *   **Narrator:** Uses standard, educated Japanese (*Boku*), separating himself intellectually from the act while enjoying it vicariously.
*   **Hyacinth (Yashinsu):** A somewhat exotic flower for the time, emphasizing the woman's delicate/white features against the "black" roughness of the man.

### 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

```markdown
## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Parent/Boss (Oyakata / 親方):** Literally "parent person" or "master." Usually a master craftsman, foreman, or stable master (sumo). Implies absolute authority over the household/apprentices.
*   **M-sei (M性):** "M-nature." The explicit use of "M" for Masochism indicates the permeation of sexology terms into popular culture by this era.
*   **Turban Shell (Sazae / さざえ):** Used to describe a fist ("sazae no yō na genkotsu"). Implies hard, knobbly, bony, and painful.
*   **Rake (Kumade / 熊手):** Describes the hand. Implies a tool for gathering/scratching, suggesting rough, grasping greed.
*   **Yore-yore (ヨレヨレ):** Onomatopoeia for worn-out, tattered, or shapeless (clothing).
*   **Necho-necho (ネチョネチョ):** Mimetic word for sticky/viscous texture (sweat/fluids). High sensory eroticism.
```

---

### 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

```markdown
## Themes & Subtext

*   **Intellectualized Perversion:** The text creates a feedback loop: The raw violence of the lower class (Gen-san) serves as a catalyst for the repressed desires of the intellectual class (Narrator and Mitsuko).
*   **Narcissism to Masochism:** The narrator theorizes that masochism isn't about pain, but an extension of *narcissism*—a desire to be the object of such intense attention that one loses autonomy.
*   **The "Other" as Spectacle:** The working-class neighbors are dehumanized slightly (animal metaphors: rake, turban shell, bear-like) to serve as a spectacle for the narrator's philosophical musings.
*   **Consent vs. Play:** While the scene is violent, there is ambiguity ("I'm just teasing you"). It blurs the line between domestic abuse and rough consensual play, a staple of *Kitan Club* fiction.
```

### 9️⃣ Content Flags (For Downstream Processing)

```markdown
## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Violence:** High (Bondage, striking, non-consensual overtones, rough handling of breasts).
*   **Fetish:** BDSM (Bondage/Shibari), Voyeurism, Verbal Humiliation.
*   **Consent:** Dubious/Ambiguous (framed as "teasing" by the aggressor, but "painful" by the victim).
*   **Keywords:** Bondage, Wife, Peeping, Masochism, Beauvoir.
