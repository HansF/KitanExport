障子の破れ目から飛び出た眼玉がぎょろりとのぞき

「やつ、留さんが、はいれー」
ガチャ〜と錠を外して
「いま飯を炊いてるところだ、さあ、上りねえ」
留吉は、美味そうな飯の匂いに、鼻をひく／＼させながら、腰を屈めて中間の三畳までやってくると、胡座をくんで、じろ／＼となんにもない埃だらけの室内を見渡した。
「ヘッヘッ、きれえなもんだろう、昨日っから売り拂（はら）っちまったんだ。どうだ、でけえことお始めようと思ったら、こういう思いきったショチョをとならなくっちゃあ駄目だ、もう、ぐいッ、と札束握ってるんだぜ、近い内に飲み屋お始める、いま場所をセンサク中だ、それさえきまりや明日からでも、へいッ、いらっしゃいやッて景気のいいところをだして、なあに俺がやったらひとに負けるもんか、友達だけでも三百人、どうだ、留さん、驚いたか、まあ店開きにやってきな、きゆつと一杯いや、銚子の二本や三本ただで飲ませるぜ」
「ほ――すまないね」
「さあ、飯だ、留さん、食いねえ、ほら、昨日買つてきたこんぶの佃煮といかの塩からがある」
新聞紙にくるんだ竹の皮をガサ〜拡げて留吉の前へ置き、せか〜と立ち上つて流しにひっくりかえつている茶碗をひとつかみ、首に巻きつけた汚らしい手拭でちよつと拭いて
「さあ、食いねえ〜」

「いつも、すまねえな」
飢えた狼のようにガツガツと、みる／＼うちに一升飯を平らげると菊三は竹の皮包みを新聞紙ごと丸めてポイと土間に抛（ほう）り投げ
「さあ忙しい、ちよいと出かけるぜ」
もう立上つて、菊三は、表の方へゆこうとする。
「あ、ちよつと、菊三さん」
「なんです？あ、用事があったんだろうな、朝つぱらからやってきて、さあ聞こうぜ、いつとくれ」
そういつた菊三は、貧乏ゆすりをしながら眼をキョロつかせている。
「じつは、困つたことが起きたんだが」
そう前置して、留吉は、女房のいさつをつかみ話した。
ふん／＼と噛みつくような勢いで聞いていた菊三は話が済むと
「なあんだ、そんなことけえ」
と、障子が響くような声でカラカラと笑った、と、たちまち真顔になつて留吉の顔を覗きこみ
「留さん、しっかりしなせえよ、おまえさんの目の前にや、いま、福の神がぶら下ってるんだぜ、よ〜しなさいしなせえよ、な、俺が知恵をつけてやるな、女つてもなあ、幾ら使つたつて石けんみてえに減るもんじやねえ、そこだ、どうだ、もういちどだけおかみさんをやって、一挙に、ぐいツと四五万握っちやどうだい」
「へえ？――そんな器用な真似できるんかい？」
「そこが頭の問題だ、なあ、留さん、頭つてもなあ、ふけばかり溜めておくとこぢやねえんだぜ」
「なあ――るほど――で？」
「で、もが、もねえもんだ、しっかりしなせよ、な、俺が知恵をつけてやるからな、さあて、おめえ、知つとるかな？水月、連れこみ専門の宿屋だ」
「あそこなら知つとる、十年ほど前一度泊つたことがある」
「そりやいい、で、そこへ男を引っぱり込むんだ。杉浦つて自転車屋の倅（せがれ）だつたな、たしか電話がある筈だ、早速おかみさんに電話をかけて貰つてそこへ泊めるんだ」
「そしてどうするんだね」
「うといなあ、おまえさんは。それからだ、あつしがついてるから安心しろ、あの近くにうどん屋があったな、

「やつ、留さんが、入れー」
ガチャリと錠を外して、
「今、飯を炊いているところだ、さあ、上がりな」
留吉は、美味そうな飯の匂いに鼻をひくつかせながら、腰を屈めて中間の三畳までやってくると、胡座を組んで、じろじろとなんにもない埃だらけの室内を見渡した。
「ヘッヘッ、きれいなもんだろう、昨日から売り払っちまったんだ。どうだ、でかいことを始めようと思ったら、こういう思い切った処置をとらなくっちゃ駄目だ。もう、ぐいっと札束を握ってるんだぜ。近い内に飲み屋を始める。今、場所を詮索中だ。それさえ決まれば明日からでも、『へい、いらっしゃい』って景気のいいところを見せて。なあに、俺がやったら人に負けるもんか。友達だけでも三百人。どうだ、留さん、驚いたか。まあ店開きにやってきな。きゅっと一杯、いや、銚子の二本や三本、ただで飲ませるぜ」
「ほー、すまないね」
「さあ、飯だ、留さん、食いな。ほら、昨日買ってきた昆布の佃煮とイカの塩辛がある」
新聞紙にくるんだ竹の皮をガサリと広げて留吉の前へ置き、せかせかと立ち上がって、流しにひっくり返っている茶碗を一つかみ、首に巻き付けた汚らしい手拭いでちょっと拭いて、

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

From the hole in the paper screen, an eyeball popped out and peered around sharply.

"Hey, it's Tome-san, come in—"
With a *gatcha* sound, he undid the lock.
"I am just now cooking rice; come, come up."
Tomekichi, while making his nose twitch at the delicious smell of rice, bent his waist and came into the middle three-tatami room, sat cross-legged, and stared around at the dusty room that had nothing in it.
"Heh-heh, it's clean, isn't it? I've sold everything off since yesterday. Look, if you're going to start something big, you have to take these kind of drastic measures. I'm already gripping a wad of bills, you see. I'll start a bar soon. I'm currently searching for a location. Once that's decided, even from tomorrow, I'll show off a prosperous scene saying 'Hey, welcome!' No matter what, if I do it, I won't lose to anyone. I have three hundred friends alone. How about that, Tome-san? Surprised? Well, come by for the grand opening. I'll let you drink a quick glass—no, two or three flasks for free."
"Ho—thanks, then."
"Now, food, Tome-san, eat up. Look, there's the kelp simmered in soy sauce and the salted squid guts I bought yesterday."
He spread out the bamboo leaf wrapping rolled in newspaper with a *gasa* sound and placed it before Tomekichi. Rising hurriedly, he grabbed a teacup that was overturned in the sink, wiped it slightly with the dirty hand-towel wrapped around his neck, and said,
"Now, eat."

"Always, sorry about this."
Gobbling like a hungry wolf, in no time at all, he finished off a large amount of rice. Kikusan then rolled up the bamboo leaf wrapping along with the newspaper and threw it *poi* into the earthen floor area.
"Now, I'm busy, I'm going out for a bit."
Already standing up, Kikusan tried to head toward the front.
"Ah, wait, Kikusan-san."
"What is it? Ah, you had some business, didn't you, coming here since the early morning. Come on, let's hear it, tell me."
Saying this, Kikusan, while fidgeting his legs, was letting his eyes dart around.
"Actually, a troublesome thing has happened."
With that preface, Tomekichi told him the story about his wife, Isatsu.
Kikusan, who had been listening with the intensity of someone about to bite, finished hearing the story and said,
"What? Is that all?"
He laughed loudly, a *kara-kara* sound that made the paper screen vibrate. Then, suddenly becoming serious, he peered into Tomekichi's face.
"Tome-san, pull yourself together. Right in front of your eyes, the God of Fortune is hanging right now. Go on, do it, do it. Look, I'll give you some wisdom. Women, no matter how much you use them, they don't wear down like soap. That's the point. How about it? Just one more time, use your wife, and in one go, grab forty or fifty thousand yen."
"Huh? Can such a clever trick be done?"
"That's a matter of the head. Look, Tome-san, the head isn't just a place for storing dandruff."
"I see... and then?"
"There's no 'and then' about it. Get it together. Look, I'll give you the wisdom. Well now, do you know it? 'Suigetsu,' an inn specializing in 'bringing people along.'"
"I know that place. About ten years ago, I stayed there once."
"That's good. Then, you pull the man in there. It was Sugiura, the bicycle shop's son, right? There should certainly be a telephone. Have your wife call him immediately and make him stay there."
"And then what will you do?"
"You're so slow. That comes next. I'm with you, so don't worry. There was a noodle shop near there, wasn't there..."

An eye peered sharply through a jagged hole in the paper sliding door.

"Oh, it's you, Tome. Get in here!"
The lock clicked open.
"Just finished the rice. Come on, get inside."
Tomekichi’s nose twitched at the savory aroma of the rice. He stooped low as he entered the cramped three-mat room, sat himself down cross-legged, and scanned the dusty, empty space.
"Heh, looks pretty clean, doesn't it? Sold every last stick of furniture yesterday. Listen, if you’re gonna make it big, you’ve gotta be willing to strip down to the bone like this. I’ve already got a fat wad of cash in my pocket. I’m opening a bar soon—just scoutin' for the right spot now. Once that’s settled, I’ll be open for business tomorrow, shouting 'Welcome!' to the crowds. When I do something, I do it right. I’ve got three hundred friends alone who’ll show up. What do you think of that, Tome? Surprised? Make sure you come for the opening. I’ll give you a drink on the house—hell, make it two or three bottles of sake."
"Wow... that’s kind of you."
"Here’s your food, Tome. Eat up. I’ve got some kelp and squid guts I picked up yesterday."
He rustled open a bamboo leaf package wrapped in old newspaper and set it before Tomekichi. He scrambled up, grabbed a stray cup from the sink, gave it a quick wipe with the filthy towel around his neck, and nudged it forward.
"Go on, eat."

"I’m always in your debt," Tome replied.
He fell upon the rice like a starving wolf, polished off an entire large portion in seconds, then crumpled the bamboo and newspaper into a ball and tossed it onto the dirt floor.
"Alright, I’m busy. I’ve gotta head out," Kikusan said, already making for the door.
"Wait—hold on a second, Kikusan."
"What is it? Oh right, you came here first thing in the morning for a reason. Let’s hear it. Spit it out."
Kikusan sat there with his legs twitching nervously, his eyes darting back and forth.
"The truth is, I’ve got myself into a bit of a mess."
With that, Tomekichi laid out the whole situation regarding his wife, Isatsu.
Kikusan listened with a ferocity that made it look like he was about to snap, but when the story was over, he just let out a booming laugh that shook the paper doors.
"Is that all? That's what’s got you worried?"
Suddenly his face went dead serious. He leaned in close to Tomekichi.
"Tome, get a grip! The Goddess of Fortune is dangling right in front of your nose. Listen to me—do it. I’ll tell you how. A woman isn't like a bar of soap; she doesn't wear away no matter how much she’s used. That’s the trick. Why don't you have your wife do it just one more time? You could grab forty or fifty thousand in one go."
"Huh? Can we really pull off something that slick?"
"That’s why you’ve got a head, Tome. It ain't just there to collect dandruff, you know."
"I... I see. And then?"
"There are no 'ands' or 'buts.' Get moving. I’ll handle the strategy. Tell me, do you know the 'Suigetsu'? That short-stay inn?"
"I know it. Stayed there once about ten years back."
"Perfect. You lure the guy there. Sugiura’s kid, the one from the bicycle shop. They’ve got a phone, right? Have your wife call him right away and get him to the inn."
"And then what happens?"
"God, you’re slow. That’s the next part. I’m backing you up, so don't sweat it. There’s a noodle shop near there, right...?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in traditional vertical columns (*tategaki*), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century Japanese printing. It uses *furigana* (reading aids) sparingly for more difficult kanji like 詮索 (sensaku) and 抛り (houri).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page features a large illustration at the bottom right. The text wraps around this illustration. The title/teaser line at the very top is slightly larger than the body text.
*   **Illustration Style:** The illustration is characteristic of "Kasutori" or pulp magazines. It depicts a woman in a state of partial undress (a common trope in "erotic-grotesque-nonsense" or pulp literature of the era) and a man in the background, suggesting a clandestine or dramatic encounter. The shading is done with fine cross-hatching.
*   **Pagination:** The number "(70)" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger serial or collection.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1950s):** This text reflects the grit and desperation of the post-WWII era in Japan. Poverty is a central theme—selling off furniture to survive and the mention of "three-tatami rooms" (tiny living spaces).
*   **"Renkomi" (連れこみ):** Short for *tsurekomi yado*. These were the precursors to modern "Love Hotels." They were often used for clandestine meetings or by sex workers. The suggestion of using a wife for money at such a place points to a "cuckold" or "pimping" plot common in dark pulp fiction of the time.
*   **Post-war Economics:** The mention of "forty or fifty thousand yen" (四五万) as a life-changing amount of money places this in the early-to-mid 1950s.
*   **Dialect:** The characters speak in a rough, "Shitamachi" (low city) Tokyo dialect, using endings like *~ne* (instead of *~nasai*) and *~kerya* (contraction of *~kereba*).

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **詮索 (Sensaku):** Searching, scouting, or prying. Used here for looking for a business location.
*   **福の神 (Fuku no Kami):** The God of Fortune. Here used ironically to describe a risky criminal or sexual opportunity.
*   **石けんみてえに減るもんじやねえ (Sekken mitee ni heru mon ja nee):** "She won't wear down like soap." A crude, misogynistic idiom used in the underworld of that era to justify the sexual exploitation of women.
*   **三畳 (San-jou):** A three-mat room. This is extremely small (approx. 5 square meters), signifying deep poverty.
*   **塩から (Shiokara):** Fermented/salted squid guts. A cheap, salty food often eaten with rice or as a snack with alcohol.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Poverty and Desperation:** The characters are literally starving ("like a hungry wolf") and living in empty, dusty rooms. This drives the moral decay and the willingness to sell/use a wife for money.
*   **Gender Roles and Exploitation:** The dialogue treats the woman (Isatsu) as a commodity to be "used" (幾ら使ったって...減るもんじゃねえ). The male characters view her as a financial asset rather than a person.
*   **Criminal Schemes:** Kikusan is the "brains," a classic pulp archetype—the fast-talking, street-smart manipulator who pushes a more timid man into a crime or a scandalous act.
*   **The Illusion of Success:** Kikusan's bravado about having "300 friends" and opening a bar contrasts sharply with his reality of living in a bare room and eating scraps.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Magazine (Kasutori-style), Short Story.
*   **Genre:** Noir, Drama, Social Realism (Dark).
*   **Themes:** Post-war poverty, crime, sexual exploitation, toxic masculinity, urban struggle.
*   **Flags:** Mature themes (suggested sex work/exploitation).
