ヘラ～の栄養失調で、難のう一つ肩にかけて大阪驛を出たが行く宛もない。長い間外地で苦労したんやから、一寸は案配してくれるかと思つていたら、舞鶴で清算金千八百二十六圓貰うたきりで、さあ自由な体や、好きな様にしなはれと、ポイと放り出された。
　でもまあわいは、月給九十圓でのんびり暮して来たんやさかい、千八百圓あつたら一年位は遊んで暮らせるわと思つたのも束の間、驛弁で、佃煮に、かまぼこ三切、コロッケ一つに沢庵二切れのバラ～弁当で八十圓ふんだくられ、ラムネ呑んだら十円や。これわあ、えらいこっちゃ。一遍飯喰うたら一ヶ月がとこの給料飛んでしまうがなとベソをかいて、まるで世の中の物価も変つたもんや、四年の軍隊生活と三年半の抑留生活で、もうわいの生涯も無茶苦茶やと、源吉は今更の如くびつくりした。
　まあ負けたんやさかいこれも仕様ないわ。
　――せやけど、シベリヤでの赤い話とはまるつきり違ごて、大阪の梅田界隈はどこで戦争があつたんやて云わんばかりのえらい景気にだまされた見たいな気がして、
　――えヽい、こうなつたら景気直しに一杯呑んだろと、駅前から梅田新道をトボ～歩き、焼酎一杯五十圓の屋台店が、高い＼として入りかね、この調子やつたら何処迄いつても同じ事やと、思い切つてとび込んだ焼鳥屋で、
「おつさん、酒一杯呑ましてんか」
　ぐつと一息に呑み乾して、豚の臓物串にさした焼鳥五本食ぼり喰つて、
「何ぼやねん」
「へい、二百五十圓戴きまつさ」
　こらあかん、金をほる様なもんやと口惜しがつたが、今更吐き出す訳にもいかず、遊々腹に巻いた千人針の胴巻から、虎の子の百圓札を身の切られる思いで投げ出して――
「へい、大きに、又どうぞー！」
　阿呆くさい、何が又どうぞや、二度といくかいなと、ベツと唾はきかけると、暮れなずむ空を見上げて溜息をついた。

短い脚に長いスカートはいて、口紅の濃い女が往来するのが妙に生々しく忘れていた異性への思慕が燃えてきて、右を向いても左を見ても無精矢鱈に綺麗に見え、えーいこうなつたらやけくそや、今夜は一遍飛田で遊んでこましたれ。――強かつた一升酒を七年呑み忘れて、一升の酒にすつかりえーこんころもちになつて、ダラリと雛のうしろ下げたドタ靴で、ヨイ～フラリ～とちどり足。それをどう間違えたか、

**【前編】**
　フラフラの栄養失調で、柳行李（やなぎごおり）を一つ肩にかけて大阪駅を出たが行く宛もない。長い間、外地で苦労したのだから、少しは便宜を図ってくれるかと思っていたら、舞鶴（の引揚援護局）で清算金1,826円を貰ったきりで、「さあ自由な体だ、好きなようにしなさい」と、ポイと放り出された。
　でもまあ自分は、月給90円でのんびり暮らしてきたのだから、1,800円あったら一年ぐらいは遊んで暮らせるわ、と思ったのも束の間。駅弁で、佃煮に蒲鉾三切れ、コロッケ一つに沢庵二切れのバラバラ弁当で80円ふんだくられ、ラムネを飲んだら10円だ。「これは大変なことだ。一度飯を食ったら一ヶ月分の給料が飛んでしまうじゃないか」と泣きそうになって、まるで世の中の物価も変わったものだ、四年の軍隊生活と三年半の抑留生活で、もう俺の生涯もめちゃくちゃだと、源吉は今さらのようにびっくりした。
　まあ負けたのだから、これも仕方ない。
　――けれども、シベリアでの「赤い話（共産主義の宣伝）」とはまるで違って、大阪の梅田界隈はどこで戦争があったのかと言わんばかりのすごい活気に気圧（けお）され、騙されたような気がして。
　――ええい、こうなったら景気直しに一杯飲んでやろうと、駅前から梅田新道をトボトボ歩き、焼酎一杯50円の屋台店が、高い高いと感じて入りかね、この調子だったらどこまで行っても同じことだと、思い切って飛び込んだ焼き鳥屋で、
「おじさん、酒を一杯飲ませてくれ」
　ぐっと一息に飲み干して、豚の臓物を串に刺した焼き鳥を五本むさぼり食って、
「いくらだ？」
「はい、250円いただきます」
　こりゃダメだ、金を捨てるようなものだと悔しがったが、今さら吐き出すわけにもいかず、腹に巻いた千人針の腹帯から、なけなしの百円札を身を切られる思いで投げ出して――
「はい、まいど！ またどうぞ！」
　馬鹿らしい、何が「またどうぞ」だ、二度と来るものかと、ペッと唾を吐きかけると、暮れなずむ空を見上げて溜息をついた。

**【本文】**
　短い脚に長いスカートを履いて、口紅の濃い女が行き交うのが妙に生々しく、忘れていた異性への思慕が燃えてきて、右を向いても左を見てもやたらと綺麗に見える。「えーい、こうなったらヤケクソだ、今夜は一度、飛田（遊郭）で遊んでやろう」。
　強かった酒を七年も飲み忘れて、一升の酒ですっかり良い心持ちになり、だらりと肩から下げたドタ靴で、ヨイヨイフラフラと千鳥足。それをどう間違えたのか、
「ねえ、ちょっと遊んでいかない？ 良い娘を紹介するよ」
　五十歳ぐらいでベッタリと白粉（おしろい）を塗り、安物の化粧の匂いをさせたエプロン姿の婆さんが、そっと近寄って声をかけた。
「ははん、こいつが噂に聞いた『パンパン』のポン引きとかいう奴だな。――いくらだ？」
「いいよ、それなら任せて。時間で500円、それは良い娘だよ」
　そう言って任せた娘が現れたのは良いが、斜視（すがめ）の上、目と目の間が抜けたように広く、味噌っ歯を剥き出しにして卑しく笑う。
「ありがとう、じゃあおばさん、いつもの場所で。後で呼びに来てね」
　これが「良い娘」か。まあ乗りかかった船だ、仕方ないと、手を引っ張られてゴミゴミした路地を抜け、トンカツ屋の横の幅二尺（約60cm）しかない階段をドカドカと登った。
　二階には三畳一間の部屋が五つほどあって、その中の一部屋だけは新しい。小部屋にトランクが一つポツンと置かれていて侘しかった。
　惜しそうに出した500円を無造作に受け取って、女は一言も言わずに出て行くと、どこで脱いできたのか、薄汚れたシュミーズ一枚で引き返し、ぼんやりと土間で立ちすくんでいる源吉に、
「あんた、遊ぶんじゃないの。なんでぼんやり立っているのよ」
　ああそうかと気づいて、泥だらけの軍靴をギシギシと脱ぎ、踵が見えるほど大きな穴の開いた、たった一足きりの、プンと酸っぱい臭いのする軍足を気にしながら――。

**[Title]**
Inside Genkichi's Money-Making Journal.
One Generation of a Great Poor Man.
Art by Ryū. Text by Tsujimura Sonezaburō.

**[Prologue]**
Dizzy with malnutrition, carrying one bamboo trunk on his shoulder, he exited Osaka Station, but had no destination to go to. Because he had suffered for a long time in foreign lands, he thought they might take care of him a bit, but at Maizuru he received only 1,826 yen in settlement money, and was tossed out with a "Well, your body is free now, do as you like."
However, as for me, since I had lived leisurely on a monthly salary of 90 yen, I thought if I had 1,800 yen I could play and live for about a year, but that was for a fleeting moment. At a station lunch box (ekiben), for a scattered bento with Tsukudani, three slices of kamaboko, one croquette, and two slices of Takuan, he was extorted 80 yen, and if he drank a Ramune it was 10 yen. "This is a terrible thing. If I eat one meal, a month's worth of salary flies away," he said, nearly crying, and realizing that the world's prices had changed completely. With four years of army life and three and a half years of internment life, "already my life is a mess," Genkichi was surprised as if noticing for the first time.
Well, we lost the war, so there is no helping it.
--However, completely different from the "Red stories" in Siberia, the Umeda neighborhood of Osaka was in such great spirits it was as if to ask where the war had been; he felt like he had been deceived.
--Eii, since it has come to this, to fix my mood I'll drink a cup, he thought, and walked ploddingly from the station to Umeda Shinmichi. A stall with 50 yen shochu per cup felt expensive and he couldn't enter; thinking it would be the same no matter how far he went, he took the plunge into a Yakitori shop.
"Old man, let me drink a cup of sake."
He gulped it down in one breath, greedily ate five sticks of pork innards yakitori, and asked,
"How much is it?"
"Heh, I'll take 250 yen."
"This is no good, it's like throwing money away," he regretted, but he couldn't spit it out now. From the Senman-bari (thousand-stitch) belly band wrapped around his stomach, he threw out precious 100-yen bills with a feeling like his skin was being cut--
"Heh, thank you, come again!"
"How foolish, what do you mean 'come again,' I won't come a second time," he spat out, looked up at the twilight sky, and sighed.

**[Main Text]**
Women with dark lipstick wearing long skirts on short legs passing by was strangely vivid, and a longing for the opposite sex he had forgotten started to burn; whether he looked right or left, they looked needlessly beautiful. "Eii, since it has come to this, to hell with it, tonight I'll go play once at Tobita." Having forgotten to drink for seven years despite being a strong drinker, he became completely "e-kon-koromochi" (drunk/happy) on a gallon of sake, with his clodhopper shoes hanging behind him, walking with a "yoi-yoi furari" staggering gait. By some mistake,
"Hey, won't you play for a bit? I'll look after you with a good girl."
An apron-wearing old woman of about fifty, smelling of thickly applied cheap white powder, approached softly and called out.
"Hahan, this is the one I heard rumors of, a 'Pan-pan' pimp or whatever they call them. --How much?"
"It's fine, leave it to me then. 500 yen for the time, she's a good girl."
The girl he was entrusted with appeared, but above her squinty eyes, the space between her eyes was stupidly wide, and she laughed vulgarly showing her decayed teeth (miso-teeth).
"Thanks, then old lady, at the usual place, come call me later--"
"Is this a 'good girl'? Well, I've already boarded the ship (no turning back), can't be helped," he was pulled by the hand through a cluttered alley, beside a tonkatsu shop, and climbed a two-shaku wide staircase with a thud-thud.
On the second floor there were about five rooms of three-mats size, and just one that I saw was a new small room, where one trunk was placed lonely and it was desolate.
Accepting the 500 yen he regretfully held out without a care, the girl went out without saying a word, and from somewhere she had taken off her clothes, she returned in just a thin, dirty chemise, and to Genkichi who was standing blankly in the dirt floor entryway,
"You, you're going to play, aren't you. Why are you standing there blankly--"
"Ah, right," he realized, took off his mud-covered army boots with a creak, and worrying about his single pair of army socks with big holes showing the heels and a sharp sour smell--.

**The Life of a Great Pauper**
*(From the "Genkichi’s Money-Making Journal" series)*

Genkichi staggered out of Osaka Station, his body wasted from malnutrition, a single bamboo trunk slung over his shoulder. He had no idea where he was going. After years of hardship in the colonies, he’d hoped the government might offer some modicum of support. Instead, at the Maizuru repatriation center, they handed him a pittance of 1,826 yen in back-pay and tossed him back into society with a curt, "You’re a free man now—do as you please."

Genkichi had once lived quite comfortably on a monthly salary of 90 yen. He figured 1,800 yen was enough to live the high life for at least a year. That delusion lasted all of five minutes. At the station, he was fleeced of 80 yen for a meager lunch box—a few scraps of preserves, three thin slices of fish cake, a solitary croquette, and two bits of radish. A bottle of lemonade cost another ten. 

"God almighty," he muttered, nearly in tears. "One meal and a whole month’s wages vanish into thin air." The world’s prices had gone mad while he was away. Between four years in the army and three and a half years in a Siberian labor camp, his life had been reduced to a shambles.

*Well,* he thought, *we lost the war. Nothing for it.*

Yet, the sheer energy of the Umeda district in Osaka felt like a slap in the face. It was nothing like the "Red" propaganda he’d been fed in Siberia. Looking at the bustle, you’d never know a war had even happened here. He felt cheated, left behind. 

"To hell with it," he spat. "If the world’s gone mad, I might as well get a drink." He trudged down Umeda-shindo, eyeing the street stalls. Even 50 yen for a cup of cheap shochu felt like a king’s ransom. Finally, realizing the prices wouldn’t get any better, he ducked into a yakitori joint. 

"Old man, give me a cup of the hard stuff!" 

He downed the sake in a single gulp and inhaled five skewers of pork offal. 

"How much?" 

"That’ll be two-hundred and fifty yen, sir."

Genkichi winced. It felt like throwing money into a bonfire. But he couldn't exactly un-eat the food. He reached into his *sennin-bari* belly band—a keepsake from the war—and pulled out his precious hundred-yen bills. He felt every yen leave his hand like a cut to the skin. 

"Much obliged! Come again!" the shopkeeper chirped.

"Like hell I will," Genkichi grumbled, spitting on the ground as he stepped back into the twilight. He looked up at the darkening sky and let out a long, heavy sigh.

The sight of women in short skirts and thick lipstick was a shock to his system. It stirred a long-dormant hunger in him. After years of deprivation, every woman he saw looked like a goddess. "Screw it," he decided. "Tonight, I’m going to the Tobita district and living a little."

He hadn't touched a drop in seven years, and the sake hit him like a freight train. Soon he was blissfully drunk, stumbling along with his heavy boots slung over his shoulder. 

"Hey there, soldier. Looking for a bit of fun? I’ve got just the girl for you."

An old hag in her fifties, caked in cheap white powder and smelling of desperation, sidled up to him. 

"Ah," Genkichi thought, "so this is one of those 'Pan-pan' pimps I’ve heard about." 

"How much?" he asked. 

"Don't you worry about that. Five hundred yen for a session. She’s a real beauty."

The "beauty" who appeared was anything but. She had a wall-eyed squint, a face as broad as a frying pan, and a row of blackened, decaying teeth that she showed off with a vulgar grin. 

"Thanks, Ma. I’ll take him to the usual spot. Come get me later," the girl said.

*Boarded the ship now,* Genkichi thought. *No turning back.* She grabbed his hand and led him through a maze of filthy backalleys, past a tonkatsu shop, and up a cramped, two-foot-wide staircase. 

The second floor was partitioned into five tiny three-mat rooms. In the room they entered, a single suitcase sat in the corner, looking as lonely as he felt. 

The girl snatched the 500 yen from his hand without a word. She disappeared for a moment and returned wearing nothing but a dingy, greyish chemise. Genkichi stood frozen in the entryway.

"Well? You coming or what? Don't just stand there like a statue," she barked.

Snapping out of it, Genkichi began to pull off his mud-caked army boots. He was acutely aware of his only pair of socks—the heels worn through to the skin, emitting a sharp, sour stench that seemed to fill the tiny room.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Visuals:** The page is structured as a "pulp" illustrated story. It features a large central illustration of the protagonist, Genkichi, looking grumpy and disheveled, surrounded by floating icons of his vices/problems (money, alcohol, erotic magazines, women).
*   **Typography:** The title uses a bold, stylized font. The text is arranged in vertical columns, standard for Japanese periodicals. There are clear section headers like "前篇" (Prologue).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "Hingō Ichidai Otoko" (貧豪一代男) is the most prominent element. The juxtaposition of the man's rough appearance with the "luxury" items in the illustration creates a comedic/satirical tone.
*   **Graphic Elements:** Note the magazine in the illustration labeled "エロ・クラブ" (Erotic Club), signaling the "Kasutori" (pulp/scandal) nature of the publication. The background shows a woman's legs in high heels, representing the "Pan-pan" girls of the era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Late 1940s (Occupation Period). The text mentions "4 years of military service" and "3.5 years of internment," placing this around 1947-1949.
*   **Siberian Internment:** After WWII, hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers were taken to labor camps in the Soviet Union (Siberia). Genkichi is a "Hikiagesha" (repatriate) returning to a country he no longer recognizes.
*   **Inflation:** The price of a bento (80 yen) vs. his pre-war expectation based on a 90 yen monthly salary highlights the hyperinflation of the immediate post-war years.
*   **Pan-pan Girls:** These were street prostitutes who primarily served the Allied Occupation forces but also local men. The "pimp" (ponbiki) in the story represents the underground economy of the time.
*   **Tobita:** A reference to Tobita Shinchi, a famous red-light district in Osaka.
*   **Sennin-bari:** A "thousand-stitch" belt given to soldiers as a lucky charm, usually by women in their community. Genkichi using it as a wallet shows the transition from wartime "sacred" items to tools for survival.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Hingō (貧豪):** A portmanteau of *Binbo* (Poor) and *Fugō* (Wealthy man). It translates to something like "A tycoon of poverty."
*   **E-kon-koromochi (えーこんころもち):** A rhythmic, slangy way of saying "feeling good" or "comfortably drunk."
*   **Miso-ppa (味噌ッ歯):** Decayed teeth, often looking brown like miso. Common in an era of poor dental hygiene and malnutrition.
*   **Ponbiki (ポン引):** A pimp or tout who lures customers into brothels.
*   **Schmiz (シュミーズ):** From "chemise," a type of undergarment. Often used in post-war literature to describe the dress of streetwalkers.
*   **Dota-gutsu (ドタ靴):** Heavy, clunky shoes (specifically army boots).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Nihilism of the Defeated:** Genkichi represents the "lost generation" of Japanese men who spent their youth in war only to return to a ruined country where their sacrifice meant nothing.
*   **Consumerist Shock:** The contrast between the "Red" (communist) propaganda he heard in Siberia and the rampant, gritty capitalism of the black markets in Osaka.
*   **Eroticism vs. Reality:** The story sets up a sexual desire (the vivid lipstick, the longing for women) only to crush it with the reality of a "low-quality" prostitute in a cramped, dirty room.
*   **Identity Crisis:** Genkichi is still wearing his army socks and boots; he is physically and mentally unable to fully transition to civilian life.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Satire, Pulp (Kasutori).
*   **Tags:** Post-war Japan, Osaka, Repatriation, Black Market, Poverty, Satire, Prostitution, Malnutrition, Hyperinflation.
