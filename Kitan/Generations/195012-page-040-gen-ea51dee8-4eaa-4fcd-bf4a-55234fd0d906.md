大変である。彼女等特有のサービスの仕方でベタ〜〜玄関まで食いついてきて、街角を曲るまで手を振つている。
　残金二万五千円。
　それから、三日おいて、また行つた。
　私が上がると、この前買つた妓が、飼犬みたいについてきた。あとの二人もやつてくる。雨が降つている。不景気で客がない。そこがツケメだ。
　前に行つた時はあまり喋らなかつたが、今日は私独特の世間話を長講一席べらべらとやつた。あることないことブチまけて、ユーモアタツプリに一時閑余もやつてヤンヤといわれ、大いにモチた。勿論、彼女等に優越感を呼び起こさせる話題もフンダンに挿入した。
　また千円宛バラ撒く。
　今夜は、別の妓と寝る。あとの二人特に前の兒の妓がヤキモチを焼いて手古ずらせたがやさしく慰さめて一室にひきとる。
　勘定は、千円と少し、めんどくさいので二千円やると、女将が出てきてべた〜〜おじぎする（これがツケ目だ）誰に聞いたのか、私の名前を二三度呼び続けながら、街角を曲るまで手を振つている。
　私は、見返りもせずにのんびり歩いた。
　そのときの辛さ、経験者でないと分らない。
　名だたる御大盡ならいざ知らず、年もゆかぬのに、僅かの遊びで千円札を惜しげもなく投げ出して、神よ、御照覧あれ。
　見送る妓達を振り向きもしないで帰つて行つた。何となしに心ひかれる頼もしい男、と思うが人情だ。素人女なら無論のこと、いくら男を喰いものにしている女郎でも、いささか考えさせられる。そして、職業意識を超越した戀情が湧きたたぬでもない。
　まかぬ種は生えぬ。
　こういう具合に金を遣いたいものだ。中には随分金を蕩盡して、結局何の効果もなく、花柳病を頂戴しているバカもある。
　その次ぎからの私の遊びは、三人の女を交替に呼んで、絶大な愛想を寄せるようにしむけた。かくすること数回今では、恰も、家族の一員か何んだかのようなもてなしぶり、アレは嫌いだ、キミ達が好きだという態度を持して、晝間も遊びにゆく。二時間で四時間分排い、お菓子をおごつたり煙草をやつたり、こういう女は、素人娘より愛情に飢えているからテもなく馴染んでくる。
　噂に聞けば、この女将は、昨年主人を無くして、今ではしみじみ寂寥を感じているらしい。（そこがツケメだ）
　以前は芸者に出ていただけあつて、大分老けているが、まだ、少しは色気も残つている。左程忌み嫌う女でもない。
　私は、この女将を考えると勇気百倍する。
　時折、私がやつてきて、妓達と、一日中、喋々喃々たる場面をみせつけてやると、女将はあまり好い気持はしていない。
　女将の心も、近頃私に傾いてきたことは確かだ。私の目的はここにあるのだ。
　しかし大望の前だ。はやる心を抑えねばならん。

三、念入りな化粧

　女将の私に対する信望は、いやましに募るばかりである。
　フトコロは漸次淋しくなつたが、妓たちが魂を打ちこんでおもてなしてくれるので、あまり金は遣わなかつた。けれど、まだ一度も女将と言葉を交さなかつた。もちろん時々は女将にせよ妓達にせよ、私の職業が何であるか、どんな性格であるかをよく知つていた。私は、ある会社の重役の息子ということにして、クビになつた会社で覚えた重役達の会話から得た資料でもつて創作的話題を彼女等に提供しておかげだつた。
　残金五千円。
　通い出してから一箇月、延回数十回そろそろ何か沙汰があるかと待つていると、或る日、突然、女将から使いの者がといういのがきて物を持つてきた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

It is great. In their unique way of service, stickily [they] follow even to the entrance, and until [I] turn the street corner, [they] are waving hands.
Remaining balance 25,000 yen.
After that, three days having passed, [I] went again.
When I went up, the courtesan I bought last time followed like a pet dog. The other two also come. Rain is falling. Due to bad times, there are no customers. That is the weak point [to exploit].
When I went before, I did not talk much, but today I did a long performance of my unique small talk, yapping away. Pouring out things true and untrue, with plenty of humor, I did a period of idle talk and was cheered; I was very popular. Of course, I also inserted plenty of topics that would evoke a sense of superiority in them.
Again, I scatter 1,000 yen bills each.
Tonight, I sleep with a different courtesan. The other two, especially the girl from before, were jealous and made things difficult, but I gently comforted them and withdrew to a room.
The bill was 1,000 yen and a bit. Because it is troublesome, when I give 2,000 yen, the Madam comes out and bows stickily (this is the weak point). From whom she heard it, while continuing to call my name two or three times, until I turn the street corner, she is waving her hand.
I, without even looking back, walked leisurely.
The pain of that time, if not an experienced person, one does not understand.
A famous big spender might be one thing, but despite not being old, for a bit of play, throwing out 1,000 yen bills without regret—God, please witness.
Without even turning toward the courtesans seeing me off, I went home. "A dependable man to whom one is somehow drawn"—to think so is human nature. Not to mention amateur women, even for a harlot who makes a living eating men, it makes them think a little. And, a romantic affection that transcends professional consciousness is not impossible to well up.
Seeds not sown do not grow.
I want to spend money in this manner. Among [men], there are fools who squander much money, and in the end have no effect, and receive venereal disease.
My play from the next time on was to call the three women in rotation, and move them to give me great hospitality. Doing this several times, now, it is a hospitality as if I were a family member or something. Maintaining an attitude of "I hate that person, I like you all," I go to play even during the day. Paying for four hours in two hours, treating them to sweets or giving tobacco; these kinds of women, because they are hungrier for affection than amateur girls, become familiar without effort.
If I hear rumors, this Madam lost her husband last year, and now seems to be feeling deep loneliness. (That is the weak point).
Since she used to be a geisha, she has aged considerably, but a bit of sex appeal still remains. She is not a woman to be particularly loathed.
When I think of this Madam, my courage increases a hundredfold.
Occasionally, I come and show off scenes of whispering sweet nothings with the courtesans all day long; the Madam does not feel very good about it.
It is certain that the Madam's heart has recently begun to lean toward me. My goal lies here.
But it is before a great ambition. I must suppress my rushing heart.

III. Elaborate Makeup

The Madam's trust in me only increases more and more.
My pocket gradually became lonely, but because the courtesans served me with all their souls, I did not spend much money. However, I still had not exchanged words with the Madam even once. Of course, from time to time, whether it was the Madam or the courtesans, they knew well what my profession was and what kind of character I had. This was thanks to me pretending to be the son of a company director, using materials obtained from conversations of directors at the company I was fired from to provide creative topics to them.
Remaining balance 5,000 yen.
One month since I started attending, total times several dozen. While waiting to see if there would be some word, one day suddenly, a messenger from the Madam came and brought a gift.
I live on the second floor of a grand mansion.
I have made perfect arrangements so it is not discovered that I am not the son of that house, so it is safe.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

It’s quite a spectacle. With that service style unique to their kind, they cling to you all the way to the entryway and stand there waving until you’ve rounded the street corner.
**Remaining Balance: 25,000 yen.**
Three days later, I returned.
The moment I stepped inside, the girl I’d "bought" last time came scurrying after me like a pet dog. The other two followed suit. It was raining, and business was slow—the place was deserted. That was my opening.
Last time I’d been quiet, but today I turned on the charm, launching into a long-winded performance of my signature small talk. I let loose a torrent of tall tales and half-truths, seasoned with enough humor to keep them entertained for hours. They cheered me on; I was a hit. Naturally, I peppered the conversation with topics designed to give them a flattering sense of superiority.
Again, I scattered thousand-yen bills among them.
Tonight, I slept with a different girl. The others—especially the one from my previous visit—threw a jealous tantrum and made a scene, but I soothed them with kind words before retiring to a room.
The bill came to a little over a thousand yen. Loath to deal with small change, I handed over two thousand. The Madam herself appeared, bowing and scraping (this, too, was part of my plan). Having somehow learned my name, she called it out repeatedly as I walked away, waving until I vanished around the corner.
I walked off at a leisurely pace, never once looking back.
Unless you’ve been there yourself, you can’t know the sting of such a moment.
It’s one thing for a famous tycoon to throw money around, but for a young man like me to toss away thousand-yen notes for a fleeting diversion—God be my witness!
I headed home without a backward glance at the girls seeing me off. It’s only human nature for them to think, *"There goes a man you can rely on, someone truly captivating."* Even for a prostitute who makes a career out of devouring men—let alone an amateur—such a display gives them pause. It’s not impossible for a flicker of genuine affection to stir, something that transcends their professional mask.
You reap what you sow.
This is how money ought to be spent. There are fools who squander a fortune and get nothing for it but a case of the "flower-and-willow disease" (VD).
From then on, I rotated between the three girls, grooming them to shower me with absolute devotion. After a few visits, the hospitality I received was akin to being a member of the family. I maintained an air of "I dislike the others; I only like you," and even began visiting during the day. I’d pay for four hours but stay only two, treating them to sweets and cigarettes. These women are hungrier for affection than any "respectable" girl; they fall for you without a fight.
Word has it the Madam lost her husband last year and is now drowning in loneliness. (That is my target).
She’s an ex-geisha, and while she’s aged significantly, she hasn't lost all her charm. She isn't a woman one would turn up a nose at.
Thinking of her gives me a hundredfold increase in courage.
Now and then, I show up and spend the whole day flaunting my flirtations with the girls right in front of her. It clearly ruffles her feathers.
It’s certain that the Madam’s heart has begun to tilt toward me lately. That has been my goal all along.
But I am on the verge of a great ambition. I must keep my racing heart in check.

**III. Elaborate Makeup**

The Madam’s trust in me only continues to grow.
Though my wallet was steadily thinning, the girls were now serving me with such soul-felt devotion that I didn't actually have to spend much. Yet, I still hadn't exchanged a single direct word with the Madam. Of course, both she and the girls "knew" exactly what I did for a living and what kind of man I was. This was all thanks to my persona: the son of a corporate executive. I used anecdotes I’d overheard from real executives at the company that fired me to weave "creative" stories for them.
**Remaining Balance: 5,000 yen.**
A month had passed since I started my visits, totaling several dozen trips. Just as I was wondering when the next move would come, a messenger from the Madam suddenly arrived one day, bearing a gift.
I live in a rented room on the second floor of a magnificent estate. I’ve taken every precaution to ensure they don't find out I’m not actually the son of the house. I'm safe—for now.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The text is presented in a vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), typical of Japanese periodicals. It is divided into columns with clear section breaks and a sub-header ("III. Elaborate Makeup").
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. Some words have "kanten" (emphasis dots or marks) next to them (e.g., the repeated "べた〜〜" and "ツケメ").
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The use of "Remaining Balance" (*Zankin*) as a recurring motif acts as a narrative device, tracking the protagonist's financial ruin alongside his social "success."
*   **Illustrations:** Two line drawings accompany the text. One depicts a woman in a kimono smoking a cigarette with a pensive expression; the other shows two women in kimonos, possibly observing something off-panel. These illustrations serve to establish the *Hanamachi* (pleasure quarter) atmosphere and reflect the "Kasutori" aesthetic—erotic, melancholic, and slightly scandalous.
*   **Pagination:** The number (41) at the bottom indicates this is a page from a larger magazine or serial.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-War 1940s-1950s):** The mention of "1,000 yen bills" and "25,000 yen" balances suggests the early post-war period of high inflation but also significant decadence for those with cash. 1,000 yen was a large sum in the late 40s (the "D-note" 1,000 yen bill was issued in 1945). 
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text is a prime example of *Kasutori* literature—cheap, mass-produced magazines that focused on the "Three Ps": Pan-pan (prostitution), Pulp, and Parody. It often featured stories of the "demimonde" (the *Fuzoku* world).
*   **The "Con" Archetype:** The narrator is a classic *poupée* or "fake" dandy—a man who has lost his job but maintains a facade of wealth to seduce women or gain social standing. His use of "creative topics" learned from his former bosses highlights the class anxieties of the era.
*   **Hanamachi Social Hierarchy:** The text illustrates the hierarchy of the pleasure quarters: the *Okami* (Madam/Manager) at the top, and the *Gi* (妓 - hostesses/prostitutes) who serve the clients. The narrator's strategy is to ignore the Madam to pique her interest, a classic "seduction" trope.
*   **Karyūbyō (花柳病):** Literally "Flower and Willow Disease," a euphemism for venereal disease (VD). The narrator’s cynical mention of it reflects the very real health risks and the gritty reality of the red-light districts at the time.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **妓 (Gi/Onna):** While traditionally meaning "geisha," in this context (and era), it refers to hostesses or women working in the red-light districts (*Akasen/Aosen*).
*   **ツケメ (Tsukeme):** Slang for a weak point, an opening, or a target to be exploited.
*   **御大盡 (Otaijin):** A grand spender; a wealthy patron of the arts or pleasure quarters.
*   **喋々喃々 (Chōchō-nannan):** An idiom describing lovers whispering sweet nothings or flirting incessantly.
*   **蕩盡 (Tōjin):** To squander or dissipate (usually wealth or energy).
*   **花柳病 (Karyūbyō):** Venereal disease.
*   **世間話 (Seken-banashi):** Gossip or small talk.
*   **長講一席 (Chōkō-isseki):** A long, performative speech or story, often used in the context of Rakugo (traditional storytelling).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Deception and Performance:** The entire narrative is built on the protagonist’s performance. He performs wealth, he performs social status (pretending to be a director's son), and he performs affection. The women, in turn, perform "service."
*   **The Economy of Loneliness:** The narrator explicitly targets the Madam's loneliness after the death of her husband. He views emotions as a currency to be traded or a "weak point" to be exploited.
*   **Financial Decay as Narrative Tension:** The "Remaining Balance" headings create a ticking clock. The reader sees the narrator’s money dwindling (25,000 to 5,000), suggesting his "con" has a fast-approaching expiration date.
*   **Misogyny and Power:** There is a strong undercurrent of male superiority. The narrator treats the women as objects to be manipulated ("like a pet dog") and prides himself on his ability to evoke "romantic affection" in professional women through calculated neglect.
*   **Cynicism:** The text is devoid of actual romance. Even the "affection" the women show is analyzed by the narrator as a result of their "hunger" and his "technique."
