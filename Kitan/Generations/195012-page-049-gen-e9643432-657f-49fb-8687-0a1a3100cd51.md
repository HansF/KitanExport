## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"...ing? I know."
I was taken aback. Because [she] was an unexpected hussy.
"Coming [following me] even to this kind of place, what do you intend to do? Well, if you regret [losing it] that much, I will return it to you. Go home quickly, you stingy fellow!"
Saying this, the woman thrust a wallet toward my nose. I, thinking "Ah!", searched my breast pocket and found the wallet was gone.
"I haven't touched the money yet, so go home in peace with it."
I fearfully received it. The woman, looking at me who was standing dazed, disappeared into the darkness.
I was disappointed, pushed the wallet into my pocket, and trudged back the way I came.
However, well, thinking it was good that at least the money wasn't taken, I arrived at the [tram] stop, and then, thinking to buy a ticket, I opened the wallet and was shocked. Only scraps of paper were pushed inside, and not a single penny was in it.
Such a terrible experience, there has been none before or since. I sold a book I had to buy a ticket, and returned to my boarding house in a miserable state.

**Pure-Hearted Tactics**
**What is Inside the Handbag?**
**Shinichi Kojima**

**How a low-paid salaryman was able to grasp love in this way—.**

"Mr. Mitsuga's ill-will, hey, return it, really return it."
Yukiko's unusually serious voice, being mindful of others, pierced Mitsuga's ear lowly and heavily. It was inside the empty office in the afternoon, but Yukiko did not use a loud voice.
"I will return it. But, for that, there is a condition,"
while saying so, Mitsuga tried to open the clasp of the nylon handbag which had a smooth touch.
"Opening it is no good, I hate it if you open it..."
The hand of Yukiko trying to snatch it back, Mitsuga gently brushed away. The low, stealthy struggle continues indefinitely...
Inside this handbag, a maidenly scent and secrets are hidden. Thinking so, somehow a curiosity to want to peek welled up. Moreover, ever since Yukiko joined the company and lined up her desk with his, this person for whom he feels even a faint affection. Mitsuga thought about various conditions for the return of the handbag.
"I won't open it. Therefore, please listen to my wish."
It is not harassment. Mitsuga's feelings of longing had begun to burn.
"Condition... what is the wish?"
Yukiko said lowly.
"Please accompany me for tea..."
"Tea, huh..."
Yukiko knitted her brows unpleasantly, clearly showing a color of refusal.
"No good?"
"Yes, today I am going on a weekend trip by the 3 o'clock [train] for Taisha. I have no time to accompany you for things like tea..."
What a luxurious story it is. For Mitsuga, who cannot taste weekend trips except in dreams, these words only bring envy and jealousy... For Yukiko, who is placed in such a situation, drinking tea probably has no more charm than a dried sardine before a fine feast... Even so, with Yukiko's situation and that salary, going on a weekend trip is an unanswerable mystery within the range of Mitsuga's thinking.
However, always moist-looking, coquettish eyes, the smelling-sweet flesh pulsing under the pure white blouse. For Yukiko, who possesses such "weapons?", she might be grasping a good fortune that the likes of Mitsuga cannot even imagine.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"…right? I know exactly what you want."
I was stunned. I hadn't expected her to be such a brazen hussy.
"Following me all the way here—what do you think you're doing? Fine, if you're that desperate for it, I’ll give it back. Now scurry on home, you stingy little brat!"
With those words, the woman thrust my wallet right under my nose. Startled, I reached into my coat pocket and realized it was gone.
"I haven't touched the money yet, so you can take it back and sleep easy."
I took it from her, trembling. Giving me a sidelong glance as I stood there dazed, she vanished into the darkness.
Feeling dejected, I stuffed the wallet into my pocket and trudged back the way I had come.
Still, I tried to cheer myself up, thinking at least I hadn't lost my cash. But when I reached the station and opened the wallet to buy a ticket, I was horrified. It was stuffed with nothing but scraps of paper. Not a single cent remained.
I have never, before or since, had such a miserable experience. I had to sell the book I was carrying just to afford a ticket home, finally limping back to my boarding house in total disgrace.

**Pure-Hearted Tactics: What’s Inside the Handbag?**
By Shinichi Kojima

**This is the story of how a low-paid salaryman finally managed to catch hold of love—.**

"Mr. Mitsuga, you're being cruel. Give it back, please, give it back!"
Yukiko’s voice was unusually grave. Mindful of eavesdroppers, her words were low and heavy as they struck Mitsuga’s ear. Although the office was nearly empty in the quiet of the afternoon, she was careful not to raise her voice.
"I’ll give it back. But on one condition," Mitsuga said, his fingers grazing the smooth nylon of her handbag as he reached for the clasp.
"Don't open it! Please, don't..."
Yukiko tried to snatch it back, but Mitsuga gently brushed her hand aside. Their quiet, secretive struggle continued.
Inside this bag, he imagined, lay the scent of a young woman and all her secrets. The thought stirred a restless curiosity in him. Ever since she had started at the company and their desks were placed side by side, he had harbored a faint affection for her. Now, his mind raced, trying to settle on the right price for the bag’s return.
"I won't open it. But in exchange, you must grant me a wish."
It wasn't meant to be harassment; rather, it was the spark of his long-held devotion finally catching fire.
"A condition? What kind of wish?" Yukiko asked softly.
"Come have tea with me..."
"Tea?"
Yukiko knitted her brows in displeasure, making her rejection plain.
"Is that a no?"
"Yes. I’m taking the three o'clock train to Taisha for a weekend trip. I don't have time for tea."
*A weekend trip.* To Mitsuga, who could only dream of such luxuries, the words were a bitter pill of envy and jealousy. To someone like Yukiko, he realized, an invitation to tea must seem as paltry as a dried sardine served before a banquet. Yet he couldn't fathom how a girl in her position, on a meager salary like hers, could afford such a trip. It was a mystery he couldn't solve.
Then again, he looked at her—at those moist, beckoning eyes and the soft, pulsing curve of her body beneath her crisp white blouse. Perhaps with "weapons" like those, Yukiko was capable of seizing a level of fortune that a man like Mitsuga could never even imagine.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout Structure:** The page is divided into two main narrative sections. The top right contains a short, self-contained anecdote (the wallet story), while the rest of the page features the title, author, and the beginning of a longer story.
*   **Typography:** The title "純情戦法" (Pure-Hearted Tactics) and "ハンドバックのなかには？" (What's in the Handbag?) are set in a bold, decorative Ming-style (Mincho) typeface. The body text is a standard vertical Mincho.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is centrally located, drawing the eye immediately. The "lead" sentence on the left acts as a hook for the reader. The illustration of a stylish man and woman provides a visual anchor for the romantic/melodramatic tone.
*   **Illustration:** The line drawing depicts a man in a suit and a woman with a Western hairstyle (likely a perm) and a patterned dress. This reflects the "modern" urban aesthetic of the mid-Showa era.
*   **Column Structure:** The text flows from right to left in vertical columns. The page uses a mix of standard narrative and dialogue, often set off with quotation marks.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-war Showa, 1950s):** The mention of "nylon" (ナイロン) handbags is a strong chronological marker. Nylon became a popular and somewhat luxury material for consumer goods in Japan in the early 1950s.
*   **The "Salaryman" (サラリーマン):** The text centers on the social class of the "low-paid salaryman" (薄給のサラリーマン). In the post-war era, this group represented the burgeoning middle class who struggled with inflation and low wages while aspiring to modern, Westernized lifestyles.
*   **"Weekend Trips" (週末旅行):** The mention of a weekend trip to Taisha (likely Izumo Taisha) signifies a level of luxury and freedom that was just beginning to return to the Japanese public after the austerity of the war years.
*   **Social Morality:** The term "abazure" (hussy) and the suspicion regarding how a young woman can afford luxury trips on a small salary reflect the gendered social tensions and moral judgments of the era. Mitsuga's suspicion that her "body" is a "weapon" hints at the "Pan-pan" girl culture or "mitsu-gu" (being a kept woman) dynamics prevalent in the post-war urban landscape.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **面喰つた (Menkuratta):** Modern: 面食らった. To be taken aback, flustered, or surprised.
*   **あばずれ (Abazure):** A derogatory term for a "hussy," "brazen woman," or "slut." It implies a woman who has lost her sense of shame.
*   **しみつたれ (Shimittare):** A stingy or miserly person.
*   **這々の体 (Houhou no tei):** Escaping in a miserable or disgraceful state; barely managing to get away.
*   **薄給 (Hakkyū):** Low pay; a meager salary.
*   **佳肴 (Kakō):** A fine dish or a feast.
*   **鰯の煮干 (Iwashi no niboshi):** Dried sardines. Used here as a metaphor for something cheap and unappealing compared to a "feast" (the weekend trip).
*   **媚めかしい (Namamekashii):** Coquettish, alluring, or charming in a slightly suggestive way.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Class and Envy:** The central conflict stems from the gap between Mitsuga's reality (low-paid, tricked by a street woman) and Yukiko's apparent luxury (weekend trips, nice bags).
*   **The Mystery of the Modern Woman:** The handbag serves as a literal and metaphorical container of female secrets. To the male protagonist, the woman's ability to navigate the world and gain "fortune" is both alluring and suspicious.
*   **Romance as "Tactics" (戦法):** The title suggests that love is a battlefield requiring strategy. Mitsuga uses the petty leverage of a withheld handbag to try and force a social encounter (tea).
*   **Post-war Materialism:** The focus on objects (nylon bags, wallets, tickets, books as currency) reflects a society reorganizing itself around consumerism and economic status after the war.
