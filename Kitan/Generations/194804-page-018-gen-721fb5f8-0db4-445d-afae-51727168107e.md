## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

From [the house], to this "Hato" [Pigeon] also cannot come because of it, for a little while more let's go play."
Mihoko, coffee while pouring, curious ears was pricking up. To Mihoko who brought the coffee, Miyo introduced Tanioka.
"Please, take your time."
"Hey, Auntie, in the second floor also play is okay, right?"
"Please [go ahead]..."
Mihoko's joyful-looking and quiet eyes, upon the excited Miyo's eyes, a strange shadow seemed to cast. Abruptly Miyo stood up, and at Mihoko's ear whispered.
"Hey, into Auntie's bed also enter is okay, right?"
"Yes, please..."
      X        X
Miyo, by force Tanioka embracing danced. It was a tango's love song.
"Teacher, you with Mother dancing I saw. It was hateful."
Miyo, into the arms wrapped behind putting strength, Tanioka's body squeezed. Tanioka was silent. Remaining in meditation, only the rhythm as if listening he was. But Tanioka's heartbeat, severely being disturbed, Miyo was feeling.
"Hey, Teacher!"
Miyo, like a snake squeezing, entire body made to tremble. Stretched up Miyo's lips, strongly Tanioka's lips were sucking. But, Tanioka's lips tremblingly were shaking. Any reaction did not show.
"You, with Mother kissing also I saw. Hey, Teacher, something say."
The small hall also, Miyo and Tanioka one pair only for being, was a desolate thing. The bed pair from a moment ago, as if escaping, the hall crossed, hurriedly went down.
"I have become tired. With a silent teacher, it is not interesting. For a while in the next room let's rest."
Miyo Tanioka's hand taking, into the bedroom entered. When Tanioka at the room's appearance in a daze was, 'clack' the door's lock put in, it was Miyo.
"Teacher, already cannot escape."
Miyo, mischievous eyes making shine while, suddenly Tanioka's neck with all strength as if breath would stop embraced. Lips joined two people as they were, onto the bed with a thud fell. Miyo's whole body with passion's flame was burning high. Tanioka lips finally separating spoke.
"Miyo-san, I your teacher's qualification lost. I tutor will quit. But, now truth I say, actually you I liked. I liked [you]."
Tanioka's passion, a dam breaking as if gushed. Tanioka's iron four limbs, gallant flesh with lust quivered. Already in sailor uniform Miyo she was not. A naked single mature woman as Miyo she was.
"You, a liar, aren't you. Hatefully so, a liar you are. Such a thing, to Mother also were saying."
"No, it's the truth, absolutely."
"Liar, liar, liar..."
Miyo, to the point of suffocating, by Tanioka's four limbs' strength was embraced, but that happiness's physical sensation was not Tanioka's skin, at the embankment [he] had stolen away, the "white line" man's that it was.
Miyo and Tanioka's dream, by busy footsteps and door severely hitting sound was broken.
This day, Mihoko, cotton fabric siphoning case in connection with was arrested, house search received. Of course Miyo also Tanioka also were arrested. Both with the black market case no relation that they had was understood, but Miyo to the Juvenile Delinquency Section was sent, a temporary investigation received, soon was released. Cherry blossoms also fell. Showa 22 [1947] May's thing it was.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Since you won't be able to come to 'The Pigeon' anymore after today, why don't you stay and play a while longer?"

Mihoko pricked up her ears in curiosity as she poured the coffee. When she brought the cups over, Miyo introduced her to Tanioka. 

"Please, make yourselves comfortable," Mihoko said.

"Hey, Auntie, is it okay if we go hang out upstairs for a bit?" Miyo asked.

"Of course, go ahead..."

Mihoko’s calm, pleasant gaze seemed to cast a strange shadow over Miyo’s excited eyes. Miyo stood up abruptly and whispered into Mihoko’s ear, "Hey, Auntie, would it be alright if we used your bed, too?"

"Yes, certainly..."

***

Miyo forced Tanioka into a dance. It was a tango—a song of love. 

"Teacher, I saw you dancing with my mother. It made me despise you."

Miyo tightened her grip on his back, squeezing his body against hers. Tanioka remained silent. With his eyes closed as if in meditation, he seemed to be listening only to the rhythm. Yet, Miyo could feel his heart thumping wildly against her.

"Hey, Teacher!"

Miyo’s entire body trembled as she coiled around him like a snake. She reached up and pressed her lips firmly against his, drinking him in. Tanioka’s lips quivered, but he offered no reaction.

"I saw you kissing my mother, too. Come on, Teacher, say something!"

The small hall felt desolate with only the two of them. The couple who had been on the bed earlier hurried across the hall and downstairs, as if fleeing the scene.

"I'm exhausted. You're no fun when you're so quiet. Let's go rest in the room next door for a while."

Miyo took Tanioka by the hand and led him into the bedroom. While he stood there, dazed by the room's atmosphere, she clicked the lock shut.

"Teacher, there’s no escaping now."

With a mischievous glint in her eyes, Miyo suddenly threw her arms around Tanioka’s neck, squeezing him so hard he could barely breathe. Their lips met, and they tumbled onto the bed together. Miyo was consumed by a blazing fire of passion. Tanioka finally pulled his lips away and spoke.

"Miyo-san, I’ve lost the right to be your teacher. I’m quitting my job as your tutor. But I’ll tell you the truth now—the truth is, I’ve always loved you. I really did."

Tanioka’s passion finally broke through like a collapsing dam. His strong, masculine limbs trembled with desire. Miyo was no longer the girl in the schoolgirl’s sailor uniform; she was a mature, naked woman.

"You’re such a liar. It’s disgusting how much of a liar you are. I know you said the exact same thing to my mother."

"No, it’s the truth! I swear!"

"Liar, liar, liar..."

Miyo was crushed in the grip of Tanioka’s powerful limbs until she could barely breathe. Yet, the physical sensation of that bliss did not feel like Tanioka’s skin at all; it felt like the man in the white-striped shirt who had taken her away once before at the riverbank.

The dream shared by Miyo and Tanioka was shattered by the frantic sound of footsteps and a heavy pounding on the door.

That day, Mihoko was arrested and her home searched in connection with an illegal cotton-siphoning ring. Naturally, Miyo and Tanioka were also taken in. While it was eventually determined that neither of them had anything to do with the black-market scheme, Miyo was handed over to the Juvenile Delinquency Section. She underwent a preliminary investigation and was released shortly thereafter. The cherry blossoms had already fallen. It was May, 1947.

**V. Excerpt from the Deposition**

**Q:** You are the eldest daughter of Nishizaki Zentaro, a company executive—Miyo, seventeen years old?  
**A:** Yes.  
**Q:** And your school?  
**A:** I am a fourth-year student at XX Girls' Academy.  
**Q:** And this "Tanioka-sensei"—is he the Nishizaki family tutor, a second-year student at the Literature Department of XX Imperial University, Tanioka Tetsuo, aged twenty-four?  
**A:** Yes, that’s right.  
**Q:** When did Tanioka begin visiting the Nishizaki household?  
**A:** Since summer vacation last year.  
**Q:** You slipped into the second-floor bedroom of the "Pigeon" tea house and locked the door. Why?  
**A:** Because I wanted to have Tanioka-sensei all for myself.  
**Q:** Why did you feel you had to make him yours?  
**A:** Because my mother had taken him from me. I saw Tanioka-sensei and my mother having an affair. His coming to the house wasn't for our benefit; it was for my mother alone. Ever since he started coming, she was always fidgety and restless. By evening, she would spend so much time obsessing over her reflection in the mirror that I could hardly stand to look at her. She’d always make it look like she was going out, but she never actually went anywhere. He wasn't my tutor; he was my mother's lover.  
**Q:** Now, now... just answer what is necessary. Did you not feel any love for Tanioka?  
**A:** No, I didn't love him. I only respected and admired him. But once I saw his relationship with my mother, I couldn't respect him anymore. I just felt... lonely, somehow. I started skipping school, met the lady who runs "The Pigeon," and then things happened with the teacher.  
**Q:** Did you have sexual relations with Tanioka?  
**A:** Yes.  
**Q:** And it was you who seduced him, correct?  
**A:** Yes.  
**Q:** Why would you surrender your purity to a man you didn't even love?  
**A:** Why? Because I hated my mother.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Format:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese vertical (tategaki) two-column layout. The font is a standard Mincho style typical of mid-century printing.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of kanji and hiragana, with some katakana for loanwords (e.g., コーヒ - coffee). Notably, it uses some historical kana orthography (e.g., ゐ - *wi* used as *i*) and iteration marks (ゝ). Small *tsu* (促音) and small *ya/yu/yo* (拗音) are often printed at full size, which was common in older or cheaper printing presses.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page begins with a narrative section, separated by a row of "X" marks from a middle section, and then moves into a formal numbered section ("Five") which signifies the start of the "Deposition Excerpt." This transition from narrative fiction to a pseudo-legal document creates a sense of "realism" or "true confession."
*   **Structure:** The narrative part uses dialogue and descriptive prose to build tension and eroticism. The latter half uses a Q&A (question-and-answer) format to provide the "confession" and resolution, which was a very popular trope in postwar sensationalist magazines (known as "Kasutori" magazines).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Postwar Era (Showa 22 / 1947):** Japan was under Allied occupation. This was a period of extreme poverty, moral confusion, and social upheaval. The "Kasutori" (trash) culture thrived, focusing on the "Three S's": Screen, Sport, and Sex.
*   **Black Market (Yami):** The mention of a "cotton fabric siphoning case" (綿布横流し事件) and the "black market case" (ヤミ事件) refers to the rampant illegal trade in rationed goods. Many people, including those from "good families," became entangled in these crimes just to survive or make a profit.
*   **The "Sailor Uniform" (セーラー服):** Mentioning that Miyo was no longer a girl in a sailor uniform signifies her loss of innocence and her transition into the "corrupt" world of adults.
*   **Imperial University (帝大):** Tanioka is a student at an Imperial University (likely Tokyo Imperial University), the most prestigious institution in Japan. The corruption of such an elite student by a high-society family scandal added to the story's sensational appeal.
*   **Coffee Shop "Hato" (Pigeon):** In this era, coffee shops (kissaten) often had private second-floor rooms (doubles as "machi-ai" or waiting houses) used for illicit trysts.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ゐた (ita):** Historical kana usage for "was."
*   **冥想 (Meisō):** Meditation or contemplation. Here used to describe Tanioka’s detached, perhaps guilty, state during the dance.
*   **白線の男 (Hakusen no otoko):** Literally "Man of the white line." This could refer to a specific uniform (like a sailor or a student with a white-banded cap) or perhaps an earlier trauma/encounter Miyo had at a riverbank (堤防).
*   **検挙 (Kenkyo):** To arrest or round up suspects.
*   **純潔を捧げた (Junketsu o sasageta):** "Offered one's purity"—a euphemism for losing one's virginity.
*   **にくらしい (Nikurashii):** Hateful or detestable. Used here with a nuance of jealous resentment.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Generational Conflict:** The core theme is the breakdown of the traditional family. The mother is portrayed as vain and neglectful, having an affair with her daughter’s tutor. The daughter retaliates not out of love, but out of a desire to hurt and spite her mother.
*   **Loss of Innocence:** Miyo's deliberate choice to "offer her purity" to a man she doesn't love as a weapon against her mother highlights the cynical, nihilistic attitude often attributed to the "Lost Generation" of postwar Japanese youth.
*   **Moral Decay:** The story links sexual scandal with criminal activity (the black market), suggesting a pervasive rot in Japanese society following the defeat in WWII.
*   **Oedipal Inversion:** Usually, the trope involves a child's love for a parent. Here, it is a daughter's competitive jealousy toward her mother, leading to a "theft" of the mother's lover.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Fiction, Sensationalist News (Confessional style).
*   **Era:** Postwar Japan (1940s).
*   **Themes:** Family Scandal, Adultery, Seduction, Revenge, Black Market, Juvenile Delinquency, Social Decay.
*   **Tone:** Melodramatic, Erotic, Cynical, Moralizing.
