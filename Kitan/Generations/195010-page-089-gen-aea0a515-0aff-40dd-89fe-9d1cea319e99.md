う処で惜しくも玉を逃がして、傳次は
自薬くそ気味で、云いがかりをつけて
来た。
「おいっ、孃はん――。大の男に突き
当つておいて一言の挨拶もせずに黙つ
て行くつもりですかい――」
ぐつと凄味をきかせて眉をつり上げ

定石を破つて、一寸相手は勝手が違つ

「オヤ、変ですね。後から来た人に私

「アレツ、ツベコベとこの女め、ほざ

悪い鼻で笑つたつもりでもないが、逆上

ゴンタ安は今更の如く、ウフウと驚い

そうした所で惜しくも玉を逃がして、伝次は自棄くそ気味で、言い掛かりをつけて来た。
「おい、嬢さん――。大の男に突き当たっておいて一言の挨拶もせずに黙って行くつもりですかい――」
ぐっと凄みを利かせて眉を吊り上げる。大抵の女ならオロオロして詫びる定石を破って、少々相手は勝手が違った。
「おや、変ですね。後から来た人に私どうして突き当たりますの。化物じゃあるまいし後ろ向きに歩けませんからねえ」
「あれ、つべこべとこの女め、ほざいたな。この俺様を誰だと思っていやがる、この界隈じゃ、ちょっとは知られた……」
と啖呵を切る奴を軽く聞き流して、ゆきはフンと鼻で笑った。まさか行儀の悪い鼻で笑ったつもりでもないが、逆上している伝次には、さも鼻で冷笑された様に見えたに違いない。
人目もあり、女に馬鹿にされては第一顔が廃るし、男が立たぬと、いきなりむずかりついてくる奴の腕をギュッと捻り上げて
「あ、たたた……」
と眉を顰めるのへ、
「ホホホ……」
艶然と笑いこぼすと、
「伝次さんとやら、あいにく相手が悪かったねえ。私は木津屋のゆき――。文句があるならいつでもおいで――」
と言いきると、スタスタと拍子木に送られて、中庭の桟敷に消えていった。
と言うので、伝次は悔しくてたまらぬが威圧されてすっかり器量を下げてしまった。で、今日も今日とて兄貴分のゴンタ安が、よし、それならこの俺様が目にもの見せてくれるとなった次第。
ペッと唾を吐いて、
「へん、世間様から、男勝り、偉い娘っ子だと、ちょっとちやほやされりゃ、どうだいあの娘だてらに反り返りようは、何だい――、着物を剥げばただの女、その辺の淫売女郎、夜鷹と変わりゃしねえじゃねえか。今に見ろ。このゴンタ安の腕のいくところで目に物見せてやるから――」
くるりと裾をからげて、唐桟の袂に弥蔵（財布）を突っ込むと、勢い込んで、さっとバタバタ駆け出した。
「急ぐんだ――ちょっとご免よ――」
ドンとすれ違いざま、手慣れた早業は早くもゆきの巾着を懐に飲み込んでいた。――途端ぐっと彼の袂を掴んだものがある。
「やい、何しやがるんだ……」
ぎょっとして腕を振り返ると、腰元のおかめが、満面に朱を注いで、死んでも離すものかと、ゴンタ安の袂を両手で握っている。
――失敗した……と思ったが、ここで弱味を見せてはならない。ぐっと胸を張ると、
「やいやい、急ぎの者を掴まえて何か用か。てめえのようなお多福に俺ら交際はなかったはずだが……」
と、狡猾な胸を据えてシラを切る。
「かめ――離しておやり……」
凛として透き通った声が絵日傘から漏れて、くるりと振り返ったゆきの顔をまともに見て、承知の事とは言え、ゴンタ安は今さらのごとく、ううむと驚いた。後ろ姿の艶な姿に引き比べて、これはまた何という相違だろう。右の眉から頬にかけて、見るも無惨に醜い――面の紫色の大きな痣。左半面の輝くばかりの美しさに反比例して、それはあまりにも醜いコントラストだった。つかんだ手を離すと、おかめは悔しげに、
「でもお嬢さん……この泥棒が、すれ違いざまにお嬢さんの巾着を切ったのを、確かに私は見たんですから……、せっかく捕まえたものを……」
「いいから離しておやり……今日はこれから四天王寺の彼岸会のお参りに行くところ――、これも何かの功徳だろうよ。そこのおじさん、僅かですが小遣い代わり、さっさと持って帰りなさい。二度と他人に手を出すと、今度は承知しないよ」
「糞ったれめ！　黙ってりゃいい気に喋りやがって。どこに盗んだという証拠があるんだい。……よくも泥棒呼ばわりしやがったな――」
安は虚勢を張ったが、心ではもはやたじたじと敗色は隠しようもなかった。
「大人しくお帰りなさい――。身のためだよ……。それともどうしても恥をかきたいの？……」
「畜生！――覚えていやがれ」
パッと裾をまくると、流石のごんた安もいつもの毒舌に似合わず、さっと人波に隠れた。

「とんだ茶番で時間が経ったこと――さあ秋の日は足が早いよ、一丁籠で飛ばすとしましょうかね――」
野次馬をかき分けて、突き出た駕籠に身を沈めると、ホイよと宙に浮いて、一目散に天王寺向かって走り出した。

（二）

放生亀に経木書き。こぼれ陽にパッと飛び立つ鳩の群れ――。
沙羅のように響いてくる見世物、覗きからくりの囃子の音。彩色の伽藍は香煙に揺らめき渡って。雨あられと飛んでくる穴銭を避けて、賽銭箱の傍らにゆきはじっといつまでもひざまずいていた。閉じた瞼の中を去来するものは、過ぎ去った日々の味気なき身の上の、桎梏（しっこく）だった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

In that place, regrettably letting the jewel escape, Denji, in a desperate mood, came to pick a quarrel.
"Hey, young lady. Having bumped into a grown man, do you intend to go silently without a word of greeting?"
Forcefully putting on a threatening air, he raised his eyebrows. Breaking the standard pattern where most women would flutter about and apologize, for a moment the opponent's strategy was different.
"Oh, how strange. Why would I bump into someone who came from behind? I am not a monster; I cannot walk backwards."
"What? Prattling on, this woman, she babbled. Who do you think this 'I' is? In this neighborhood, somewhat known..."
Lightly ignoring the guy shouting defiance, Yuki laughed "Hmph" with her nose. Not that she intended to laugh with an ill-mannered nose, but to the frantic Denji, it must have surely appeared as if she were sneering with her nose.
There were people's eyes, and being made a fool of by a woman, first of all, his face would be ruined, and his manhood wouldn't stand; suddenly the guy who came lunging at her—she twisted his arm hard and—
"Ah, ow-ow-ow..."
While he grimaced,
"Ho-ho-ho..."
Spilling a charming laugh, she said,
"Denji-san or whatever, unfortunately, your opponent was bad (you picked the wrong person). I am Yuki of Kizuya. If you have a complaint, come anytime."
When she finished saying this, accompanied by the "clack-clack" of wooden clappers, she disappeared into the courtyard seating.
So it was said, Denji was so frustrated he couldn't stand it, but being overawed, he completely lost face. So, today of all days, his older-brother-figure Gonta-yasu decided, "Alright, then I will show her something."
With a "ptui" spitting,
"Hmph, from the world (society), being called 'man-surpassing' (tomboyish) or a 'great girl,' and being pampered a little—how about that girl, acting so haughty? What is she? Strip off the clothes and she's just a woman, no different from the streetwalking prostitutes around here. Just you wait. In a place where this Gonta-yasu's arm reaches, I'll make her lose face."
Quickly tucking up his hem and sticking a wallet into the sleeve of his cotton kimono, with high spirits, he dashed out "clatter-clatter."
"I'm in a hurry! Excuse me!"
At the moment of bumping into her, his practiced fast-work had already swallowed Yuki's drawstring bag into his breast pocket. Right then, something grabbed his sleeve hard.
"Hey, what are you doing!?"
Turning around startled, the maid Okame, with her whole face flushed red, was gripping Gonta-yasu's sleeve with both hands as if she wouldn't let go even if she died.
"I failed..." he thought, but he must not show weakness here. Puffing out his chest,
"Hey, hey, you grab a person in a hurry—what do you want? I don't believe I had any association with a plain-faced woman like you..."
And with a cunning heart, he feigned innocence.
"Kame—let him go..."
A dignified and clear voice leaked from the sunshade umbrella, and looking directly at Yuki's face as she turned around, Gonta-yasu, even though he knew about it, was surprised anew, "Ooh." Compared to the glamorous appearance of her back, what a difference this was. From the right eyebrow to the cheek, a hideously ugly—large purple birthmark on her face. In inverse proportion to the brilliance of the left half of her face, it was an all-too-ugly contrast. Releasing the hand she held, Okame, looking regretful, said:
"But Miss... this thief, at the moment of passing, he cut Miss's drawstring bag, I surely saw it... even though I finally caught him..."
"It is fine, let him go. Today we are going to worship at the Higan ceremony of Shitenno-ji—this too must be some kind of merit (good deed). You there, mister, it's a small amount but instead of pocket money, take it and go home quickly. If you lay a hand on others again, I will not be so forgiving next time."
"You piece of dung! Talking so big just because I'm staying quiet. Where is the proof that I stole? How dare you call me a thief—"
Yasu bluffed, but in his heart, he was already faltering and the color of defeat was unmistakable.
"Go home quietly. It's for your own sake. Or do you want to be disgraced no matter what?"
"Dammit! Remember this!"
Quickly flipping his hem, even the usual Gonta-yasu, unlike his usual poisonous tongue, vanished quickly into the crowd.
"What a farce, and time has passed—look, the autumn sun is fast, let's fly in a palanquin (kago)—"
Pushing through the onlookers, sinking her body into a waiting palanquin, with a "hoi-yo" it floated in the air and started running towards Tennoji at full speed.

(II)

Release turtles with wooden slips. A flock of pigeons flying up in the dappled sunlight.
The sound of side-shows and peep-boxes echoing like the sound of the sala tree (music). The colorful temple buildings shimmering in incense smoke. Avoiding the small coins flying like rain and hail, Yuki remained kneeling by the offertory box for a long time. What came and went inside her closed eyelids were the shackles of her cheerless physical existence of the past.
Born as the third daughter of the cotton wholesaler Hiranoya, through an arrangement between parents, her intelligence was recognized and she became the adopted daughter of Kizuya Seibei; however, her happiness did not last three years. Since her adoptive father died when she was fifteen, a hideous dispute over the succession of the headship had been swirling around and wrapping itself tightly around Yuki. The secret maneuvers of the adoptive mother's faction and the annoying meddling of relatives were nothing but bothersome to Yuki in her adolescence.
Added to that sadness was the fact that the visits of Genjiro, the second son of Itogen, who was destined to become her husband by adoption, had recently stopped completely. The hideous dispute between relatives was, for the clean-handed Genjiro, too painful...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Denied his prize, Denji was in a foul mood and looking for trouble. 
"Hey, lady!" he barked, stepping into her path. "You bump into a grown man and think you can just walk away without a word of apology?"
He drew himself up, arching his eyebrows in a practiced threat. He expected the usual reaction—a flustered apology—but this girl didn't follow the script.
"My, how odd," she replied coolly. "How could I have bumped into you when you came up from behind? I’m not some monster that walks backward, after all."
"Why, you little... talkative brat! Do you have any idea who I am? In this neighborhood, people know—"
Yuki simply ignored his blustering and gave a sharp, mocking laugh. She hadn't meant it to be particularly rude, but to the already agitated Denji, it sounded like pure scorn. 
With onlookers watching, Denji felt his reputation and his manhood were at stake. He lunged at her, but she was faster, catching his arm and twisting it with a sharp jerk.
"Ow, ow, ow!" he cried out, wincing.
"Ho ho ho," she laughed, a charming yet sharp sound. "Denji-san, was it? I'm afraid you've picked the wrong opponent. I am Yuki of the Kizuya. If you have a grievance, feel free to visit anytime."
With that, she turned and disappeared toward the courtyard, the sharp "clack" of wooden clappers marking her exit.
Denji was humiliated. His pride was wounded, and he slunk away, completely outmatched. But his "older brother" in the streets, Gonta-yasu, saw this and decided he would be the one to teach her a lesson.
Spitting on the ground, Yasu muttered, "Hmph. Just because the world calls her a 'strong-willed girl' and pampers her a bit, she thinks she can look down on us? Take away those fine clothes and she’s no different from the common streetwalkers in these parts. Just you wait. Once Gonta-yasu gets his hands on her, I'll show her what's what."
He tucked his hem into his belt, shoved a wallet into his sleeve, and dashed off into the crowd. 
"Move it! I'm in a hurry!" 
In the blur of the crowd, his expert fingers had already snatched Yuki's drawstring bag. But just as he moved away, someone gripped his sleeve tight. 
"Hey! What do you think you're doing?" 
He spun around, startled. It was the maid, Okame. Her face was flushed with fury, and she held onto his sleeve as if her life depended on it. 
*Damn, I botched it,* Yasu thought. But he couldn't show weakness. He puffed out his chest. "Hey, watch it! I'm in a rush. What business does a plain-faced girl like you have with me?" 
He put on his best innocent act, his eyes cold and cunning. 
"Kame... let him go." 
A clear, commanding voice rang out from beneath a silk sunshade. Yuki turned around, and even though Yasu had heard of her, the sight of her face up close made him gasp. From the back, she was the picture of elegance, but the contrast was staggering. A large, hideous purple birthmark stretched from her right eyebrow down to her cheek. It was a cruel, dark blemish that sat in shocking opposition to the radiant beauty of the left side of her face. 
As Okame released him, she complained, "But Miss! This rat cut your purse right in front of me! I saw him do it! We finally caught him..."
"It’s alright, Kame. We are on our way to the Shitenno-ji for the equinox services. Let’s consider this an act of charity. You there," Yuki said to Yasu, "take what’s in there as a small pittance and go home. But if you ever prey on another person again, I won't be so merciful." 
"You stuck-up brat!" Yasu blustered. "Talking down to me like that. You don't have a shred of proof! How dare you call me a thief!"
He tried to maintain his bravado, but his heart wasn't in it. He could smell defeat.
"Just go home quietly," Yuki said firmly. "For your own sake. Or would you rather be truly humiliated?"
"Damn you! I'll remember this!" Yasu spat. He gathered his robes and, for once losing his sharp tongue, vanished into the throngs of people.

"What a ridiculous farce that was. Look how the time has flown," Yuki sighed. "The autumn sun sets quickly. Let’s take a palanquin and make up for lost time." 
They pushed through the crowd of onlookers and climbed into a waiting palanquin. With a rhythmic shout from the carriers, they were lifted into the air and sped off toward Tennoji temple.

**(II)**

Votive turtles and prayer slips. A cloud of pigeons taking flight in the dappled sunlight. 
The air was thick with the sounds of sideshows and the music of peep-box barkers. The colorful temple halls shimmered through veils of incense smoke. Amidst a rain of small coins being tossed toward the altars, Yuki knelt by the offertory box, lost in prayer. Behind her closed eyes, she was haunted by the memories of her joyless life—a life that felt like a cage. 
Born the third daughter of the Hiranoya cotton wholesalers, she had been adopted by Seibei of the Kizuya because of her sharp mind. But her happiness had lasted less than three years. Since her adoptive father passed away when she was fifteen, a bitter and ugly feud over the family succession had been closing in on her. The schemes of her adoptive mother’s faction and the constant meddling of relatives were an unbearable weight on her young shoulders. 
But even greater than that was the sorrow of losing Genjiro. He was the second son of the Itogen family, and had been destined to be her husband, but lately, his visits had ceased entirely. To the principled Genjiro, the ugly family infighting was simply too much to bear...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Format:** The text is formatted in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), reading from top to bottom and right to left. 
*   **Typography:** The typeface is a classic Mincho style characteristic of mid-20th-century printing. It uses a mix of Kanji and Kana, with significant use of *furigana* (small phonetic readings next to Kanji) to ensure readability for a general audience.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page number "(89)" is centered at the bottom. Section markers like "(二)" (Part 2) indicate a break in the narrative or the start of a new chapter. 
*   **Punctuation:** The text uses modern Japanese punctuation marks, including commas, periods, and quotation marks, but also employs elongated dashes (――) and repetition marks (々) and onomatopoeic tildes (〜) to convey tone and rhythm.
*   **Design Features:** The columns are densely packed, suggesting a pulp novel or a literary magazine aimed at adults. The use of dialogue-heavy sections creates a fast-paced, theatrical feel.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Approx. 1940s-1950s):** The language is transitional, using some older Kanji forms (like 孃 instead of 嬢, 傳 instead of 伝) but moving toward modern orthography. The setting evokes the late Meiji/Taisho or early Showa eras, often romanticized in post-war literature.
*   **Shitenno-ji & Higan-e:** The story mentions *Shitenno-ji*, one of Japan's oldest temples in Osaka, and the *Higan-e* (Equinox) ceremony. This is a time when people visit ancestral graves and temples to perform "merit-making" deeds.
*   **Social Hierarchy & Adoption:** The protagonist, Yuki, is a "婿養子" (muko-yōshi) candidate’s partner. In merchant families (like the *Kizuya* cotton wholesalers), adopting a son-in-law to take over the business was a common practice to ensure the survival of the family line when there was no male heir. 
*   **Street Life:** The characters "Denji" and "Gonta-yasu" represent the *Edokko* (or in this case, Osaka *Kamigata*) street toughs/ruffians. "Gonta" is a traditional name associated with rascals or troublemakers in Japanese folklore and theater (e.g., *Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura*).
*   **Yotaka (夜鷹):** This term literally means "night hawk" and was a derogatory term for low-ranking streetwalking prostitutes. Gonta-yasu uses it to insult Yuki's character despite her high social standing.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **自薬くそ (Jiyake-kuso):** A variant of *yakeshiku*, meaning to do something out of desperation, bitterness, or a "to hell with it" attitude.
*   **凄味 (Sugomi):** An intimidating or threatening air/intensity.
*   **啖呵を切る (Tanka o kiru):** To speak in a sharp, defiant, or boastful manner, often associated with street toughs.
*   **唐棧 (Tozan):** A type of striped cotton fabric, originally imported but later produced in Japan, often used for everyday kimono.
*   **巾着 (Kinchaku):** A traditional Japanese drawstring bag or pouch for carrying money and small items.
*   **桎梏 (Shikkoku):** Literally "shackles" or "fetters." Used metaphorically to describe a state of being trapped by social or familial obligations.
*   **お多福 (Otafuku):** A mask of a plain, chubby-cheeked woman. Used here as a derogatory term for an unattractive woman.
*   **拍子木 (Hyōshigi):** Wooden clappers used in theater (Kabuki) or by town criers to signal transitions or announcements.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Inner Beauty vs. Outer Appearance:** The central visual element is Yuki's face—half radiant beauty and half disfigured by a purple birthmark. This serves as a metaphor for her life: high social status and intelligence contrasted with the "shackles" of her family situation and physical "flaw."
*   **Class & Gender Conflict:** The confrontation between the street ruffians and the merchant-class Yuki highlights class tensions. The men try to exert power through physical threats and gender-based insults, while Yuki maintains control through her composure and financial status.
*   **The Burden of Tradition:** The second half of the text delves into the "ugliness" of inheritance disputes. Yuki is a pawn in a larger family game, illustrating how traditional systems of adoption and succession often crushed individual happiness.
*   **Grace under Pressure:** Yuki’s decision to let the thief go as an "act of merit" demonstrates her moral superiority and her attempt to find spiritual peace in a chaotic world.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serialized Novel, Period Drama (*Jidaigeki* style).
*   **Primary Tags:** Romance, Social Conflict, Drama, Family Feud, Disability/Disfigurement, Traditional Japan, Osaka Setting.
