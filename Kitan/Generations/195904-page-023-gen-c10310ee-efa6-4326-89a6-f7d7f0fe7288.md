文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き

表現するのはむずかしいのかも知れない。

　この秀次と共にこの時代を代表する暴君は越前宰相忠直卿である。
　忠直は、菊地寛の初期の作品「忠直卿行状記」によって大変有名であるが、彼も孕婦の腹を裂いたことで有名である。
　特集・人物往来三十三年四月号の「着物をぬいだ歴史」の中で青園謙三郎氏は、
「『小山田多門は忠直の命を受けては、毎日のように人間狩りに出かけた。百姓町人を問わず、老若男女、誰でも手当り次第につかまえては、猿ぐつわをはめ、城中に引きずってきた。一家全部が珠数つなぎになって連れて行かれた悲劇も数えられないほどあった。……（中略）……
　人殺しも度重なると、普通の方法では面白くなくなるものらしい。忠直と一国はいろんな「殺しの型」を発明した。
　まず一国が最も好んだといわれるのは、妊娠した婦人の腹を切り開く型である。このため城下町や近郷近在の村々からは、妊婦がひんぴんとさらわれはじめた。福井地方にはいまでも「袖無し」と呼ぶ袖のない綿入れ羽織が婦人の保温用に愛用されている。が、これは妊婦が腹の大きく見えるのを隠すために流行しはじめたのだという伝説が伝えられている。妊婦の腹を裂くために、石の大きな板がマナイタ代わりに使われたともいう。このマナイタ石と称するのが、福井県内各地にいまでも残っている。』
とある。一国というのは美濃国関ケ原の問屋の娘で、すばらしい美女だったそうで、まさに傾国の美女というべきであろう。
　菊地寛の代表作、忠直卿行状記の最後には次のように書いてある。
『忠直卿の乱行が、その後益々進んだ事は、歴史にある通りである。最後には、家臣をほしいままに手刃するばかりでなく、無辜の良民を捕えて、之に兇刃（きょうじん）を加えるに至った。殊に口碑（こうひ）に残る「石の俎（まないた）」の言い伝えは百世の後尚、人に面を背けさせるものである。』
　この『石の俎』というのが、孕み女の腹を裂いた石のまないたである。
　福島正則は、賤ケ岳の七本槍の一人として有名な武将であるが、晩年は不幸であった。信州に配流されて無聊をかこっていたが、何もする事がないと生来の惨虐さが頭を持ち上げて来た。或る日偶然見つけた妊婦を捕えて、その腹を截ち割ってみた。彼はその面白さに酔って、孕み女を見つけてはその腹を割って打ち興じた。このうわさを聞いて恐れをなした女達は、みなはんてんを着て、大きな腹をかくして歩いた。これがはんてんのはじまりである。
　これは信州の友人から聞いた話である。はんてんと袖無しの違いはあるが、どうも忠直の話がそちらへ伝わって来たもののように思われる。
　私は先に、腹を裂かれた女の名前が伝わっていないと言った。然し、裂かれそうになった有名な人はいる。それは静御前である。
　義経には六人の女房、五人の白拍子がそばに召し使われていたが、その中で最も寵愛の深かったのが静御前であった。他の女達と別れて後も、静だけは、吉野の山奥まで連れて行ったのであるが、落人の身として、これ以上の供はかなわぬと、唯一人おいてきぼりにされた静の気持は、どのようであ

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**The disemboweling of women as appeared in literature**

To express [it] might be difficult.

Along with this [Toyotomi] Hidetsugu, the tyrant representing this era is the Echizen Minister, Lord Tadanao. Tadanao, by Kikuchi Kan's early period work "The Record of Lord Tadanao's Conduct," is very famous, but he also by the tearing of pregnant women's bellies is famous. In the special feature "Jimbutsu Orai" Showa 33 April issue's "History with Clothes Removed," Mr. Aozono Kenzaburo:
"Oyamada Tamon, receiving Tadanao's orders, every day like went out for human hunting. Regardless of peasants or townspeople, young or old, male or female, anyone at random catching, putting on gags, dragged [them] into the castle. Entire families linked like prayer beads being taken away tragedies were so many they cannot be counted... (omitted)... 
Killing also, when repeated, by ordinary methods seems to become not interesting. Tadanao and Ikkoku invented various 'killing patterns.' First, what Ikkoku is said to have liked most is the pattern of cutting open the bellies of pregnant women. Because of this, from the castle town and neighboring villages, pregnant women frequently began to be kidnapped. In the Fukui region even now 'sode-nashi' called sleeveless padded coats are loved for women's warmth. However, this is for pregnant women's bellies appearing big to hide [it] began to be popular, such a legend is passed down. For tearing pregnant women's bellies, a large stone slab instead of a chopping board was used, it is said. These called 'chopping board stones' even now in various places in Fukui Prefecture remain." 
it says. Ikkoku was a daughter of a wholesaler in Mino Sekigahara, a wonderful beauty it seems, truly a 'kingdom-toppling beauty' one should call [her].
In Kikuchi Kan's representative work "Record of Lord Tadanao's Conduct" end, it is written like this:
"Lord Tadanao's misconduct, after that increasingly progressed, is as in history. At the end, not only at will killing vassals with his own sword, but catching innocent good people, to them added a murderous blade. Especially in oral tradition remaining 'Stone Chopping Board' legend is, after a hundred generations still, a thing that makes people turn their faces away."
This "Stone Chopping Board" is the stone chopping board that tore the bellies of pregnant women.
Fukushima Masanori, as one of the Seven Spears of Shizugatake is a famous general, but his later years were unhappy. Being exiled to Shinshu he was suffering from boredom, but when there was nothing to do, his innate cruelty reared its head. One day, catching a pregnant woman found by chance, tried cutting open her belly. He, drunk on that interestingness, whenever finding a pregnant woman, cut open the belly and amused himself. Hearing this rumor, frightened women all wore *hanten* [short coats], and walked hiding their large bellies. This is the beginning of the *hanten*.
This is a story heard from a friend in Shinshu. There is a difference between *hanten* and *sode-nashi*, but likely Tadanao's story traveled there, it seems.
I earlier said the names of women whose bellies were torn have not been passed down. However, there is a famous person who was almost torn. That is Shizuka Gozen.
For Yoshitsune, six wives and five *shirabyoshi* [dancers] were served at his side, but among them the one whose favor was deepest was Shizuka Gozen. Even after parting with other women, only Shizuka he took as far as the depths of Mount Yoshino, but as a fugitive's body, further accompaniment being impossible, the feelings of Shizuka who was left behind all alone, what kind of...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Disemboweling of Women in Literature**

It may be difficult to put into words.

Alongside Toyotomi Hidetsugu, the figure who best represents the tyrants of this era is Lord Tadanao, the Minister of Echizen. Tadanao is widely known through Kikuchi Kan’s early work, *The Record of Lord Tadanao's Conduct*, and he is particularly infamous for the act of cutting open the bellies of pregnant women. In the April 1958 issue of the magazine *Jimbutsu Orai*, in a feature titled "History Stripped Bare," Kenzaburo Aozono writes:

> "Under Tadanao’s orders, Oyamada Tamon set out nearly every day on 'human hunts.' Regardless of whether they were peasants or townspeople, young or old, male or female, they seized anyone they could find. They were gagged and dragged back to the castle. There were countless tragedies where entire families were led away, tied together like the beads of a rosary... When one commits murder repeatedly, ordinary methods eventually lose their appeal. Tadanao and his consort, Ikkoku, devised various 'styles of killing.' It is said that the method Ikkoku favored most was the disemboweling of pregnant women. Consequently, pregnant women began to be kidnapped frequently from the castle town and surrounding villages. In the Fukui region to this day, women wear a sleeveless padded garment called a *sodenashi* for warmth. Legend has it that this fashion originally became popular as a way for pregnant women to hide their protruding bellies. It is also said that large stone slabs were used as makeshift 'chopping boards' for these gruesome acts. These 'chopping board stones,' as they are called, can still be found throughout Fukui Prefecture."

Ikkoku was the daughter of a wholesaler from Sekigahara in Mino Province. She was reportedly a stunning beauty—truly a "femme fatale" whose charms could topple a kingdom. At the conclusion of Kikuchi Kan’s masterpiece, *The Record of Lord Tadanao's Conduct*, the following is written:

> "As history records, Lord Tadanao’s depravity only escalated. In his final days, he did not stop at murdering his own vassals on a whim; he took to seizing innocent civilians and putting them to the sword. The legend of the 'Stone Chopping Board' preserved in oral tradition is, even after a hundred generations, enough to make one avert their eyes in horror."

This "Stone Chopping Board" refers to the slab upon which the bellies of pregnant women were sliced open.

Fukushima Masanori, famed as one of the "Seven Spears of Shizugatake," also met a miserable end. While living in exile in Shinshu (modern-day Nagano), he suffered from agonizing boredom. With nothing to occupy his time, his innate cruelty began to surface. One day, he happened upon a pregnant woman, seized her, and cut open her womb. Enthralled by the spectacle, he began to find and disembowel every pregnant woman he could for sport. Hearing these rumors, terrified women began wearing *hanten* (short coats) to hide their bellies while walking. This, it is said, was the origin of the *hanten*.

I heard this particular tale from a friend in Shinshu. While there is a difference between the *hanten* and the *sodenashi*, it seems likely that the legend of Lord Tadanao migrated and was adapted there.

I mentioned earlier that the names of the victims in these stories have been lost to time. However, there is one famous woman who very nearly shared their fate: Shizuka Gozen. 

Minamoto no Yoshitsune was served by six wives and five *shirabyoshi* dancers, but Shizuka Gozen was his most beloved. Even after he parted ways with the other women, he took Shizuka with him deep into the mountains of Yoshino. However, realizing that as a fugitive he could no longer keep her with him, he eventually left her behind. One can only imagine the feelings of Shizuka, abandoned and alone...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left. It is likely a scan from a printed book or a high-quality magazine.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style, typical of post-war Japanese publishing. The presence of small "furigana" (reading aids) next to difficult kanji like 孕婦 (yafu/nampuku - though here likely read *harami-onna*) and 兇刃 (kyojin) indicates the text was intended for a general, educated audience but perhaps not a purely academic one.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is centered at the top. The body text is justified. There is a small decorative illustration at the top showing a samurai (likely Tadanao) with a subordinate bowing, setting a historical tone.
*   **Structure:** The essay follows a narrative structure: introducing a famous literary/historical figure (Tadanao), quoting a secondary source (*Jimbutsu Orai*), quoting the primary literary source (Kikuchi Kan), then branching out into regional folklore (Fukushima Masanori in Shinshu) and moving toward another historical figure (Shizuka Gozen).
*   **Page Numbering:** The number "23" is visible in the top left corner.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Matsudaira Tadanao (1595–1650):** The grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu. He was the second daimyo of the Fukui Domain. He was eventually stripped of his titles and exiled due to erratic and supposedly violent behavior. Whether he was truly a "tyrant" or a victim of political maneuvering remains a subject of historical debate.
*   **Kikuchi Kan (1888–1948):** A powerhouse of Japanese literature and the founder of Bungeishunju publishing. His 1918 short story *Tadanao-kyo Gyojoki* humanized Tadanao as a man driven mad by the pressures of his status, though it cemented the popular image of his cruelty.
*   **Fukushima Masanori (1561–1624):** A famous general of the Sengoku period. Like Tadanao, he died in exile (in Shinano/Shinshu) after falling out of favor with the Tokugawa shogunate. The text uses his "boredom in exile" to explain the emergence of cruel legends.
*   **Jimbutsu Orai (人物往来):** A popular historical magazine that began publication in the 1950s (now known as *Rekishi Dokuhon*). The reference to the "April 1958" (Showa 33) issue helps date this text to the late 1950s or early 1960s.
*   **"Disemboweling Pregnant Women":** This is a classic "tyrant trope" in East Asian history and literature (dating back to King Zhou of Shang). In Japanese folklore, it is often used to explain the origins of specific regional clothing or landmarks (like the *sodenashi* or *manaita-ishi*). It serves as a narrative marker for "ultimate depravity" or "unrecoverable madness."

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **越前宰相 (Echizen Saisho):** A title for the Lord of Echizen (Fukui). *Saisho* is a court title (Chunagon/Sangi level).
*   **孕婦 (Yafu/Harami-onna):** A pregnant woman. The text uses both the formal kanji and more colloquial terms.
*   **人間狩り (Ningen-gari):** "Human hunting." Refers to the act of arbitrarily capturing people for sport or execution.
*   **珠数つなぎ (Juzu-tsunagi):** Literally "linked like prayer beads." It describes prisoners tied together in a line.
*   **傾国の美女 (Keikoku no Bijo):** A "kingdom-toppling beauty." A classic idiom for a woman whose beauty is so great it leads to the ruin of a ruler or a nation.
*   **無聊をかこつ (Buryo o kakotsu):** To complain of boredom or to have nothing to do; to be in low spirits due to idleness.
*   **白拍子 (Shirabyoshi):** Female dancers of the Heian/Kamakura period who dressed in male attire. Shizuka Gozen is the most famous historical example.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Nature of Tyranny:** The text explores how historical figures are transformed into "monsters" in literature and folklore. It suggests that once a person is labeled a tyrant, legends of extreme cruelty (like disemboweling pregnant women) naturally gravitate toward them.
*   **Folklore as Explanation:** The text highlights "etiological myths"—stories created to explain why people in a certain region wear specific clothes (*hanten*, *sodenashi*) or why certain stones exist (*manaita-ishi*). It links high history with peasant survival tactics (hiding pregnancies).
*   **The "Femme Fatale" Influence:** By mentioning the beauty "Ikkoku," the text touches on the common historical trope of the *bijo* (beauty) who encourages or enables the ruler's madness.
*   **Gendered Violence:** The focus on pregnant women highlights the most vulnerable members of society as the ultimate targets of unchecked power, serving as a visceral shorthand for social disorder and the breakdown of Confucian/moral norms.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Essay, Literary Criticism, Folklore Analysis.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Japanese History, Edo Period, Tyranny, Folklore, Gendered Violence, Kikuchi Kan, Legend vs. Reality.
*   **Classification:** Historical/Literary non-fiction.
