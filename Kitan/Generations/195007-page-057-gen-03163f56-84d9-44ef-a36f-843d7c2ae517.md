## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

んなことを言へば、淑女に對して失禮なばかりでなく、侮辱することになるそれに、私が氣狂いか馬鹿扱いにされんとも限らない。私だつて、彼女以上に恥しい。
　それかと言つて、夜彼女の便所の裏口に忍び込み、彼女が排泄しに来る時を待つて、汲取口から手を差し出して容器にそれを受けると言ふ手があるが、そんなこと紳士のやるべき行爲ではなさそうだ。
　私は、こゝで又全く途方にくれてしまつた。だが、然し事態は急を告げているのだ。
　一刻の猶豫も與えられない。
　——いつそのこと、彼女に会つてすべての事情をぶちまけてしまおうか。そうすれば、彼女だつて嫌とは言わないだろう。それに、彼女も、こんな話恥しいから、兩親や他の人にも口外しないだろう。えゝい、一か八かあたつて碎けろ。
　私は、遂に決心したのである。恥も何もかも捨てて。
　人間いざとなると何でも出来るものらしい。フダンあまり心臓の強い方でない私も、こう決心するともう矢もたてもたまらなかつた。
　そうなると、のろのろ走る市電が歯痒ゆくてならずたばたばと足踏みしていた。
　刈田の喜ぶ顔が、眼の前に散らついて仲々はなれなかつた。

　　四、
「こう云う事情ですからお願いです。友人の命を助けると思つて。僕だつて、恥を知つた人間です。あなたにこんなことをと思つて、何度ためらつたか知りません。でも、今の僕にはその友人の事で一杯いなのです。お願いですこの通りです」
　平身低頭して拜み倒さんばかりの私の態度を他の人が見たら滑稽さのあまり吹き出してしまうかも知れない。だが私にとつて見れば悲痛そのものであつた。
　私の額から、腋の下から、冷汗がたらたら流れた。そして、ぐつとにぎりしめた私のこぶしにも汗がびつしよりたまつていた。彼女は。私が話している間中、その美しい眉一つ動かさずじつと耳を傾けていたが、やがてその可愛らしい櫻貝のような唇がおもむろに開いて、
「で、あのォ、何かいれものをお持ちなんでございますか」
と、さすが、須磨子孃は恥しそうに頰をぽーうと染めて小聲でそう言つた。
　私は内心はびくびくと彼女の反應を見守つていたのであるが、ここまでくればもうしめたものである。成功疑いなしである。
「はあ、こゝに持参しています」
　私は、喜びに聲を震わしながら、ふところから紙に包んだ容器を取出してそつと彼女の前に差し出した。
　彼女は、それを受取ると、
「ではしばらくお待ちになつて」
と言つて立ち上ると静かに部屋を出て行つた。

　私は、ほつとして煙草を喰えるとマッチをすつた。
　しばらくすると、彼女はさき程の紙に包んだ容器をもつて入つて来た。
　私は、恐る恐る受取ると、まだほんのりと温かさが容器と包み紙を通して感じられた。
　歸りがけた須磨子孃は、
「この事は誰にも口外しないで下さいね」
と、言つた。
「それはもう」
　私は、幾過も幾過も禮を言つて、彼女の家を辭したのである。
　家に帰ると、私はしばらくその須磨子孃の美しいからだから出た透明の液体に見入つていたが、それを容器ごと電熱器にかけて刈田の所から持つて来た高貴薬（？）をその中にほり込んでかきまぜた。
　やがて、液体は温氣をたててぐつぐつと煮え立ち始めた。そして、三十分もたつたと思われる頃、その液体は眞赤に変色したのである。これには、私もいささか驚いてしまつたのであるが科學的に考えれば、その液体は酸性であるからその薬の成分の何かと化學的な変化を起したのではないかと思う。
　これを何も知らない人が見たら、神様の御利益があらたかなのだと、余計なもつたいながるかも知れない。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

If I say such things, toward a lady [it would be] not only rude but would become an insult. In addition, I [might] not limited to be treated as a madman or a fool. Even for me, it is more shameful than for her.
On the other hand, there is the method of sneaking into the back door of her toilet at night, waiting for the time she comes to excrete, and sticking a hand out from the collection opening (vault opening) to receive it in a container, but such a thing does not seem to be an act a gentleman should do.
I, here, again completely became at a loss. But, however, the situation is announcing urgency.
Not even a moment of delay is given.
—Rather, shall I meet her and spill all the circumstances? If I do so, even she probably won't say "no." Besides, she, because such a story is shameful, probably won't disclose it to parents or other people. Ei! All or nothing, hit it and break (sink or swim).
I finally reached a decision. Throwing away shame and everything else.
Humans, when it comes down to it, seem to be able to do anything. Even I, who am usually not a person with a very strong heart (brave), once I decided this, I could no longer be still.
When it became so, the slowly running city tram was frustrating and I was impatiently stamping my feet.
Karida's happy face flickered before my eyes and would not easily leave.

IV.
"Because it is such circumstances, I beg you. Think of it as saving a friend's life. Even I am a person who knows shame. Thinking of [asking] such a thing of you, I don't know how many times I hesitated. But, right now, I am full of thoughts for that friend. Please, I beg you like this."
My attitude of bowing low and practically praying—if other people saw it, they might burst out laughing because of the absurdity. But for me, it was grief itself.
From my forehead, from under my armpits, cold sweat flowed drip-drip. And, in my tightly clenched fists, sweat was also thoroughly pooled. She, during the whole time I was talking, without moving a single one of her beautiful eyebrows, was intently inclining her ear, but eventually those lovely cherry-shell-like lips slowly opened and,
"So, um, do you have some kind of container with you?"
So, as expected, Miss Sumako, looking ashamed, stained her cheeks glowing red and said so in a small voice.
I, in my heart, was nervously watching her reaction, but if it has come this far, then "I've got it." Success is without doubt.
"Yes, I have brought it here."
I, while trembling my voice with joy, took out a container wrapped in paper from my pocket and softly offered it before her.
She, when she received it, said,
"Then please wait for a while,"
and standing up, quietly left the room.

I, feeling relieved, lit a cigarette and struck a match.
After a while, she came in carrying the container wrapped in the paper from earlier.
I, when I received it fearfully, still slightly warmth could be felt through the container and the wrapping paper.
Miss Sumako, as I was leaving, said,
"Please do not disclose this matter to anyone, okay?"
"Of course."
I, saying thanks many times, many times, left her house.
When I returned home, for a while I was gazing at the transparent liquid that came out from Miss Sumako's beautiful body, but I put it container and all on an electric heater and threw into it the 'noble medicine' (?) I brought from Karida's place and stirred it.
Soon, the liquid began to steam and boil bubble-bubble. And, around the time I thought thirty minutes had passed, that liquid changed color to bright red. At this, even I was somewhat surprised, but if I think scientifically, since that liquid is acidic, I think it caused some chemical change with some component of that medicine.
If someone who knows nothing saw this, they might think the God's grace is manifest, and might feel unnecessarily awe-struck.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

To speak of such things would not only be an affront to a lady but a grievous insult. Moreover, I run the risk of being branded a madman or a fool. The shame I feel is, if anything, even greater than hers would be.
Alternatively, I could sneak to the back of her outdoor toilet at night, wait for her to arrive, and reach my hand through the waste-collection hatch to catch it in a vessel. But that hardly seems the sort of thing a gentleman ought to do.
Once again, I found myself utterly at a loss. Yet the situation was desperate.
There wasn't a moment to lose.
—"Damn it all," I thought. "Why not just meet her and lay bare the whole truth? Surely she wouldn't refuse then. And being a woman of character, she would be too embarrassed to breathe a word of it to her parents or anyone else. It's now or never—sink or swim!"
I finally made my choice, casting aside every shred of pride and shame.
It seems a man is capable of anything when cornered. Though I have never been particularly bold, once my mind was made up, I was possessed by a frantic restlessness.
The sluggish crawl of the city tram became unbearable; I stood there, stamping my feet in a fever of impatience. The image of Karida’s face, bright with joy at his recovery, flickered before my eyes and refused to vanish.

IV.
"It is for these reasons that I beg of you. I ask you to do this to save a friend's life. I am a man who understands shame; I cannot tell you how many times I hesitated before coming to you with such a request. But right now, my mind is consumed by my friend’s plight. Please, I implore you!"
To an onlooker, my desperate pleading—bowing and scraping as if in prayer—might have seemed utterly farcical. But for me, it was a moment of pure, agonizing tragedy.
Cold sweat poured from my brow and soaked my armpits. My clenched fists were slick with it. Throughout my plea, she sat perfectly still, her beautiful eyebrows never once flickering as she listened. At last, her lovely lips, pink as cherry shells, parted slowly.
"So... um... did you happen to bring a container with you?"
Miss Sumako spoke in a tiny voice, her cheeks flushing a deep, embarrassed crimson.
Internally, I had been trembling as I watched for her reaction, but hearing this, I knew I had won. Success was certain.
"Yes... yes, I have it right here!"
My voice shook with relief and joy. I reached into my pocket, produced a paper-wrapped vessel, and placed it gently before her.
She took it and said, "Please wait here a moment," then rose and quietly slipped from the room.

I struck a match and lit a cigarette, the tension finally breaking.
After a short while, she returned, carrying the paper-wrapped container.
As I took it from her with trembling hands, I could still feel a faint, lingering warmth through the paper and the glass.
As I prepared to leave, Miss Sumako whispered, "You must promise never to tell a soul about this."
"Of course," I replied.
I thanked her profusely, over and over again, before taking my leave.
Upon returning home, I spent a moment gazing at the clear liquid that had come from Sumako’s beautiful body. Then, I set the vessel upon an electric heater, took the 'precious medicine' (?) I had gotten from Karida, and stirred it in.
Soon, the liquid began to steam and bubble. After about thirty minutes, the fluid turned a startling, vivid red. Even I was taken aback, though scientifically speaking, I suppose the acidity of the liquid must have triggered a chemical reaction with the medicine.
To an uneducated observer, this transformation might have looked like a divine miracle, and they would likely have been overcome with superstitious awe.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** Standard vertical-aligned Japanese text (tategaki) read from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of Kanji and Hiragana with traditional orthography (Historical Kana usage). The Kanji used are Kyūjitai (old forms), such as "對" for "対", "爲" for "為", and "孃" for "嬢".
*   **Structure:** This is part 4 of a serialized story, as indicated by the "四、" (Four) marker.
*   **Illustration:** A line-art illustration occupies the bottom right, depicting a man (presumably the protagonist) in a state of mental anguish or deep thought, holding his head. The signature "三郎" (Saburō) is visible.
*   **Page Number:** "—58—" is printed at the bottom right corner, suggesting this is a page from a literary magazine or a cheap "pulp" paperback (Bunkobon).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The dialogue is indented or marked with traditional Japanese brackets 「 」. The narrative flow is dense with small margins.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s to early 1950s. The presence of an "electric heater" (電熱器) and the "city tram" (市電) places it in a modern urban setting, while the orthography suggests the transition period before the 1946 script reforms were fully adopted in popular magazines.
*   **Folk Medicine & Urine Therapy:** The plot involves "urine therapy" or the use of human excretions as a base for medicine. In Japanese folk belief and some pseudo-scientific circles of the era, the urine of a "young, pure woman" was sometimes thought to have medicinal or even magical properties. 
*   **Social Class:** The protagonist refers to himself as a "gentleman" (紳士) and Sumako as a "lady" (淑女) or "Miss" (嬢 - used for unmarried daughters of good families). The extreme shame associated with the request highlights the strict social decorum regarding bodily functions and gender interactions.
*   **Ero-Guro:** The focus on bodily fluids (urine), the sneaking around toilets, and the fetishistic description of the woman’s "beautiful body" producing "transparent liquid" are hallmarks of the *Ero-Guro Nansensu* (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense) literary movement that flourished in the Shōwa era.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **淑女 (Shukujo):** A lady; a woman of high social standing and refined manners.
*   **汲取口 (Kumitori-guchi):** The hatch at the back of a vault toilet used by "honey bucket" collectors. Mentioning this adds a "grotesque" or "filthy" realism to the narrative.
*   **猶予 (Yūyo):** Delay or postponement. Often used in the context of "no time to lose."
*   **平身低頭 (Heishin Teitō):** Prostrating oneself; bowing very low as a sign of deep apology or humble request.
*   **桜貝 (Sakuragai):** Nitidella (a type of seashell). A poetic trope used to describe delicate, pink fingernails or lips.
*   **高貴薬 (Kōkigaku):** "Noble medicine" or "precious medicine." These were often expensive, traditional medicines (like ginseng or animal-based concoctions) used in desperate health situations.
*   **あらたか (Arataka):** (Of a god's grace or a medicine's effect) miraculous, manifest, or potent.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Desperation vs. Dignity:** The protagonist struggles between his identity as a "gentleman" and the "shameful" acts he must perform to save his friend.
*   **The Fetishization of the "Pure":** The story contrasts the "shameful" nature of the waste with the "beauty" and "purity" of the woman providing it. The liquid is described as "transparent" and coming from a "beautiful body," elevating a biological waste product to something sacred or medicinal.
*   **Science vs. Superstition:** The protagonist tries to rationalize the chemical change (turning red) with "science" (acidity), but acknowledges that a layperson would see it as a "miracle" (御利益). This reflects the era's tension between traditional beliefs and the encroaching modern scientific worldview.
*   **Gender Roles:** The female character, Sumako, is portrayed as passive and compliant yet deeply embarrassed, fulfilling a specific trope of the "virtuous but helpful maiden."
