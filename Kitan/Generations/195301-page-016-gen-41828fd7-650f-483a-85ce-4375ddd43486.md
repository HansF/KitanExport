**[Boxed Text: Author's Words]**
In the world, "Abnist" ecology-describing novels and confession records after the war flooded, but among them, things that touched the truth feel extremely few. Because publishing one's own shameful acts requires great courage, people refrain, and I think many become the delusions of lecherous hack writers. I have six "Abnist" sexual friends; this story's protagonist is a currently existing person, but this time, having obtained the person's consent, I tried writing a true confession record on the person's behalf. If this confession record becomes a "stone from another mountain" [lesson] for the wise readers, I am happy. (Born Oniyama)

My father was a person who in one generation made a fortune, a so-called "success story" person, a great man, but why I, the son who shares that blood, was born with such a spineless character, I sometimes utterly feel miserable. When I was eight years old, my mother died, and the current mother, bringing my younger brother, came to the house. The mother was Father's No. 2 [mistress] but was promoted to No. 1. The previous mother, just before death, called me to her bedside and saying, "Whatever the mother who comes next says, listen with 'Yes, Yes'," she left [the words] and passed away. The current mother was a former Yanagibashi geisha, but she was a very well-made [capable] person, and with Father, they seemed well-joined. Mother's attitude toward me was totally un[fair]...

**[Boxed Text: A Note from the Author]**
Since the end of the war, the world has been flooded with novels and "confessions" depicting the lives of "Abnists." Yet, it seems to me that very few of these actually touch upon the truth. Because it requires immense courage to go public with one's own shameful acts, people tend to hold back; consequently, most of these works are nothing more than the fantasies of erotic hack writers. I have six friends of the "Abnist" variety. Though the protagonist of this piece is a real person, I have received his consent to ghostwrite this authentic confession on his behalf. I would be gratified if this account serves as a cautionary tale for my esteemed readers. — Kensaku Oniyama

My father was a remarkable man—a self-made success of the sort one reads about in biographies. Yet, when I consider how I, his own flesh and blood, turned out to be such a spineless and pathetic character, I am often overcome with a deep sense of wretchedness. 
When I was eight, my mother passed away, and my current mother arrived at our home, bringing my younger brother with her. She had been my father’s "Number Two"—his mistress—but was then "promoted" to Number One. Just before she died, my first mother called me to her bedside. "No matter what your new mother says," she told me, "you must obey her without question." With those final words, she passed away.
My current mother was formerly a geisha from the Yanagibashi district. She was an exceptionally capable woman and seemed to share a deep bond with my father. Her attitude toward me, however, was entirely un[predictable]...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a traditional vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). The title and author name are prominently displayed on the right side, framed by a decorative wavy border.
*   **Typography:** The title "らぶ・すれいぶ" (Love Slave) uses a bold, rounded font. The author's name, 鬼山 絢策 (Oniyama Kensaku), is in a standard Gothic/Mincho style.
*   **The "Author's Note" Box:** A boxed section at the top left provides meta-commentary, a common trope in "confessional" pulp fiction to lend an air of authenticity or "educational" value to erotic content.
*   **Illustration:** A line-art illustration occupies the bottom right. It depicts a woman in a swimsuit (bikini) lounging on a float or beach chair, while a man lies below her, looking up in a submissive or admiring posture. This visually reinforces the "Love Slave" theme and the power dynamic described in the text.
*   **Page Numbering:** "22" is printed in the top right corner in Western numerals.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture (1945–1950s):** The term *Kasutori* refers to cheap, low-quality sake, and by extension, the low-budget, sensationalist magazines that proliferated in Japan after WWII. These magazines focused on "Ero-Guro-Nonsense" (Eroticism, Grotesquerie, and the Nonsensical).
*   **"Abnist" (アブニスト):** A pseudo-scientific or slang term derived from "Abnormal" (abunōmaru) + "-ist." In this era, it specifically referred to people with "perverted" or non-normative sexual fetishes (S&M, fetishism, etc.).
*   **Yanagibashi (柳橋):** A prestigious geisha district in Tokyo. Mentioning that the new mother was a Yanagibashi geisha implies she was sophisticated, beautiful, and socially adept, but also hints at her origins in the "willow and flower world," contrasting with the "proper" first wife.
*   **Mistress Culture (*Nigo*):** In pre-war and early post-war Japan, it was relatively common for wealthy or powerful men to maintain "No. 2" (*nigo*) or "No. 3" (*sango*) mistresses. The promotion of a mistress to the legal wife after the death of the first wife was a significant (and often scandalous) family event.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **不甲斐ない (Fugainai):** Spineless, cowardly, or pathetic. It reflects the narrator's self-loathing and perhaps his submissive sexual nature.
*   **立志伝中の人物 (Risshiden-chū no jinbutsu):** A person who is a "self-made success." Usually used for people who rose from poverty to great wealth/status.
*   **他山の石 (Tazan no ishi):** Literally "a stone from another mountain." An idiom meaning "an example from which one can learn," or "a cautionary tale."
*   **売文家 (Baibun-ka):** A "hack writer" or "pen-for-hire." Used here pejoratively to distinguish the author from those who write purely for money/titillation.
*   **性友 (Seiyū):** A "sexual friend" or "companion in fetish." A specific term used in the context of shared sexual interests.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Masochism and Submission:** The title "Love Slave" and the narrator's description of his "spineless" character suggest a story centered on male sexual submissiveness. The mother's deathbed command to "obey the new mother no matter what" provides a psychological justification (or "trauma") for this submissiveness.
*   **Class and Masculinity:** There is a stark contrast between the "Great Man" father (active, successful, dominant) and the "Pathetic" son (passive, submissive). This reflects a common post-war literary theme of the "failed" or "emasculated" Japanese male.
*   **Authenticity vs. Fiction:** The author's note goes to great lengths to claim the story is "true" and "based on a real person." This was a standard rhetorical strategy in pulp magazines to bypass censorship and entice readers with "real" scandals.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
