**女風土記**
**初　一　念**
**風流太郎**

女は男の女房になるつもりで居た。
別に明瞭と男と約束を交した譯でもなく、男も、日頃の交遊の戲れ言にさえも、その様な行く末の雷同になるような喜ばせは、露さら匂わせたこともないのだが、女は男の女房になれるつもりで居た。
女は男をまるで秘蔵の宝石でも労わるように、心の底から愛撫した。まるで世話女房のような、痒いところに手の届く、愛情の構図であつた。
✕　　　✕
男も女が好きだつた。まともに受けるには面映ゆい程な女の細やかな愛情を、男はこよなく心嬉しく想つて居るのだが、その癖、表面では大して嬉しいような顔も見せず、まるで、借金の返済でも受取るような、至極のほほんとした顔で、それでもせつせと女の許に通つて居た。
✕　　　✕
男が女房を貰つた。
だが、どうした事か、男の女房はその女ではなかつた。女は暫らくの間は、掌中の珠でも奪はれた様にしよんぼりして居たが、思い切りよく諦めたものか、間もなく元気を取り戻した。
女の、ほのかなる期待を無惨に裏切つて、他の女と結婚した男は、それでも、別に済まなそうな顔も見せず、結婚後も時折女の許に訪づれては、女の細い、その肉付のいい指を、子供が玩具でも弄ぶように愛撫しながら女の圓い膝枕に身勝手な饗の夢を見て居た。
女はそんな儚ない逢瀬をさえ、心から喜んで、此の薄情男に昔に変らない細やかな愛情を、降る星の如く注いで居た。
✕　　　✕
男の結婚生活は長く続かなかつた。男の女房はかりそめの風邪が因で、あつけなく死んで仕舞つた。
男は、其の後も降るような再婚話には耳も借さず、その癖、またぞろせつせと女の愛情の門を叩いて無作法な仮寝の夢を食ばつて居た。

一年は経つた。
男は、二度目の女房を貰つた。今度も、どうした事か、男の女房はその女ではなかつた。女はちよつと当が外れたような顔をしたが、それでも、其の後男に逢つても未練がましい愚痴ひとつ口に出さず、矢ツ張り其れからも時折通つて来る男を昔に変らず、綿網のやうなきめの細かい愛情で包んで居た。
✕　　　✕
男の二度目の結婚も、不幸にして長く続かなかつた。二度目の女房と円満に別れた男は、うるさく舞い込む再婚話を何処吹く風ときき流して、又ぞろ、せつせと女の許に通い出した。男の足はだんだん繁くなり、此の頃では殆んど入りびたりのような状態であつた。女は相変らず、世話女房のような至れり盡せりの愛情を男に注いで居た。二度目の女房と別れれてからもう一年余り過ぎた。もう誰も、男に再婚話を持つて来なくなつた。誰でもが当然の結末のようにその女と男との生活を、温い友情の鏡つた眼眸で眺めて居た。
それでも、男は女を女房にしようとは言わなかつた。女も、男に、女房にして呉れとは言わなかつた。然し、女はまた男の女房になるつもりで居た。否、或はもう女は男の女房になつたつもりで、居るのかもしれなかつた。
其の後ずつと、至極平穏無事に、幸福そうな男と女の愛情生活が波瀾もなく続いて居るところを見ると、どうやら女は初一念を貫いたようである。それにしては随分と手間のかかつた男と女の愛の歸決ではあつた。
ーおわりー

**男と女の交情は山峡の泉のようなものであつた。絶えようとして絶えず切れようとして切れず、今に至るまで綿々と續いてゐるのであつた。**

**Woman’s Local Chronicle**
**Initial Resolution**
**By Furyu Taro**

The woman was intending to become the man's wife.
It wasn't that she had exchanged a clear promise with the man, and the man, even in the jokes of their daily social interaction, had never even hinted at a future agreement to please her, but the woman intended to be able to become the man's wife.
The woman caressed the man from the bottom of her heart, as if caring for a treasured jewel. It was a composition of affection, like a devoted wife, reaching every itchy spot.
✕　　　✕
The man also liked the woman. Although the man felt extremely happy in his heart about the woman's delicate affection, which was almost embarrassing to receive directly, he had a habit of not showing a very happy face on the surface; with a completely nonchalant face, as if receiving a debt repayment, he nevertheless diligently visited the woman's place.
✕　　　✕
The man took a wife.
But, for some reason, the man's wife was not that woman. For a while, the woman was dejected as if a jewel in her palm had been snatched away, but perhaps having given up with good grace, she soon regained her spirits.
The man, who had cruelly betrayed the woman’s faint expectations and married another woman, still did not show a particularly sorry face; even after marriage, he occasionally visited the woman, and while caressing her thin, well-fleshed fingers like a child playing with a toy, he saw selfish dreams of banquets on her round lap-pillow.
The woman rejoiced from her heart even at such fleeting trysts, and poured onto this heartless man a delicate affection unchanged from the old days, like falling stars.
✕　　　✕
The man's married life did not last long. The man's wife died abruptly due to a slight cold.
The man, after that, did not lend an ear to the rain-like talk of remarriage, but habitually and diligently knocked on the gate of the woman's affection, devouring the dreams of ill-mannered naps.

One year passed.
The man took a second wife. This time too, for some reason, the man's wife was not that woman. The woman made a face as if her expectations were slightly missed, but even so, even when meeting the man after that, she did not utter a single lingering complaint, and as expected, she wrapped the man who occasionally visited from then on in a fine-textured affection like silk wadding, unchanged from the old days.
✕　　　✕
The man's second marriage, unfortunately, also did not last long. The man, who parted amicably from his second wife, ignored the noisily incoming talk of remarriage like wind blowing past his ears, and habitually and diligently began to visit the woman's place. The man's visits became gradually frequent, and around this time, it was almost a state of being always there. The woman, as usual, poured a thorough affection like a devoted wife onto the man. More than a year had passed since he parted with his second wife. No one brought talk of remarriage to the man anymore. Everyone, as if it were a natural conclusion, watched the life of that woman and man with eyes full of warm friendship.
Even so, the man did not say he would make the woman his wife. The woman also did not say to the man, "Please make me your wife." However, the woman intended again to become the man's wife. No, or perhaps the woman might have been under the intention that she had already become the man's wife.
Since then, seeing that the seemingly happy love-life of the man and woman has continued without upheaval, extremely peacefully and safely, it seems the woman has somehow carried out her initial resolution. Even so, it was a conclusion of the love of a man and woman that took quite a lot of effort.
—The End—

**The affection of the man and woman was like a spring in a mountain ravine. Trying to cease but not ceasing, trying to break but not breaking, it has continued incessantly until now.**

**A Woman’s Chronicle: The Original Vow**
**By Furyu Taro**

The woman lived with the quiet conviction that she would one day be his wife. There had been no formal promise between them, nor had the man ever hinted at such a future even in the playful banter of their daily lives. Yet, she remained certain. She cherished him from the depths of her soul, as though he were a rare and precious jewel. Her devotion was total—the kind of meticulous, intuitive care one expects from a dedicated wife who anticipates every unspoken need.

✕　　　✕

The man, for his part, was fond of her. While her delicate, almost overwhelming affection filled him with a secret joy, he never allowed it to show. He wore a mask of nonchalance, accepting her kindness with the flat indifference of a man collecting on a debt. And yet, he never failed to visit her.

✕　　　✕

Eventually, the man took a wife. But she was not that woman. For a time, the woman was crestfallen, as if a treasure had been snatched from her very palm. But she was resilient; she soon regained her composure, perhaps having resigned herself to her fate. 

Despite having callously ignored her quiet hopes to marry another, the man showed no remorse. Even after his wedding, he continued to visit her. He would toy with her slender, supple fingers like a child with a plaything, and fall into selfish, indulgent daydreams while resting his head upon her lap. The woman took a genuine, simple joy even in these fleeting encounters, showering this heartless man with an affection as constant and shimmering as a sky full of falling stars.

✕　　　✕

The man’s marriage was brief. His wife died suddenly from a mere cold. Though proposals for a second marriage rained down upon him afterward, he turned a deaf ear to them all. Instead, he returned to the woman, knocking once more at the gates of her heart to indulge in his familiar, ill-mannered repose.

A year passed.

The man took a second wife. Once again, it was not her. The woman looked momentarily disappointed, yet she never uttered a single word of complaint or bitterness. When he visited her, she wrapped him in the same fine-spun, silken affection she always had.

✕　　　✕

This second marriage also ended in failure. After an amicable divorce, the man ignored the renewed clamor for him to remarry. He began to visit the woman with increasing frequency until he was practically living at her side. She, in turn, remained the picture of the devoted spouse, attending to his every need. 

More than a year has passed since his second divorce. No one brings him marriage proposals anymore. The neighbors and friends now watch the couple with a warm, knowing kindness, as if their union were the only natural conclusion.

The man has still never asked her to be his wife. The woman has never asked him to take her as his own. Yet, she remains steadfast in her intent—or perhaps, in her own mind, she is his wife already. Their life together continues in peaceful, unremarkable happiness. It seems she has finally fulfilled her original vow, though it was a long and winding road to reach such a destination.

—The End—

**The bond between them was like a spring hidden in a mountain gorge. It ebbed but never failed; it frayed but never broke. To this very day, it flows on, unceasing and eternal.**

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Format and Layout
*   **Publication Style:** This appears to be a page from a literary or "middle-brow" (inter-war or early post-war) magazine. The paper is aged, and the typesetting is traditional vertical Japanese (tategaki).
*   **Column Structure:** The main story is organized into three vertical columns.
*   **Visual Elements:** 
    *   **Title/Author Box:** Located in the top center, framed with a decorative border.
    *   **Dividers:** Large "✕" marks are used to denote scene breaks or time skips.
    *   **Summary/Epigraph:** A bolded text block on the far left acts as a thematic summary or a "blurb" to catch the reader's attention.
    *   **Illustration:** A simple line drawing (chojugiga-adjacent or heta-uma style) at the bottom shows a woman in a kimono, reinforcing the domestic/feminine theme.
*   **Typography:** The use of *kyu-kanji* (e.g., 續, 譯, 圓, 歸) and *kyu-kana* (e.g., 居た, ゐる, 奪はれた) places the text likely in the late 1940s or early 1950s, shortly before the full standardization of modern Japanese orthography.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### The "Me-me-shii" Man and the Devoted Woman
The story portrays a dynamic common in 20th-century Japanese "Ai-yoku" (love and desire) literature: the selfish, indecisive man and the "enduring" woman (*shinobu onna*). The man marries twice for social or practical reasons, while the woman remains a "shadow wife," eventually winning out through sheer persistence rather than legal status.

### Fudoki (風土記)
The title "Onna Fudoki" (Woman's Local Chronicle) is a play on the ancient *Fudoki*—reports commissioned in the 8th century to describe the history, geography, and folklore of various provinces. Using this title for a series of short stories implies a "topography of the female heart" or a survey of different types of women's lives.

### Post-War Sentiment
The casual mention of the first wife dying of a "mere cold" (かりそめの風邪) might reflect the precarious health conditions of the immediate post-war era (late 1940s) before antibiotics and better nutrition became widespread. 

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **初一念 (Sho-ichinen):** One's original intention or first resolution. It implies a vow made at the start that is kept until the end.
*   **世話女房 (Sewa-nyobo):** A wife who takes great care of her husband, often in a maternal or domestic sense.
*   **掌中の珠 (Shochu no tama):** Literally "a jewel in the palm." A metaphor for something extremely precious or a beloved child/partner.
*   **膝枕 (Hizamakura):** Lap-pillow. A classic trope in Japanese romance signifying intimacy and comfort.
*   **綿々 (Men-men):** Continuous, unceasing, or lingering (like a long thread of cotton).
*   **露さら (Tsuyu-sara):** (Usually followed by a negative) Not at all; not even a bit.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

### Resilience through Passivity
The protagonist does not fight the other wives or demand the man choose her. Her "victory" comes from her ability to outlast his legal marriages. This reflects a traditional gender ideal where a woman’s strength is found in her endurance (*gaman*) and emotional constancy.

### De Facto vs. De Jure
The story suggests that a "real" marriage is defined by the "composition of affection" (愛情の構図) and the "spring-like" flow of emotion, rather than a legal document. By the end, the community views them as a couple, rendering the formal title of "wife" almost unnecessary.

### The Selfishness of Men
The man is described as "thin-skinned" or "heartless" (*busho*), treating the woman's love as "debt repayment." There is a subtle critique of male entitlement in the era—he expects her to be there whenever his "official" life fails.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story (Tanpen), Literary Sketch.
*   **Genre:** Romance, Domestic Drama, *Watakushi-shōsetsu* style (I-novel style).
