海の女狼
怪機帆船
神山榮三

「明石海峡に海賊船が出ると言う話だぜ」
海を見晴らす事の出来る突堤の際に建つている兵庫機械汽船會社の事務室ではこんな話に花が咲いていた。
「ホウ面白いぢやないか、街にはビス組、海にはゲリラ船か、世の中も賑やかになつて来るの」
「ゲリラ船？」
「そうぢやないか眞昼間堂々と、かゝられない奴さ―」
「恐ろしい奴だつて言うぢやないか」
「何にが恐ろしいかい、たかゞ知れた小賊ではないか」
「清吉、大きな事をほざくな幽霊船が出て来ると、こう言うふいに身体を震わさないようにな……」
「何だと親爺、それ位のコツボ泥に恐れて船長が勤まるつて言うのかい」
「何にッ。清吉もう一度言つて見ろ―」
「理屈ばかりうまくなりやがつて」
「そうぢやねえか、三十年海で鍛えた。眞銅造り、その鐵の身体であつたら怖くはあるめい」
「だれが怖いと言つた」
「そう言う、口の下から煙草の煙がふるえているぜ……」
「何んだとッ、此の野郎！」
「まあ、まあ船長！」
「清吉もいい加減にへらつ口を叩くのはやめろ」
こう言つて事務員がとゞめるのであつた。
「船長、今度の積荷は綿布ばかりですからしっかり頼みますよ」
「わかつてるよ」
「危いですからね積荷は晝間より夕方暗くなつてからのがいいと思います」
「夜だと」
「さうです、幽霊積んだ、平和丸も天洋丸も吉田丸もやられていますから夜間だとわからないと、思いますが」
「見ているものがあるのかい」
「それはわかりませんが、奴等が待つている處を見ると情報がわかるのでしょう」
「そんな馬鹿な事があるもんか」
船長は噛んだものを吐き出すように言つた。
「スパイは何處にでもおりますからね」
「何だと」
「諜報網は悪い事をする奴の方が先手をつと言う事ですよ」
「清吉」
「ヘイ」
「貴様、歸還してからツベコベと反抗ばかりするが、何が頼んだ」
「頼だだつて、船長、俺れは、この清吉は心から船長が可愛いから、いや好きだから言うのさ、嫌だつたら誰れが言うものかい」
こう言つて機動部隊の海の豹だと恐れられていた清吉はムンズと口をへの字にまげてしまつた。
「出て行け、貴様の顔を見るのも嫌にさわあお出て行け」
「清吉がいなくなつて船が動かないと言つて泣きなさんな」
「エンジンなら俺の方がもつと詳細しいわ、この馬鹿野郎……」
清吉と船長との口論は何時もの事であつた。夫婦が喧嘩の様に、おつ始めてもすぐ仲がよくなるのであつたが、だから今宵もそうだろうと思っていたが、どうも雲行きが、變になつて来た。
「俺れあ、岡へあがるよ」
「あがれ、そのかわり、轍の鮒のように水がなくなるとピチピチするなよ」
「船長」
「何だ」
「幽霊船が現れて震いあがらないで下さいよ。強奪されると會社に迷惑がかゝりますから御注意しときます」
「勝手にしろ」
「勝手にします。今晩はパンパンで、も抱いて久しぶりに色酒と行こうか」
清吉は機關士の帽子を握つたまま事務室を出ようとした。
「清吉君、腹も立とうが、この仕事をすましてからにしてくれ」
丁度來合せた社長が傍から聲をかけた。
「御断り致します」
「清吉、まさか本氣ぢあ、あるめい」
「冗談だろう、清吉」
清吉そう怒つて仕方あるまい」
色々と、なだめたが一本気な清吉はだまつて外へ出ていつた清吉がいな、い船は魂がぬけた様なものだつた。船長も年だ、船長の後をつぐものは清吉よりあかりやしない。その清吉が下船するとなると誰れがエンジンを修理するのだ、よく怒るエンジンを抱えて一同は呆然してしまつたのだつた。
「船長、大丈夫かね」
社長は心配そうに聲をかけた。
「社長、御安心下さい三十年海で鍛えた私でさあ！」

「明石海峡に海賊船が出ると言う話だぜ」
海を見晴らすことの出来る突堤の際に建っている兵庫機械汽船会社の事務室では、こんな話に花が咲いていた。
「ホウ、面白いじゃないか。街にはビス組、海にはゲリラ船か。世の中も賑やかになって来るの」
「ゲリラ船？」
「そうじゃないか。真っ昼間、堂々と、かかられない奴さ――」
「恐ろしい奴だって言うじゃないか」
「何が恐ろしいかい、たかが知れた小賊ではないか」
「清吉、大きな事をほざくな。幽霊船が出て来ると、こう言うふうに身体を震わせないようにな……」
「何だと親父、それ位の小粒泥棒に恐れて船長が勤まるって言うのかい」
「何にッ。清吉、もう一度言ってみろ――」
「理屈ばかりうまくなりやがって」
「そうじゃねえか、三十年海で鍛えた。真銅造り、その鉄の身体であったら怖くはあるめい」
「誰が怖いと言った」
「そう言う、口の下から煙草の煙が震えているぜ……」
「何だとッ、この野郎！」
「まあ、まあ船長！」
「清吉もいい加減に減らず口を叩くのはやめろ」
こう言って事務員が留めるのであった。
「船長、今度の積荷は綿布ばかりですから、しっかり頼みますよ」
「わかってるよ」
「危ないですからね。積荷は昼間より夕方、暗くなってからの方がいいと思います」
「夜だと」
「そうです。幽霊（船に）積んだ、平和丸も天洋丸も吉田丸もやられていますから。夜間だとわからないと思いますが」
「見ている者がいるのかい」
「それはわかりませんが、奴らが待っている所を見ると情報が漏れているのでしょう」
「そんな馬鹿なことがあるもんか」
船長は噛んだものを吐き出すように言った。
「スパイはどこにでもおりますからね」

「頼んだだって、船長、俺は、この清吉は心から船長が可愛いから、いや好きだから言うのさ。嫌だったら誰が言うものかい」
こう言って、機動部隊の「海の豹」だと恐れられていた清吉は、ムンズと口を「への字」に曲げてしまった。
「出て行け、貴様の顔を見るのも嫌になった、さあ出て行け」
「清吉がいなくなって船が動かないと言って泣きなさんな」
「エンジンなら俺の方がもっと詳しいわ、この馬鹿野郎……」
清吉と船長との口論はいつもの事であった。夫婦喧嘩のように始めてもすぐ仲良くなるのであったが、今宵もそうだろうと思っていたところ、どうも雲行きが怪しくなってきた。
「俺は、岡へ上がるよ」
「上がれ。その代わり、轍（わだち）の鮒のように、水がなくなるとピチピチするなよ」
「船長」
「何だ」
「幽霊船が現れて震え上がらないで下さいよ。強奪されると会社に迷惑がかかりますから御注意しときます」

ちょうど居合わせた社長が傍から声をかけた。
「お断り致します」
「清吉、まさか本気じゃあるまい」
「冗談だろう、清吉」
「清吉、そう怒っても仕方あるまい」
色々と、なだめたが一本気な清吉は黙って外へ出て行った。清吉のいない船は魂が抜けたようなものだった。船長も年だ。船長の後を継ぐ者は清吉より他にいやしない。その清吉が下船するとなると、誰がエンジンを修理するのだ。よく怒る（機嫌の悪い）エンジンを抱えて、一同は呆然としてしまったのだった。
「船長、大丈夫かね」
社長は心配そうに声をかけた。
「社長、ご安心下さい。三十年海で鍛えた私でさあ！」
「だが、年齢には勝てんからね」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Sea Vixen: Mysterious Motor-Sailing Ship**
**By Eizo Kamiyama**

"They say pirate ships appear in the Akashi Strait."
In the office of the Hyogo Kikai Steamship Company, which stands at the edge of a jetty overlooking the sea, such talk was in full bloom.
"Hoh, isn't that interesting. In the city there are 'bis-gangs,' and on the sea there are 'guerrilla ships'? The world is becoming lively."
"Guerrilla ships?"
"Isn't that right? In broad daylight, boldly, those who cannot be caught—"
"They say they are terrifying fellows."
"What is terrifying? Are they not just small-time crooks whose worth is easily known?"
"Kiyokichi, do not spout big words. Lest, when a ghost ship appears, you make your body tremble in this way..."
"What was that, old man? Are you saying a captain can serve while fearing a small-time thief of that level?"
"What! Kiyokichi, say that once more—"
"You've only gotten good at logic-chopping."
"Isn't it so? For thirty years hardened by the sea. If you have a body made of bronze and iron, you wouldn't be afraid."
"Who said they were afraid!"
"You say so, but from below your mouth, the cigarette smoke is trembling..."
"What! You bastard!"
"Now, now, Captain!"
"Kiyokichi, stop talking back so much."
Thus the clerk tried to stop them.
"Captain, since this cargo is all cotton cloth, please handle it reliably."
"I know."
"It is dangerous, so regarding the cargo, I think it is better to go after it gets dark in the evening than during the day."
"At night?"
"Yes. Because the Heiwa-maru, the Tenyo-maru, and the Yoshida-maru, which loaded 'ghosts,' were all hit; I think it is because they don't know [where they are] if it is nighttime."
"Is there someone watching?"
"That I do not know, but seeing how they are waiting, they must know the information."
"How can there be such a stupid thing!"
The captain said as if spitting out what he was chewing.
"Spies are everywhere, you know."
"What?"
"It means the network of intelligence of those who do bad things makes the first move."
"Kiyokichi."
"Hey."
"You, ever since you returned [from the war], you do nothing but mutter and rebel, but what did I ask of you?"
"Even if you ask, Captain, I—this Kiyokichi—say this because from my heart I find the Captain cute, no, because I like him. If I hated you, who would say such things?"
Saying this, Kiyokichi, who was feared as the "Leopard of the Sea" in the Task Force, clamped his mouth shut in the shape of the character 'he' (へ).
"Get out! I have become sick of looking at your face. Now, get out!"
"Don't cry later saying the ship won't move because Kiyokichi is gone."
"If it's the engine, I am more detailed-oriented [knowledgeable]! You idiot..."
The argument between Kiyokichi and the captain was a regular occurrence. Even if they started like a married couple's quarrel, they would soon become close again, and everyone thought it would be the same tonight, but the movement of the clouds [the situation] became strange.
"I am going up to the land [quitting]."
"Go up then. In exchange, don't go twitching like a carp in a rut when the water disappears."
"Captain."
"What."
"Please don't tremble when the ghost ship appears. I'm warning you because if it's plundered, it will cause trouble for the company."
"Do as you please!"
"I will do as I please. Tonight, I'll go hold a 'pan-pan' girl and drink cheap sake for the first time in a while."
Kiyokichi, holding his engineer's cap, tried to leave the office.
"Kiyokichi-kun, you must be angry, but please do this job first."
The President, who happened to be present, called out from the side.
"I refuse."
"Kiyokichi, surely you aren't serious."
"It's a joke, right, Kiyokichi?"
"Kiyokichi, there's no use being that angry."
They soothed him in various ways, but the single-minded Kiyokichi went outside in silence. A ship without Kiyokichi was like a thing whose soul had been pulled out. The captain was old, too. There was no one to succeed the captain except Kiyokichi. If that Kiyokichi were to leave the ship, who would repair the engine? Carrying the burden of a frequent-tempered engine, everyone was left stunned.
"Captain, will it be alright?"
The President called out worriedly.
"President, please be at ease. It's me, hardened by thirty years at sea!"
"But, you can't beat age, can you?"
Because there was such a misunderstanding, the cargo...

**The Sea Vixen: The Phantom Motor-Sailing Ship**
**By Eizo Kamiyama**

"Word is, there's a pirate ship prowling the Akashi Strait."
The rumor was in full flower inside the office of the Hyogo Machinery & Steamship Company, a building perched on the edge of a jetty with a sweeping view of the sea.
"Ha! Isn't that something. We've got the 'Bis-Gangs' in the city and 'guerrilla ships' on the water. The world’s certainly getting lively, isn't it?"
"Guerrilla ships?"
"That's right. The kind that operate boldly in broad daylight and can't be caught—"
"They say they’re a terrifying lot."
"Terrifying? What’s so terrifying about them? They're nothing more than petty thieves."
"Kiyokichi, don't talk so big. Try not to let your knees knock like that when the phantom ship actually shows up..."
"What was that, old man? Are you telling me you can cut it as a captain while you're shaking in your boots over a few small-time crooks?"
"What! Kiyokichi, say that again—!"
"You've certainly developed a silver tongue, haven't you?"
"And why shouldn't I? I’ve been forged by thirty years at sea. If you had a body of bronze and iron like mine, you wouldn't know the meaning of fear."
"Who said anything about being afraid?"
"You say that, but the cigarette smoke trailing from your lip is shaking like a leaf..."
"Why, you little—!"
"Now, now, Captain!"
"Kiyokichi, that's enough of your backtalk!"
An office clerk stepped in to de-escalate the situation. 
"Captain, this next shipment is nothing but cotton cloth. We’re counting on you."
"I know, I know."
"It's dangerous out there. I think it would be better to move the cargo after dusk rather than during the day."
"At night?"
"Yes. The *Heiwa-maru*, the *Tenyo-maru*, and the *Yoshida-maru*—all of them carrying 'ghost' shipments—were hit. I suspect they wouldn't be able to spot us under the cover of night."
"You think someone is watching us?"
"I can't say for sure, but the way they lie in wait suggests they’ve got inside information."
"Don't be ridiculous," the captain spat, as if discarding a bitter taste from his mouth.
"Spies are everywhere these days."
"What?"
"It just means that the criminal underworld's intelligence network always manages to stay one step ahead."
"Kiyokichi!"
"Yeah?"
"You've done nothing but bark and rebel since you got back from the front. Who do you think you're talking to?"
"Captain, I only say these things because I actually care about you—hell, because I like you. If I didn't give a damn, I wouldn't waste my breath."
With that, Kiyokichi—once feared as the "Leopard of the Sea" during his time in the Task Force—set his mouth into a grim, stubborn line.
"Get out! I'm sick of the sight of you. Get out now!"
"Don't come crying to me when the ship won't budge because I'm gone."
"I know ten times more about engines than you ever will, you idiot!"
Arguments between Kiyokichi and the captain were as common as a married couple's bickering, usually followed by a quick reconciliation. Everyone expected the same tonight, but the atmosphere turned unexpectedly dark.
"Fine. I’m going ashore for good."
"Then go! Just don't come flopping around like a fish in a dry rut when you realize you've got no place to go."
"Captain."
"What now?"
"Just try not to soil yourself when that phantom ship appears. I'm only warning you because the company will be in a fix if we're robbed."
"Go to hell!"
"Gladly. Maybe tonight I'll find myself a 'pan-pan' girl and drown my sorrows in some cheap booze for once."
Clutching his engineer's cap, Kiyokichi turned to leave.
"Kiyokichi-kun, I know you're upset, but please, finish this job first," the Company President urged, having just arrived on the scene.
"I decline."
"Kiyokichi, surely you aren't serious?"
"You're joking, right?"
"Come now, there's no need for such anger."
They tried to soothe him, but the stubborn Kiyokichi walked out without another word. A ship without him was a ship without a soul. The captain was getting on in years, and there was no one but Kiyokichi fit to succeed him. With him gone, who would handle the temperamental engine? The remaining crew stood there, stunned.
"Captain, will you be alright?" the President asked, his voice thick with worry.
"Don't you worry, President. I've been forged by thirty years at sea!"
"True... but one can't win against old age."
It was because of this rift that the shipment...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** This is a classic example of a "Bungei" (literary) or "Pulp" magazine layout from the mid-Showa era. It uses vertical text (tategaki), reading from top-to-bottom and right-to-left.
*   **Typography:** The title is rendered in a stylized, hand-drawn font that evokes a sense of mystery and adventure. The author's name, Kamiyama Eizo, is placed below the title in a smaller, standard font.
*   **Illustrations:** There is a simple, high-contrast silhouette illustration of a motor-sailing ship (kisen-hansen). The blocky, almost woodcut style is typical of budget-conscious periodicals of the era.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is organized into two horizontal registers (top and bottom), which is a common way to fit more text onto a single page in Japanese magazines.
*   **Dialogue Formatting:** Dialogue is indicated by traditional Japanese quotation marks (「 」), and each speaker usually starts on a new line, creating a fast-paced, script-like rhythm to the reading experience.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-War 1940s-50s):** Several clues point to the early post-war period (approx. 1945–1952). The mention of "Bis-groups" (biscuit gangs or black market groups) and "Guerrilla ships" reflects the lawlessness of the immediate post-war era.
*   **"Pan-pan" Girls:** The mention of "holding a pan-pan" is a direct reference to the street-walking prostitutes who catered to the Allied occupation forces. This term is iconic of the late 1940s.
*   **Repatriation (Kikan):** The captain mentions that Kiyokichi has been rebellious since he "returned" (帰還 - kikan). This implies Kiyokichi is a veteran who recently returned from the front lines of WWII.
*   **Task Force (Kido Butai):** Kiyokichi is described as the "Leopard of the Sea" in the *Kido Butai* (Mobile Force/Task Force), which was the primary carrier strike group of the Imperial Japanese Navy. This background explains his technical skill with engines and his tough-guy persona.
*   **Geographic Setting:** The Akashi Strait (between Kobe and Awaji Island) has historically been a vital but treacherous shipping lane, making it a perfect setting for a maritime mystery.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **怪機帆船 (Kaiki-hansen):** A "Mysterious Motor-Sailing Ship." A *hansen* is a sailing ship; a *kihansen* is a ship equipped with both sails and an auxiliary engine.
*   **女狼 (Joro):** Literally "Woman-Wolf." This likely refers to a "vixen" or a dangerous, predatory woman who will appear later in the story.
*   **封建的 (Hokenteki):** "Feudalistic." In the post-war era, this became a popular buzzword to criticize the old-fashioned, hierarchical ways of the Japanese military and traditional society.
*   **機關士 (Kikanshi):** Engineer. In this context, the person responsible for the ship's engine.
*   **轍の鮒 (Wadachi no funa):** "A carp in a dry rut." A metaphor for someone in a desperate, helpless situation (from a Chinese fable).
*   **色酒 (Irozake):** Literally "colored sake," usually referring to drinking in a red-light district or a place where women serve alcohol.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Generational Conflict:** The core of this excerpt is the clash between the aging Captain (representing the old guard/Meiji-Taisho era) and the young, war-hardened Engineer (representing the post-war generation). The Captain relies on "spirit" and "iron and bronze" experience, while Kiyokichi is more cynical and concerned with intelligence and modern logistics.
*   **Superstition vs. Reality:** The "Ghost Ships" are presented as a mystery. The older generation (the office staff/Captain) is scared of the "ghosts," while Kiyokichi suspects a more grounded reality: a spy network and organized crime.
*   **Post-War Malaise:** Kiyokichi’s threat to quit and go "hold a pan-pan girl" reflects the nihilism and social breakdown common in post-war "Kasutori" (pulp) literature.
*   **The "Engine" as Soul:** The text emphasizes that the engineer is the "soul" of the ship. This reflects Japan's transition into a more mechanical, industrial society where the technician's importance rivals the traditional leader's.
