**第五十二話**
**マネキンガールの猛攻**
**或る美男の話**

店の前で行列をして品物を買ったなどゝいうのは昔の夢。統制の大幅解除でダブつき出した品物の投げ賣りで俄然、宣傳戦は活撥になり出した。とりわけ百貨店の宣傳ぶり、そこで脚光を浴びてマネキン嬢の活躍は一段と凄まじくなるのだ。まあ、どこのデパートでもいいから入つて見給え、田舎者ならビックリするよ。

ウロウロと歩いている君の鼻先に、プンと香料のなやましい匂い――。
突然！いとも麗わしき娘が、サーッと電光石火の早業で、君の手を握つてくれる。若しその心臓型なら、握つた君の手を絶対に離さないから。
「君の胸がドキリ、…ドキリ。
「如何でございます。アレ止めの舶来のクリームでございます。こうしてホンの少し塗って寝んで頂きますと、朝お起きになると見違える様にツヤヽヽと滑らかになっておりますのよ――」
そして君の手に塗るその拍手に、グッと一ツ、力を籠めて握ってくれるに違いない。君が逃走のチャンスを逸したる良きカモと見られるや、横手から又一人の麗人が飛んでくる。
「舶来ものに負けぬ乳液でございます。こうして殿方の御顔に登って頂きますと、匂いもよく、お顔は見違える様に若さを増して参ります」

彼女は必ずや、君のニキビ顔に頬を近づけて、優しい白い指で、ソッ君のヒゲ面の頬を快く撫でてくれるに違いない。
君はそこでニヤついていると、途端に又一人の麗人が駆け寄ってくる。「如何ですか、このポマードは此の度新發賣の、一度使って頂きましたら永久に忘れることの出来ないいい匂いの上、おグシの榮養になるのでございます。どうぞお試し下さいませ」

彼女はいきなり君のフケだらけの頭髪にベッタリとポマードを塗りつけて、ニッコリ笑ってくれるだろう。
君は、それらの品物を買わされて夢中になった擧句、手を握り頬を撫でられたからと言つてデパートの退け刻、店員出入口で待ち構えて手を握りアワよくばキッスなどと思つてはダメだよ。
「まぁ、いやらしい、失禮な、えッ？、今日手を握って笑つてウインクして呉れたからだつて？、御冗談でしょ商賣と一緒にされたんじやないわよ。さ、さ、どいて頂戴、家で坊やが待つてるんだから。それとも、明日、又クリームを買つてくれるんだったら、そのかわりお負けに一分余計に手を握つてあげるからね」
そして彼女は君に見向きもせずさつさと黄昏の歩道を横切つて行く。えらい詳しいねつて、いやヤボクもね実はそれでフラれたのさ。

**One Hundred Tales of Strange Stories**
**Sighs of the City**
**By Shinshi Kanro / Illustrated by Sanpei**

**Episode 52**
**The Mannequin Girl's Fierce Attack**
**A Story of a Certain Handsome Man**

The thing about lining up in front of stores to buy goods is a dream of the past. With the large-scale lifting of controls, the dumping of surplus goods has suddenly made the advertising war active. Especially the advertising style of department stores; the activities of the mannequin ladies who bask in the spotlight there become even more fierce. Well, try entering any department store, if you are a person from the countryside, you will be surprised.

As you wander around, to your nose tip, a whiff of troubling perfume scent—-.
Suddenly! An extremely beautiful girl, with a lightning-fast technique, grabs your hand. If she is that "heart type," she will absolutely not let go of the hand she grabbed.
"Your heart goes dokiri... dokiri.
"How is it? This is an imported cream for [skin protection]. If you apply just a little like this and rest, when you wake up in the morning, it will be glossily smooth to the point of being unrecognizable—"
And at the moment she applies it to your hand, she will surely grip it with a squeeze of strength. Once you are seen as a good 'duck' (easy target) who missed the chance to escape, another beauty flies in from the side.
"This is a milky lotion not inferior to imported goods. If you apply this to a gentleman's face, the scent is good, and your face will increase in youthfulness to the point of being unrecognizable."

She will surely bring her cheek close to your acne-covered face and, with gentle white fingers, softly stroke your bearded cheek pleasantly.
While you are there smirking, another beauty immediately runs up. "How is this? This pomade is newly released; once you use it, it has a good scent you can never forget, plus it becomes nutrition for your hair. Please try it."

She will suddenly smear pomade thickly onto your dandruff-covered hair and smile at you.
After being made to buy those items and becoming entranced, just because your hand was held and your cheek stroked, do not think about waiting at the employee entrance at closing time to hold her hand or maybe get a kiss.
"My, how disgusting, how rude. Eh? Because I held your hand and smiled and winked today? You must be joking, don't lump it together with business. Come on, move aside, my boy is waiting at home. Or, if you buy cream again tomorrow, in exchange I'll hold your hand for one extra minute as a bonus."
And she, without even looking at you, quickly crosses the twilight sidewalk. "You sure are detailed," you say? No, I actually got dumped that way too.

**Episode 53**
**A World of Ero-Service**
**M-kun's Story**

When money becomes tight, cafes, salons, and bars are in a frenzy squeezing out advertising slogans.
"Currently, a grand increase of 500 beautiful ladies."
"A super service style that melts body and soul for only 300 yen."
By such subway advertisements, thinking 300 yen is cheap in these times, one ends up wandering in...

**One Hundred Urban Oddities**
**Metropolitan Sighs**
**Written by Shinshi Kanro | Illustrated by Sanpei**

**Chapter 52: The Mannequin Girl’s Onslaught**
**The Tale of a Certain Dandy**

The days of queuing up just to buy basic necessities are now a distant memory. With the lifting of wartime economic controls, the market is flooded with surplus goods, and the "advertising war" has ignited with a vengeance. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the department stores, where the "mannequin girls"—the sales demonstrators—command the spotlight with terrifying intensity. If you’re a country bumpkin stepping into a city department store for the first time, prepare to be stunned.

As you stroll aimlessly through the aisles, a provocative waft of perfume hits you. Before you know it, a stunning young woman has snatched your hand with lightning speed. If she’s the predatory type, she won’t let go. 
Your heart thumps—*thump, thump.*
"How do you find it, sir? This is an exquisite imported cream. Just a dab before bed, and by morning your skin will be so radiantly smooth you won't even recognize yourself."
As she rubs the cream into your skin, she gives your hand a firm, suggestive squeeze. The moment they realize you're a "sitting duck" who’s missed his chance to escape, another beauty swoops in from the flank.
"And here is a lotion that rivals any import! If a gentleman applies this to his face, the fragrance is divine, and you’ll look years younger in an instant."

She leans in, her cheek nearly touching your acne-prone face, her delicate white fingers stroking your scruffy jawline. 
While you stand there grinning like an idiot, a third beauty rushes over. "And what about this? It’s our latest pomade. Use it once and you’ll never forget the scent; plus, it’s remarkably nourishing for the hair. Do try some!"

Without warning, she slathers the thick grease onto your dandruff-ridden scalp and flashes you a brilliant smile. 
Now, don’t get the wrong idea. Just because you were mesmerized into buying the lot and she held your hand and stroked your face, don't think you can loiter by the employee exit at closing time hoping for a date or a kiss.
"Ugh, how gross! How rude of you! What? Because I held your hand and winked today? Don't be ridiculous—that was strictly business! Now, out of my way; I have a son waiting for me at home. Of course, if you come back tomorrow and buy more cream, maybe I’ll throw in an extra minute of hand-holding as a bonus."
And with that, she marches across the street into the twilight without a backward glance. 
You think I’m suspiciously well-informed? Well... truth be told, that’s exactly how I got dumped.

**Chapter 53: A World of "Ero-Service"**
**The Story of M-kun**

With the economy tightening, cafes, bars, and "salons" are scrambling to invent the most enticing slogans to lure in customers.
"Five hundred beauties just added to the staff!"
"Body and soul-melting 'Super Service' for only 300 yen!"
Seeing such ads in the subway, one thinks, "300 yen? That's a steal in this day and age!" and finds oneself drifting toward the door...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The page is designed as a serialized feature, likely from a "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine. It uses a three-column vertical layout for the body text, framed by a decorative border.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "都会の溜息" (Metropolitan Sighs) is the largest and most prominent, written in a stylized, hand-drawn font. The sub-headings for the specific "Episodes" (52 and 53) use a bold, serifed typeface to break up the narrative.
*   **Illustrations:** Three distinct cartoon illustrations are interspersed within the text. They are "Heta-uma" (bad-but-good) or "Manga" style, typical of the era, focusing on the expressive, slightly exaggerated reactions of the characters (the aggressive saleswomen and the overwhelmed male customer).
*   **Typography:** The text uses "Kyujitai" (old kanji forms) and traditional kana usage (though relatively modern for the time). Right-to-left orientation is used for the main title, which was common in pre-war and early post-war publications before left-to-right became the standard.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Transition:** The text explicitly mentions the "lifting of controls" (統制の解除). During WWII, the Japanese economy was strictly controlled. The late 1940s saw the return of a consumer market, leading to aggressive (and sometimes deceptive) sales tactics as businesses competed for scarce cash.
*   **Mannequin Girls (マネキンガール):** These were not plastic statues but live sales demonstrators, often young women. They were a symbol of "modern" city life. The essay satirizes how they used physical touch and flirtation as a high-pressure sales tactic to sell cosmetics like "Hakurai" (imported) creams.
*   **Ero-Service (エロ・サービス):** This term refers to the "Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense" (Ero-Guro-Nansensu) subculture that flourished in the 1920s-30s and saw a resurgence in post-war "Kasutori" magazines. It describes a culture of semi-legal or grey-market entertainment (cafes, bars, "salons") that sold flirtation and companionship.
*   **Currency & Inflation:** The mention of "300 yen" for service provides a snapshot of post-war inflation. In the late 40s/early 50s, 300 yen was a significant but "affordable" amount for a luxury or a night out for a salaryman.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **マネキン嬢 (Mannequin-jo):** Literally "Miss Mannequin." A live model/demonstrator.
*   **舶来 (Hakurai):** Literally "shipped from overseas." In this era, anything "Hakurai" (especially from the West) was considered high-status and superior quality.
*   **カモ (Kamo):** "Duck." Slang for an easy target or a sucker (someone easily swindled).
*   **おグシ (O-gushi):** An honorific/archaic term for hair (typically used for women, here used mockingly by the saleswoman).
*   **ポマード (Pomade):** A greasy hair styling product extremely popular for men in the mid-20th century.
*   **大童 (O-warawa):** To be in a state of frantic activity or "all hands on deck."
*   **フラフラ (Fura-fura):** An onomatopoeic expression for wandering aimlessly or being lured in helplessly.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Gender Dynamics:** The text portrays women as predatory and business-minded, using their sexuality to extract money from gullible, lonely men. This reflects a common post-war male anxiety regarding the changing social roles and the perceived "toughness" of women surviving in the ruins.
*   **Urban Cynicism:** The title "Metropolitan Sighs" suggests a weariness with the chaos and deception of city life. The "handsome man" in the story is not a hero but a victim of his own vanity and the city's commercial ruthlessness.
*   **Consumerism vs. Reality:** The contrast between the "dream" of the sales pitch (glowing skin, youth) and the reality of the customer (acne-faced, dandruff-ridden, broke) serves as a satirical critique of the burgeoning advertising industry.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Satirical Essay, Magazine Feature, Humorous Fiction.
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Consumerism, Gender Relations, Urban Life, Satire, Advertising, Eroticism (light).
*   **Classification:** Social Commentary / Pulp Literature.
