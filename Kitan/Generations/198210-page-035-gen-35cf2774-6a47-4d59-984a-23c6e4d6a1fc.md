## Literal English Translation

[The article] lists the title of the mother-son incest article which recently crowded the pages, and notes that it feels just like mother-son incest is a popular trend.
Also, Mr. Kakinuma writes that the phenomenon of mother-son incest has a strange allure.
Certainly, the appealing quality is that of desiring the sacred to remain sacred, but then defiling and violating it. Women teachers, nuns, high school girls, etc., have been subjects repeatedly targeted until now.
And now, in the present, where even the mother—who should be absolutely sacred to the child—has been defiled, does the sacred no longer exist? Or rather, perhaps the sacred never existed in the first place. If we look inside what we believed to be sacred, perhaps they were all just human beings.
Nevertheless, for the transgressor (the one who violates), it is better if the sacred exists. Because the highest pleasure is attained by lowering the sacred, which stands equal to oneself, down below that level.

In Greek mythology, there is the story of Oedipus, who, unknowingly, married his true mother, and who later, upon learning the truth, gouged out his own eyes. Compared to this tale, the image of a mother and son playing sexually, and afterwards, sitting around the dinner table with the husband or brother with an innocent face, is far more terrifying.
In “Mother and Child in the Secret Room,” the modern Oedipus is depicted as extremely weak, but is that truly the case? He calmly makes his mother masturbate, makes his mother perform fellatio, and ejaculates inside her mouth. And, he doesn't think anything of his father. The Greek Oedipus would surely be surprised by this.

Five years ago, the Italian master Pasolini, who departed after being brutally murdered by a youth who was said to be his lover—leaving *Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom* as his final message—made a film based on Oedipus called *Appolon’s Hell*. At that time, he spoke openly about having had a mother-son incestuous relationship, stating that it was "not a matter close at hand, but something I myself lived through."

The day may come when laws prohibiting mother-son incest are created in our country. Conversely, the time may also come when other countries, learning from Japan, choose to lift such bans. This is unknowable to this writer, who is neither a lawyer nor a researcher.

## Literary English Translation

The author [of the preceding text] cites the title of a recent article on mother-son incest that has been crowding the literary pages, noting that it creates the impression that mother-son incest is becoming a major trend.
Furthermore, Mr. Kakinuma writes that the current phenomenon of mother-son incest possesses a mysterious allure.
Indeed, the attraction lies in the violation and defilement of something desired to remain sacred. Female teachers, nuns, and high school girls have historically been the repeated subjects of this fascination.
And now, in a time when even the mother—who should be absolutely sacred to her child—has been defiled, does the sacred no longer exist? Or perhaps, the sacred never truly existed in the first place. If we peer beneath the surface of what we believed to be holy, we might find that they were all merely human.
Nevertheless, for the transgressor, it is preferable that the sacred *does* exist. This is because the highest pleasure is derived from taking something sacred, which stands equal to oneself, and systematically degrading it below one's own level.

In the myths of Greece, there is the story of Oedipus, who unknowingly took his own mother as wife, and who later, upon discovering the truth, gouged out his own eyes. When compared to this legend, the image of a mother and son who have sexually indulged, and who immediately afterwards sit around the dinner table with the husband or brother, feigning utter innocence, is far more terrifying.

In the work “Mother and Child in the Secret Room,” the modern Oedipus is portrayed as excessively weak, but is that depiction accurate? He calmly forces his mother to masturbate, compels her to perform fellatio, and ejaculates directly into her mouth. He feels no remorse whatsoever concerning his father. Surely, the Greek Oedipus would be astonished by this.

Five years ago, the Italian master Pasolini, who was brutally murdered by a youth said to have been his lover—leaving *Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom* as his final message—made the film *Appolon’s Hell* based on the Oedipus myth. At that time, he openly admitted to having been in an incestuous relationship with his mother, stating that it was “not a casual matter, but something I myself lived through.”

A day may come when our nation enacts laws prohibiting mother-son incest. Conversely, the time may also arrive when other countries look to Japan and decide to decriminalize such relationships. This remains unknowable to this writer, who is neither a legal expert nor an academic researcher.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Field | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Cultural Commentary / Editorial Essay / Reportage on contemporary sexual trends and literature, blending academic reference (mythology, film) with sensationalist tropes. |
| **Author Attribution** | Anonymous or uncredited ("筆者にはわからないことである"). Cites "柿沼氏" (Mr. Kakinuma), suggesting commentary based on another published opinion or a known contemporary intellectual. |
| **Editorial/Narrator Voice** | Clinical, intellectualized, yet highly sensationalist. The voice attempts to analyze transgressive behavior (incest) using psychological concepts (the profanation of the sacred) but emphasizes the horrific and perverse elements of the modern examples. |
| **Target Audience** | Readers of *ero-guro* publications (like *Kitan Club*), interested in highly taboo sexual content, foreign cinema, Greek mythology, and the psychological roots of perversity. |
| **Contextual References** | Specific reference to events "Five years ago" (Pasolini's 1975 murder) dates the writing approximately to the **late 1970s or early 1980s** (Late Showa period). |
| **Internal Structure** | 1. Introduction of Mother-Son Incest as a "trend." 2. Psychological theory: The allure of defiling the "Sacred" (mother, nun, teacher). 3. Contrast: Mythological tragedy (Oedipus) vs. Modern, casual perversity (the scene from "密室の母と子"). 4. Historical precedent: Pasolini's film and personal confession. 5. Conclusion: Ambiguous speculation on future legal status in Japan. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Term/Reference | Contextual Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **母子相姦 (Boshi Sōkan)** | Mother-son incest. This was the ultimate violation of the Japanese family structure (Ie system) and traditional morality, frequently sensationalized in postwar *Kitan Club* type magazines as the epitome of the ero-guro aesthetic: combining the sexual (ero) with the psychologically grotesque (guro). |
| **神聖なもの (Shinsei na mono)** | "The Sacred." In post-war Japan, with the Emperor stripped of divinity, the search for remaining "sacred" figures focused on institutions representing purity, education, or tradition (nuns, teachers, mothers). Defiling these targets reflects a deeper anxiety about societal moral collapse. |
| **女教師や尼僧・女高生 (Female teachers, nuns, high school girls)** | Standard targets for violation fantasies in 20th-century Japanese pulp literature. They represent purity, authority, or burgeoning innocence, making their defilement a common trope for expressing rebellion or profound transgression. |
| **オイディプス (Oedipus)** | The text uses the classical Greek tragedy to contrast "unknowing", self-punishing transgression with the "knowing," casual, and unrepentant perversity of the modern fictional character. This contrast legitimizes the modern transgression as a deeper form of horror. |
| **『ソドムの市』 (Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom)** | Pier Paolo Pasolini's final, 1975 film. The film is notorious for its unflinching depiction of sexual sadism, fascism, and moral decay. The reference to it being his "final message" frames Pasolini as a martyr or prophet of decadence. |
| **パゾリーニ (Pasolini)** | Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922-1975). Italian intellectual, openly gay filmmaker, and radical Marxist. His murder by a young male prostitute in 1975 was a huge international scandal. The text connects his personal history of incest (which he publicly disclosed) directly to his work on *Oedipus Rex* (Appolon's Hell). |
| **五年前 (Five years ago)** | This dates the article to roughly 1980, five years after Pasolini's death in late 1975. This confirms the article's temporal placement within the late Showa era (1926-1989). |
| **何食わぬ顔 (Nanikuwanu kao)** | Feigning innocence; acting as if nothing happened. This behavioral marker—the casualness after the extreme transgression—is what the author finds most horrifying about the modern depiction of incest. |
| **法律 (Law)** | Japan does not have a specific statutory crime called "incest" (*sōkan*) but relies on prohibitions within the Civil Code (kinship marriage prohibitions) and laws concerning indecent assault, especially involving minors or non-consensual acts. The author's speculation about new anti-incest laws reflects a contemporary debate about rising moral panic. |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term (Kanji/Kana) | Standard Meaning | Historical/Contextual Nuance | NLP/AI Tag |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **母子相姦 (boshi sōkan)** | Mother-son incest. | Highly taboo, the centerpiece of the article's sensationalism. | SEXUAL_TABOO |
| **誌上を賑はした (shijō o nigiwashita)** | Crowded the pages (of magazines/journals). | Indicates widespread media sensation, implying controversy and high sales figures. | PULP_MEDIA |
| **神聖 (shinsei)** | Sacred, holy. | Used ironically or structurally; its existence is necessary for the psychological mechanism of profanation (defilement) to work. | PSYCH_CONCEPT |
| **汚す・犯す (yogosu / okasu)** | Defile / Violate, rape. | Key action verbs describing the transgression against the sacred mother figure. | VIOLATION |
| **フェラチオ (ferachio)** | Fellatio (loanword). | Explicit sexual term, reinforcing the modern, clinical, and perverse nature of the act. | SEXUAL_ACT |
| **何食わぬ顔 (nanikuwanu kao)** | Innocent face, feigning ignorance. | Semantic pivot that defines the modern horror: the removal of shame and tragedy post-act. | SHAME_ABSENCE |
| **おと〔?〕しめ (otoshime)** | To look down upon, to disparage, to degrade. (Most likely 貶しめ). | Crucial verb describing the source of pleasure: reducing the superior sacred object to an inferior, controllable status. | POWER_DYNAMIC |
| **巨匠 (kyoshō)** | Master, maestro. | Used respectfully for Pasolini, contrasting his artistic genius with his shocking personal life and violent end. | CULTURAL_STATUS |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

| Theme/Subtext | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Profanation of the Sacred** | The central psychological mechanism explored. Sexual thrill is derived not just from the act, but from the violation of the most socially and spiritually revered figure (the Mother), proving its fragility or non-existence. |
| **The Modern Oedipus** | The text argues that the true terror is not tragic self-discovery (as in the myth) but *deliberate, casual, and unpunished perversity*. The modern figure is a psycho-sexual terrorist, not a tragic hero. |
| **Casualized Transgression** | The shift from Oedipus (unknowing, self-punishing) to the character in *Mother and Child in the Secret Room* (knowing, casually having oral sex, then sitting at the dinner table) suggests a deep anxiety about moral decay and the disappearance of shame in post-war Japan. |
| **Voyeurism and Sensation** | By citing literature (Kakinuma's views, the unnamed novel) and controversial foreign film (Pasolini), the text caters to the reader's intellectualized voyeurism, positioning the transgression as a subject of high cultural debate, not mere vulgarity. |
| **Anxiety over Legal and Moral Boundaries** | The final paragraph reflects societal confusion. Should the state intervene (ban incest)? Or has Japan become so advanced in its acceptance of perversity that it will lead the world in lifting taboos? This ambiguity heightens the sense of living in a lawless, transitional era. |
