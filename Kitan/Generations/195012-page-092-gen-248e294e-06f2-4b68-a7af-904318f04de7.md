「あたし、帰らして頂きます」
と、小声で言ったが、松井は笑って、
「ハ、ハ、何も、怖がる事はありやしませんよ」
「でも、あたし……」
「まあ、まあおちなさい」
そう言つて、無理に清子を椅子につかせた。その時、室内の電燈が一せいに消えた。カタカタカタと響く、映写機の音。スクリーンには最初に、露骨に撮られたエロチックなシーンが大写しとなつて現れていた。彼女は肩へかかる松井の腕を、はねのける元気もなく、強烈な酒でものんだときのように、もうろうとした意識で、身体をしびれさせていた。

翌朝、タイル張りの綺麗な浴室で、澄み切つた風呂へ手足をひたしながら、湯気にもつれた天井をみつめて、悪夢のような一夜を思い返した。
二十年間、守つて来た「処女」は、ほんの数時間で、別れを告げてしまつたのだつた。が、別に後悔はなかつた。
「処女だからつて、大して自慢になるもんぢやないわ」
一人言して、匂やかな湯の中で、だるい身体を思い切り伸ばしてみた。そして、松井が、帰りぎわに彼女の手に握らせた、数十枚の百円紙幣の使いみちを考えた。
しかし、そんなのんきな気持の片隅には、湯気のようにほんのりと沈む感情もあつたが、
「もう今更、考えたつて仕様がないわ。真面目につまらなく暮すより、愉快にすごした方がいいわ」
よく浴槽から、ザアつと湯の音をたてゝ、タイルの床の上へ、飛びおりた。

それからの清子は、たゞのサービスガールとしてではなく、松井のパトナーとして、エメラルドクラブへ毎夜出入りした。
だが、思いがけぬ不幸が清子を愕然とさせた。
妊娠！　全然それは、考えてもいないことだつた。
ある夜、彼女は松井にそれを打ちあけた。勿論、色々と考えあぐんだ末だつた。心配する事はないと言われる事を予期して言つたのだが、
「ほう。それはお目出度い。お祝いしよう。だが、パパは分つているのかね」
そういう返事なのだ。処女を松井にまかせて、それからだつて、他の男の腕になど、抱かれた事のない彼女が、どうして、松井以外の男の子を妊娠するだろうか？
そんな馬鹿な……。
その一言で、ぐつとこみあげた涙を、一生懸命におさえて、
「あら！　冗談おつしやっちやいや」
所かと思つていたけれど、思った程では、なかつたわ）

ホッとしてアームチェヤーにふか／＼と腰をおろして、ボーイが云つた出演通知のベルが鳴るのをまつていた。
もうそろそろベルが鳴る時分だと思つて居ると入口の扉が開いて、着流しの和服姿の若い男が入つて来た。
ボーイの説明にはなかつた事なので、どうしてよいか、と判断に苦しんでいる間に男はつか／＼と追つて来て、いきなり由美の手を捉えて乱暴にベットの上へ押し倒した。
「アッ」由美は思わず悲鳴を上げた。
夢中で男をのけて、裾の乱れも構わず、開いたまゝの扉から飛び出した。廊下は由美の逃げ場を暗示する様に左へのびていた。男は無言のまゝで由美を追つて来る。しかしダンスで鍛えた、敏捷な由美を捉える事は男にとつて容易な事ではなかつた。
由美は廊下の行き当りを左に折れた所で、ハッと行きどまつてしまつた。長くつづいているものと思つていた廊下は、そこで行き詰りになつて居て、頑丈な扉が行手をはばんでいる　男の足はすぐ後に追つて来た。
（あ、たれか……。）
藁をもつかむ思いで扉を押してみると、軽くひらいた。飛び込んだ部屋の向う側は扉が半開きになつている。
その扉を出ると目の前が、パッと明るくなつた。
（アッ舞台だ）
舞台生活者の直観で突嗟にそう感じた瞬間、反射的に身をひるがえして、もと来た道に引返そうとした。勿論舞台をつき切つてしまえば下手へ逃げる道はあつた。然し背後に危険を感じて居ても開演中の舞台を、突き抜ける事は舞台人としての良心が、許さなかつた。
「千枝、此んな所にいたのか、こ」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"I, will be having myself return," she said in a small voice, but Matsui laughed, "Ha, ha, anything, to be afraid of there is not."
"But, I..."
"Now, now, calm down."
So saying, forcibly he made Kiyoko sit in a chair. At that time, the indoor electric lights all at once vanished. *Kata-kata-kata* echoed, the sound of a projector. On the screen, first, crudely filmed erotic scenes in a large close-up appeared. She, for the strength to shake off Matsui's arm hanging on her shoulder, lacked even that; as if she had drunk strong liquor, with a hazy consciousness, she let her body go numb.

×　　　×　　　×

The next morning, in a tile-covered beautiful bathroom, while soaking hands and feet in a clear bath, staring at the ceiling tangled in steam, she recalled the nightmare-like night.
For twenty years, the "virginity" she had guarded, in just a few hours, had said its farewell. However, particularly regret there was none.
"Just because of being a virgin, it's not much to be proud of," she spoke to herself, and in the fragrant hot water, tried stretching her weary body to the limit. Then, she thought of the usage of several dozen 100-yen banknotes that Matsui had pressed into her hand upon leaving.
However, in a corner of such a carefree feeling, there was a feeling sinking faintly like steam, but,
"Already now, even if I think about it, it can't be helped. Rather than living seriously and boringly, living pleasantly is better."
Vigorously from the bathtub, with a *zaa* splashing sound of water, she jumped down onto the tile floor.

Kiyoko from then on, not as a mere service girl, but as Matsui's partner, every night frequented the Emerald Club.
But, an unexpected misfortune made Kiyoko aghast.
Pregnancy! Entirely, that was a thing she had not even thought of.
One night, she confessed it to Matsui. Of course, it was after much agonizing. Expecting to be told "There is no need to worry," she said it, but,
"Ho. That is celebratory. Let us celebrate. But, does the 'Papa' know?"
That was the reply. Having entrusted her virginity to Matsui, and since then, never having been held in another man's arms, why would she be pregnant with a child of a man other than Matsui?
Such nonsense...
With that one word, suppressing tears that welled up sharply with all her might,
"Oh! Please don't say such jokes..."

(Second section)
...thought it was, but it wasn't as much as I thought.)
Relieved, she sat deeply in the armchair, waiting for the performance notification bell the boy mentioned to ring.
Just when she thought it was about time for the bell to ring, the entrance door opened, and a young man in a casual *kinagashi* kimono entered.
Since it was something not in the boy's explanation, while she was struggling to judge what to do, the man came walking briskly, suddenly grabbed Yumi's hand, and violently pushed her down onto the bed.
"Ah!" Yumi unintentionally let out a scream.
Distractedly pushing the man away, regardless of her disheveled hem, she jumped out of the open door. The hallway stretched to the left as if suggesting Yumi's escape route. The man followed Yumi in silence. However, for the man, capturing the agile Yumi, trained in dance, was not an easy thing.
Yumi, at the place where she turned left at the end of the hallway, suddenly came to a stop. The hallway she thought continued long was a dead end there, and a sturdy door blocked the way. The man's footsteps followed right behind.
(Ah, someone...)
With a feeling of clutching at straws, she pushed the door, and it opened lightly. On the other side of the room she jumped into, a door was half-open.
Stepping out of that door, the front became suddenly bright.
(Ah, it's the stage!)
The moment she felt that instinctively as a stage professional, she reflexively turned her body to go back the way she came. Of course, if she ran across the stage, there was a path to escape to stage left. However, even feeling the danger behind her, cutting through a stage during a performance was something her conscience as a stage person would not permit.
"Chie, so you were in a place like this..."

"I... I think I should be going home," she whispered.
Matsui only laughed. "Ha! There’s nothing to be afraid of here."
"But..."
"Now, now. Just relax."
He forced Kiyoko back into her chair. At that moment, the lights went out all at once. The steady *clack-clack-clack* of a film projector filled the room. On the screen, a sequence of raw, erotic close-ups began to play. Kiyoko felt Matsui’s arm drape over her shoulder, but she lacked the strength to pull away. Her mind was in a haze, her body numb, as if she had been forced to down a glass of potent liquor.

The next morning, in a beautiful tiled bathroom, she soaked her limbs in the crystal-clear water. Staring up at the steam curling against the ceiling, she relived the nightmare of the previous night. 
She had guarded her virginity for twenty years, only to lose it in a matter of hours. And yet, she felt no real regret. 
"It’s not like being a virgin is some great badge of honor anyway," she muttered to herself. She stretched her weary body in the fragrant water and began to calculate how to spend the thick stack of hundred-yen bills Matsui had pressed into her hand before he left.
A faint, melancholy shadow flitted through her mind, like wisps of steam, but she brushed it aside. 
"It’s too late for second-guessing now. Better to live a life of pleasure than a life of dull, honest misery." 
She stood up, water cascading off her as she leapt onto the tiled floor.

From then on, Kiyoko was more than just a "service girl"; she became Matsui's regular partner, accompanying him every night to the Emerald Club. 
But then, disaster struck.
Pregnancy. It was something that had never even crossed her mind.
One night, after much agonizing, she confessed the truth to Matsui. She had expected him to reassure her, to tell her everything would be fine. Instead, he replied: 
"Well now, that’s quite the occasion. We should celebrate. But tell me—do you even know who the 'Papa' is?"
She was stunned. She had given her virginity to Matsui, and since that night, no other man had so much as touched her. How could he suggest it was anyone else's child? 
The absurdity of it stung. Fighting back the tears that threatened to spill over, she managed a strained response:
"Oh! You... you must be joking..."

(Second section)
...wasn't quite as bad as I'd expected.)
Relieved, she sank into the armchair, waiting for the bell the bellhop had mentioned to signal her call to the stage.
Just as she thought it was about time, the door swung open and a young man wearing a casual kimono burst in. This wasn't part of the plan the bellhop had described. While she sat there frozen, wondering what to do, the man lunged at her, grabbed her wrists, and violently threw her onto the bed.
"Ah!" Yumi screamed despite herself.
She fought him off with desperate strength and bolted through the open door, her kimono trailing behind her. The hallway stretched to the left—her only escape. The man pursued her in eerie silence. But Yumi was a dancer, agile and quick; catching her would be no easy feat. 
She rounded a corner at the end of the hall, only to gasp as she hit a dead end. The passage she thought went on forever stopped abruptly at a heavy, locked door. She could hear his footsteps closing in. 
(Someone... help!)
She threw her weight against a side door in a final, desperate prayer. It gave way. She scrambled through into another room where a door on the far side stood ajar. 
She burst through it—and was suddenly blinded by brilliant light.
(The stage!)
Her performer's instinct told her immediately where she was. She started to whirl around to retreat, but stopped. She could have sprinted across the stage to the wings to escape, but even with the threat at her back, her professional conscience wouldn't let her disrupt a live performance.
"Chie, so this is where you were..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** Typical magazine layout of the mid-20th century. The text is set in vertical columns (tategaki). There is a clear visual break between the first story (Kiyoko) and the second (Yumi/Chie), separated by a horizontal illustration.
*   **Typography:** Small, dense lead type. The use of "× × ×" acts as a scene transition. The "4" (written as 四) indicates a chapter or section break. 
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing of several nude women in a communal bath or classical setting. This serves as "eye candy" to attract readers, common in *Kasutori* magazines where the eroticism of the art often exceeded the actual explicitness of the text.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the story is likely on a previous page. The text flows around the illustration, creating a somewhat cluttered but dynamic page typical of cheap pulp publications.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s (early Showa post-war). Japan was under Allied Occupation. 
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term "Kasutori" refers to a cheap, dregs-based shochu (liquor). Like the liquor, these magazines were "cheap, got you drunk quickly (with excitement), and left you with a bad hangover." They were the primary source of entertainment for the masses during the reconstruction era.
*   **Service Girls (サービスガール):** A term for women who worked in the entertainment industry—cafes, dance halls, and bars. This era saw a significant shift in sexual politics as traditional morals crumbled in the face of post-war poverty and Western influence.
*   **"Virginity" (処女):** The narrative reflects a transitional period where the loss of virginity is treated with both traditional gravity (the "nightmare") and a new, cynical pragmatism (the 100-yen bills and the "it's not much to be proud of" attitude).
*   **Currency:** The mention of "hundred-yen bills" (百円紙幣) suggests a period before hyper-inflation or right at the start of it. In the late 40s, 100 yen was a significant amount of money.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **処女 (Shojo):** Virginity. In this context, it carries the weight of a woman's "value" in the marriage market of the time.
*   **サービスガール (Sābisugāru):** "Service girl." A euphemism for a woman working in a bar or club, often implying sex work or "pan-pan" girls.
*   **おちなさい (Ochinasai):** A colloquial/older way of saying "calm down" (落ち着きなさい).
*   **着流し (Kinagashi):** Wearing a kimono casually without a formal *hakama*. Often associated with "bad boys," actors, or bohemian types in this era.
*   **下手 (Shimote):** Stage left. A technical theater term used in the second story.
*   **舞台人としての良心 (Butaijin to shite no ryōshin):** "Conscience of a stage person." This highlights the character's professional pride even in a moment of mortal peril.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Fallen Woman" Trope:** Kiyoko's story follows the classic arc of a woman losing her innocence, being seduced by wealth/luxury (the Emerald Club), and then being betrayed/discarded upon pregnancy.
*   **Cynicism vs. Morality:** There is a strong subtext of post-war nihilism. "Rather than living seriously and boringly, living pleasantly is better." This reflects the "living for today" mindset of the *pan-pan* girls and the urban poor after the war.
*   **Predatory Power Dynamics:** Matsui represents the post-war "new rich" (nari-kin) or black marketeers who used money and technology (the projector/erotica) to manipulate young women.
*   **Professional Integrity:** In the second story, Yumi's refusal to ruin the play even while being chased by a predator serves as a contrast to the moral decay in the first story.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp/Kasutori Literature.
*   **Genre:** Melodrama, Erotica (soft), Suspense.
*   **Themes:** Loss of innocence, betrayal, post-war social change, poverty, sexual politics, theater.
*   **Classification:** Adult (due to sexual themes and nudity in illustration).
