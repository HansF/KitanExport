「今度は私の順番なんですか、第二回目の筆頭をうけたまわつて、いささか私には重荷のような氣もするんですがね、さあて、一体何を話しましょうかな。」
　齋藤氏は初老の温顔に微笑をうかべて、人差指でチョイと頰を押えると、深々と安樂椅子に背をもたせかけた。
　東京のとあるビルの地下室、奇談クラブと言えば、知る人ぞ知るあらゆるその道の粋人通人を網羅した、耽綺趣味家が一堂に會し、經驗談やら、幻想めいた述懐をすると言う、いわば敗戰後極度に荒んだ精神的神経を、それにふさわしい題材で慰めようとゆう一種の清涼剤にも似た、罪のない、それでいて罪惡めいたアクセントを持つクラブ——
　それが此の地下室の一部屋にある奇談クラブの正体である。
　しばらく考えていた齋藤氏はやがてグッと身を乗り出した、会員の目は期せずして齋藤氏の口元に注がれる。
「いや、そう期待されても困りますがこれは私の経験談ではなく私の幼友達から聞いた實話ですが。尚斷つておきますが、話の中で私とあるのは、その友人のことです。」
　と斷つておいて、年の割に若やいだ聲でポツ／＼話し始めた。無論、クラブの一員である私も耳を澄ました事は今更断わるまでもない事である。

✕　　✕　　✕

　私は、此れを明らかに殺人罪であると、断言してはばかりません。いやこれは私の想像や推理からだけではなく、立派に科學的な根據があるのです、
　さてお話ししないと何の事かお分りになりますまいが、その前に私が何故、今迄やつていた魚屋をやめて全く場違いの現在の八百屋になつたかと言いますと——。
　私は元来の係累なかつた所へもつてきて、兵隊へ行つている間に、妻を戦災死で失い、全くの独りぽつちになつてしまつたのです。
　在隊當時の友人に佐々木つてのがいましてね、まあ此の男が私の今やつている八百万の先代の主人だつたんですよ。普通軍隊へ入ると誰でも一時的に痩せるんですが、此の男は最初よくまあ兵隊にとられたもんだと思う位、青い顔をしていたんですよ、それで、こりゃ長くはいな、良ければ除隊、悪るければ病死と、こうまあ私達は思つていたんです。
　ところが此の男、不思議な事に、一週間も経つと實に見違えるように血色もよくなり、肥えふとつて元氣が出て来たんですよ。軍隊の荒っぽい訓練や激務の中で、我々も一時は非常に痩せた時期でも、彼はそれどころか、と言う顔で益々太つてくるんですよ、班長からも、佐々木はシヤバで青葉ばかり喰つとつたのかとよく冷やかされる位でした。
　さて入隊してから一箇月位たつたある晩でした。佐々木が夜中に寝言を言つたのを不寝番に聞かれたのです。大抵の者は晝の猛訓練でグッスリ寝ている時に、その凝静まつた部屋の中で言う彼の寝言は
「よし江」
と三回ばかりはっきりと繰り返して言ったそうです。
　翌日、不寝番から洩れ聞いた皆に冷やかされながら、彼が私に語り出した所によると、よし江と言うのは彼の妻なんです、しかも彼もよし江も共に再婚だつたんです。
　よし江は元藝者だつたんで、そこへ一番最初に夫になつた男があらわれて、例によつて例の如くで一緒になつたわけです。
　その男の商賣は八百屋だつたんです。結婚してからのよし江は、水商賣をした女に似合わず真面目で貞淑で、おまけに垢抜けのした美人と來てるでしょう、中々評判がよくて、商賣も繁昌しましたが、結婚後七年目に、一人の子供も作らず、その男は死んでしまつたんです。
　何んでも消化器の病気とかで、青白くやせてフラフラになつていたそうです。
　よし江の悲歎は、はた目も痛々しい位でした。そうでしょう。惚れ合つて夫婦になつて、やつと七年、彼女にしても一番脂の乗る頃ですからね。突然若後家になかつたよし江は、八百屋の商賣にも手がつかず、呆んやりしている所へ、思いがけない夫の生命保険金が千五百圓、手に入りました。
　今の千五百圓なら小遣銭位ですが米一斗十銭もしていなかつた頃のことですから、結構、家の一軒も建ちますよ、その金で彼女は亡夫の志を継いで、八百屋を續けようと、店を改装し、その當時とすれば、随分派手で思い切つた改造をしたものです。

† Strange Tale Club Night 2 †
**The Serial Natural Murders of a Nymphomaniac Beauty**
—— Utsu Taiji ——

"Is it my turn this time? Having been assigned the top spot for the second round, I feel it is somewhat of a heavy burden for me, well now, just what should I talk about."
Mr. Saito, with a smile floating on his elderly gentle face, lightly pressed his cheek with his index finger and leaned his back deeply into the easy chair.
A basement room in a certain building in Tokyo. Speaking of the Strange Tale Club, it is a club for those in the know, covering all kinds of refined people and connoisseurs of that path, where aesthetic hobbyists gather in one hall to tell personal experiences or fantasy-like reminiscences; so to speak, to comfort the mental nerves that were extremely roughened after the defeat in the war with suitable subject matter, a kind of refreshment-like, innocent, yet possessing a guilt-like accent club—
That is the true identity of the Strange Tale Club located in a room of this basement.
Mr. Saito, who had been thinking for a while, eventually leaned forward suddenly. The members' eyes, without planning, were poured onto Mr. Saito's mouth.
"No, even if you expect so much it troubles me, but this is not my own experience but a true story I heard from my childhood friend. Furthermore, I will state in advance, the 'I' in the story refers to that friend."
Having stated that, in a voice youthful for his age, he began to speak bit by bit. Of course, there is no need to mention now that I, as a member of the club, also strained my ears.

✕　　✕　　✕

"I do not hesitate to assert that this is clearly a crime of murder. No, this is not just from my imagination or reasoning, there is a splendid scientific basis.
Now, if I don't tell you, you won't understand what it's about, but before that, as for why I quit the fish shop I was doing until now and became a vegetable shop owner in the current completely out-of-place location...
Coming from a place where I originally had no relatives, while I was away as a soldier, I lost my wife to war death and became completely all alone.
Among my friends during my time in the unit, there was a man named Sasaki, you see. Well, this man was the previous master of the vegetable shop I am running now. Normally when entering the army anyone temporarily loses weight, but this man at first had such a pale face that I thought 'how on earth was he even drafted,' so 'this won't be long; if lucky, discharge, if unlucky, death by disease,' that's what we thought.
However, this man, mysteriously, once a week passed, his complexion became remarkably better, he grew fat and energetic. Amidst the army's rough training and hard work, even at a time when we all lost a lot of weight, he, on the contrary, with such a face, grew fatter and fatter. Even from the squad leader, he was often teased, 'Was Sasaki eating nothing but green leaves in the civilian world?'
Well, it was one night about a month after enlistment. Sasaki was heard talking in his sleep by the night watchman. While most people were sleeping soundly from the day's heavy training, in that quiet room, his sleep-talk was:
'Yoshie.'
He reportedly said it clearly about three times repeatedly.
The next day, while being teased by everyone who heard it leaked from the night watchman, according to what he started telling me, Yoshie is his wife. Furthermore, both he and Yoshie were both remarried.
Yoshie was a former geisha, so the man who first became her husband appeared, and as usual per the usual case, they got together.
That man's business was a vegetable shop. Yoshie after marriage, unlike a woman who had been in the entertainment trade, was serious and chaste, and on top of that, she was a refined beauty, so she had a good reputation and the business prospered, but in the seventh year after marriage, without producing a single child, that man died.
It was supposedly some kind of digestive disease, and he had become pale, thin, and wobbly.
Yoshie's grief was painful even to look at from the side. That's right. Having fallen in love and become a couple, finally seven years. For her too, it was the time when one is in the prime of life. Yoshie, who suddenly became a young widow, couldn't even put her hands to the vegetable business and was idling, when an unexpected life insurance payout of 1,500 yen came into her hands.
1,500 yen now is like pocket money, but in the days when one 'to' (18 liters) of rice didn't even cost 10 sen, it was enough to build a whole house. With that money, she decided to carry on her late husband's legacy and continue the vegetable shop, renovated the shop, and for that time, it was quite a flashy and daring transformation.
Perhaps because of that, customers began to increase bit by bit.
Around that time, there was a person who acted as a matchmaker, and Sasa..."

† The Strange Tale Club: Night Two †
**The Nymphomaniac Beauty’s Serial Natural Murders**
— by Utsu Taiji —

"So, it’s my turn, is it? Being asked to lead off our second gathering feels like a bit of a heavy burden. Now then, what on earth shall I tell you?"
Mr. Saito, a gentleman with a gentle, aging face, wore a faint smile. He pressed a finger to his cheek for a moment before sinking deep into the back of his easy chair.
Our setting: a basement room in a certain Tokyo building. The "Strange Tale Club" is a name known only to the initiated—a gathering place for connoisseurs and aesthetes of every stripe. Here, they meet to share personal anecdotes or recount dreamlike reminiscences. It is a sort of tonic for spirits left jagged and raw by the crushing defeat of the war—a club that offers a refined, innocent, yet slightly wicked distraction through the telling of peculiar tales.
This is the true nature of the club that meets in this subterranean room.
After a moment of silence, Mr. Saito suddenly leaned forward. Every eye in the room was fixed on his lips.
"Now, don't go expecting too much, or I'll be in a bind. This isn't my own experience, but a true story I heard from a childhood friend. I should also clarify that when I say 'I' in the narrative, I am speaking as that friend."
With that disclaimer, he began to speak in a voice that sounded remarkably youthful for his years. It goes without saying that I, like the other members, listened with bated breath.

✕　　✕　　✕

"I wouldn’t hesitate for a moment to call this a case of clear-cut murder. And mind you, this isn't just a matter of my own imagination or deduction; there is a solid scientific basis for it.
Now, you won't understand what I'm talking about unless I give you the background. But before that, let me explain why I quit the fishmonger business I’d been in for years and ended up running this vegetable shop—a trade I knew nothing about.
You see, I never had much in the way of family to begin with, and while I was away at the front, my wife was killed in the air raids. I came home to find myself utterly alone.
Back in the army, I had a friend named Sasaki. As it happens, he was the previous owner of the very vegetable shop I run today. Normally, everyone loses weight when they first join the service, but this man arrived looking so sickly and pale that we wondered how on earth he’d passed the physical. We all figured he wouldn’t last long—either he’d be discharged for ill health or end up in a pine box.
But then, something strange happened. After just a week, his color returned, and he began to fill out. He grew positively robust. Even when the rest of us were wasting away under the grueling drills and harsh labor, he just kept getting fatter. The squad leader used to tease him, asking if he’d been eating nothing but weeds back in the civilian world.
Well, about a month after we enlisted, one of the night sentries caught Sasaki talking in his sleep. While the rest of us were dead to the world after the day’s training, his voice rang out clearly through the silent barracks.
'Yoshie...'
They say he repeated the name three times, plain as day.
The next day, as the story leaked and everyone began to tease him, he opened up to me. Yoshie was his wife, and as it turns out, it was the second marriage for both of them.
Yoshie had been a geisha. Her first husband had come along, and—well, one thing led to another, and they were wed.
That man had been a vegetable seller. Once married, Yoshie turned out to be a surprisingly devoted and chaste wife—which you wouldn't necessarily expect from a woman out of the 'water trade.' On top of that, she was a sophisticated beauty. She had a glowing reputation, and the business thrived. But in their seventh year of marriage, before they could have any children, the man died.
They said it was some sort of digestive ailment. He’d withered away to a pale, wobbling ghost of a man before he finally went.
Yoshie’s grief was so profound it was painful to behold. And why wouldn't it be? They were in love, they’d been together seven years, and she was in the very prime of her womanhood. Suddenly a young widow, she lost all interest in the business and just drifted through her days—until an unexpected windfall arrived: fifteen hundred yen from her husband's life insurance.
Fifteen hundred yen might be pocket change today, but back then, when a bushel of rice cost less than ten sen, you could build a whole house with that kind of money. With those funds, she decided to honor her late husband’s memory and keep the shop going. she renovated the place, giving it a daringly flashy makeover for the time.
Whether it was the new look or something else, customers started trickling back in.
Around that time, someone stepped in to play matchmaker, and Sasa—"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Format:** The page follows a standard three-column vertical layout typical of Japanese magazines of the mid-20th century.
*   **Typography:** The title "淫乱症美人の連続自然殺人" is set in a much larger, bold, stylized font to grab the reader's attention. The author's name is placed centrally under the title.
*   **Frame Story Device:** The text uses a classic frame story. It begins with the narrator describing a "Strange Tale Club" (奇談クラブ) in a basement, creating an atmosphere of mystery and exclusive storytelling. The speaker (Saito) then takes over the narrative, which includes another layer (the story of his friend Sasaki).
*   **Visual Elements:** A small illustration depicts a man (presumably Saito or the narrator) in a Western-style suit sitting at a table with a drink, emphasizing the "club" atmosphere.
*   **Paragraph Markers:** Small "✕" marks are used as section breaks to transition from the introductory frame to the core story.
*   **Period Orthography:** The text uses some *kyūjitai* (older kanji forms) like 氣 (気), 會 (会), and 實 (実), and traditional kana usage like "うけたまわつて" (without the small *tsu*), which was common during the transition period to modern orthography.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** This is from the late 1940s or early 1950s. The mention of "defeat in the war" (敗戦) and "war death" (戦災死) places the story firmly in the post-WWII reconstruction period.
*   **The "Strange Tale Club" (Kidan Club):** This was a real-life magazine specializing in "kasutori" literature—cheaply produced pulp magazines that often featured erotic, grotesque, or mysterious content (*ero-guro-nansensu*).
*   **Economic Context:** The narrator mentions that 1,500 yen was once enough to build a house when rice was 10 sen per "to." This highlights the massive inflation Japan experienced during and immediately after the war.
*   **The "Nymphomaniac" Trope:** The title uses *Inranshō* (淫乱症), a term used in early 20th-century pseudo-psychology to describe "nymphomania." In the context of pulp fiction, this often implied a woman whose sexual appetite literally drained the life out of her husbands (a variation of the *succubus* or *femme fatale* archetype).
*   **Military Context:** The story of Sasaki in the barracks reflects the shared trauma and experience of the Japanese male population who had been drafted. The "night watch" (不寝番) and "squad leader" (班長) are standard military terms.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **粋人 (Suijin) / 通人 (Tsūjin):** Refers to people of refined taste, connoisseurs, or "men about town."
*   **耽綺趣味 (Tanki Shumi):** Aestheticism or a "hobby of seeking the strange/beautiful/grotesque." It implies a decadent interest in the unusual.
*   **清涼剤 (Seiryōzai):** Literally "refreshment" or "tranquilizer." Here used metaphorically for stories that soothe the weary post-war mind.
*   **水商売 (Mizu Shōbai):** The "water trade"—entertainment and nightlife industries (geisha, bars, etc.).
*   **若後家 (Wakagoke):** A young widow.
*   **脂の乗る (Abura no noru):** Literally "getting fatty" (like fish), but idiomatically meaning to be in one's prime or at the peak of one's vitality/beauty.
*   **シャバ (Shaba):** Prison/military slang for the "outside world" or civilian life.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Malaise:** The "Strange Tale Club" is explicitly described as a way to soothe "spirits roughened by defeat." The subtext is that reality was so harsh after the war that people turned to bizarre, erotic, or supernatural fiction as an escape.
*   **The Lethal Female:** The core theme (implied by the title and the death of the first husband) is the "Black Widow" archetype. The beauty of the woman is portrayed as something that "consumes" men, turning them into pale, thin ghosts.
*   **Scientific vs. Supernatural:** The narrator claims there is a "scientific basis" for calling these "natural" deaths "murder." this reflects a common pulp trope where a seemingly supernatural phenomenon is explained through fringe science or psychological obsession.
*   **Transition of Identity:** The narrator switching from a fishmonger to a vegetable seller mirrors the social upheaval of the time, where people had to change professions and lives due to the war.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Pulp Fiction/Kidan)
*   **Genre:** Mystery, Erotic-Grotesque (Ero-Guro), Frame Story, Urban Legend
