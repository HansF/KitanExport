幾日か前の夜の出來事を荒田は憶い出した。とすると今夜の不思議さが解けていく感じだつた。人間一匹の命を奪つた罪意識は、眼前にあの夜の光景をまざまざと画いたのである。

　　　**飯　焚　き　女**

「おいお前等、今度炊事婦に雇われて来た女郎ぁ、なかなか別嬪じやねえか」
「長え一生を棒に振つてもええから、あの女と寝てみてえもんだ。たつた一夜でもええからな」
工事始まつて間もなく、若櫻の町から、色の白い暎涼しい鼻筋通つた二十二才ばかりの、土方相手の炊事婦にはまこと惜しい娘が登つて来たのだつた。
名前をお澄と云い、落折の部落に宿を取り工事場に毎日モンペ姿も甲斐々々しく、花のような匂いを漂わせて通うのであつた。
女体に餓えた土方連が、溜息ついて妖しげな瞳を燃え立たせたのは無理もない。
「ちえつ、俺らがよだれ垂らして手を出す前に、ちやんと頭が控えてらあ」
嫉妬た顔つきを露骨に人夫の一人は自棄つぱちに言い捨てたが、その通り人夫頭の荒田は、誰よりも真つ先に食指を動かしていたのである。
工事場では、荒田が絶対的な勢力を握つていた。彼の上には工務主任がい現場監督の松島がいたが、喧嘩ゴロで前科三犯の罪狀持ちの、荒田の人夫支配力には頭が上らなかつたのだ。
発破でズレた（崩れた）岩石を二十間ばかり離れた岸下迄トロツコで運ぶのだが、トロツコ道は急な坂になつている。
その日――。
「おうい、出るぞう」
トロツコの出発点から声が上がる。
「よつしやあ」停止点から応ずる。
快い一筋の音を響かせてトロツコが下つて来る。
「ストツプ」
が、どうしたわけかブレーキが掛らない。そのまま進めばトロツコ諸共崖下に落下してこなごなになつてしまうのだ。ほん此間一人死んだばかりなのだ。
乗つていた二人は、トロツコがレールを離れる直前飛び降下た。が次の瞬間、高い呻き発して一人の人夫はうつ伏せになつた。
地上に転がつている枕位いの石に胸を打たれたのだ。
その男は呻きながら、しばし動かないでいた。
現場監督も人夫頭も、多勢の人夫に混つて集つて来る。倒れた男は、板に乗せられて工事場近くの休憩小屋に運ばれて行つた。
傷は思つたよりも軽く、脇腹に打撲傷を受けただけだつた。
「なあに、心配することあねえ、明日になにやりゃ癒らあ」
お澄に手伝わせて、手ずから傷の手当を終ると、荒田はそう優しく慰めて、小屋を出て行つた。こういう場合の彼は至極親切だつた。
「大変だつたですね、どう傷は痛みまず？」
お澄は荒田の後姿が外へ消えて行つてから、男の顔をふかぶかと覗き込んで訊くのだつた。
「胸を打つた時は、もう駄目かとも思つたが、大分呼吸をするのが楽になつた」
男は山川と云つて、苦味走つたなかなかいゝ男だつた。生國は山口縣で、年は三十一、勿論獨身で此所へ来る迄四つの工事場を歩いた経歴を持つていた。けれど、そんな経歴に似合わず、性質は至つて穏健で仲間からの気受けはよかつた。他人の嫌がる仕事を彼は黙々とやり、場合によつては自分の方から進んでしたりした。
だがしかし、…………等の誰よりも異性としての立場かいふかく山川に心を寄せていた者があつたのだ。それはお澄であつた。彼女の山川への思慕の情は彼女が山小屋へ登つて来た日、食堂で人夫達が休憩小屋に集まり、中に混つてどこか孤独の憂いといつたものを仄めかしている山川と、顔をチラリと見交した瞬間からだつた。
お澄は胸底で、今日こそは、の思いを高ぶらせる。小屋の中には二人だけだ。絶好の機会でなくて何であろう。誰も見ていない。誰も。時刻は午後三時過ぎ、仕事の終る迄にあと三時間だ。打ち明けようか明けまいか。こんな職業の女には珍らしいお澄の内向型の性格として、煩悶するのは当然だつたが、けれど幾らかの間を置いての後には、とうとう恋情の奔流は堰を切つて流れ出したのである。
「山川さん、私、あんたが好き……」
苦しい心の内を、お澄はそう表現した。
「有難う、俺あ女のひとから好きだと云われたのは初めてだ」
山川は感激を籠めて答えた。好きだと云われて、身内に藏されていた何ものかが燃え上がつたのだ。
「ずつと前から……この山に来た時から、何となく、他人と思えない、気持でした」
お澄は咽喉の奥からこみ上げて来る感傷的な熱いものを、瞳に浮べて男の手を握つた。これだけの会話で、今迄の長かつた悩みは一度に吹つ飛んだ気持のお澄だつた。

　　　**好色の觸手**

それ以来、お澄と山川との仲は、急速に親密になつて行つた。と同時に皮肉な事にけ荒田のお澄に対する言動が次第に露骨を加えて来るのだつた。荒田は、お澄と山川との仲を知らない。口には出さなかつたが二人共、その関係を仲間に知られてはまずいという意識がお互いの秘密を保つていたからだ。
六月の末の或る晩、勘定を貰つた人夫小屋の土方連は、例によつて賭博に耽つていた。荒田はドブ酒に酔つ払つた体を上坐に据えていたが、酔うと好色になり、途中で骰子を捨ててお澄の

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
Several days ago night's incident Arata remembered. Doing so, tonight's strangeness felt like it was dissolving. The guilt of having snatched one human's life vividly painted that night's scene before his eyes.

**The Cook Woman**

"Hey you guys, the harlot hired as a cook this time, isn't she quite a beauty?"
"Even if I throw my whole long life away, I want to try sleeping with that woman. Even just for one night."
Shortly after construction started, from the town of Wakasura, a pale-skinned, cool-nosed girl of about twenty-two years, too good to be a cook for laborers, came up.
Her name was O-sumi; she took lodging in the Ochiori village and every day went to the construction site in her monpe pants gallantly, wafting a flower-like scent.
The group of laborers starved for female flesh, sighing and making their suspicious eyes burn, it was no wonder.
"Cheh, before we can drool and put out a hand, the boss is already waiting at the head."
One laborer spat out with a blatantly jealous face in desperation, but as he said, the laborer boss Arata was moving his "appetite finger" (desire) before anyone else.
At the construction site, Arata held absolute power. Above him were the works chief and the site supervisor Matsushima, but against Arata, a brawler with three prior convictions who controlled the men, they could not hold their heads up.
Blasting-displaced rocks were carried by trolley to the cliff bottom twenty *ken* away, but the trolley path was a steep slope.
That day—.
"Hey, it's going out!"
A voice rises from the trolley starting point.
"Right!" responds from the stop point.
With a pleasant single line of sound echoing, the trolley comes down.
"Stop!"
But, for some reason, the brakes don't catch. If it continues, it will fall off the cliff with the trolley and be smashed to pieces. Just the other day, one person had died.
The two riding jumped off just before the trolley left the rail. But the next moment, emitting a high groan, one laborer fell face down.
He was struck in the chest by a pillow-sized stone rolling on the ground.
That man, while groaning, stayed still for a while.
The site supervisor and the laborer boss, mixed with many laborers, gathered. The fallen man was placed on a board and carried to the rest hut near the construction site.
The wound was lighter than thought, only a bruise on the flank.
"What, nothing to worry about, by tomorrow it'll heal."
Having O-sumi help, and treating the wound with his own hands, Arata comforted him kindly and left the hut. In these cases, he was extremely kind.
"It was terrible, wasn't it? How does the wound hurt?"
O-sumi, after Arata's back vanished outside, peered deeply into the man's face and asked.
"When I hit my chest, I thought it was the end, but breathing has become much easier."
The man's name was Yamakawa, a ruggedly handsome man. His birthplace was Yamaguchi Prefecture, age thirty-one, naturally single, and until coming here he had a history of walking through four construction sites. However, unlike such a history, his nature was extremely mild and he was well-liked by comrades. He did work others hated silently, and depending on the situation, did it of his own accord.
But however... there was someone who, more than anyone else, from the position of the opposite sex, felt deeply for Yamakawa. It was O-sumi. Her affection for Yamakawa began from the moment she came to the mountain hut, when laborers gathered in the dining hall/rest hut, and she glanced at Yamakawa who, mixed among them, hinted at a sort of lonely sorrow.
O-sumi, in the depths of her chest, let the thought of "today is the day" rise. Only the two are in the hut. What could it be if not a golden opportunity? No one is watching. No one. The time is past 3 PM, three hours left until work ends. Should I confess or not? As O-sumi's introverted personality—rare for a woman in this profession—it was natural to agonize, but after a bit of time, finally the torrent of love broke the dam and flowed out.
"Yamakawa-san, I... like you..."
Her painful inner heart, O-sumi expressed thus.
"Thank you. It's the first time I've been told 'I like you' by a woman."
Yamakawa answered with emotion. Being told he was liked, something hidden within him flared up.
"Since a long time ago... since the time I came to this mountain, somehow, I felt you weren't a stranger."
O-sumi, with a sentimental heat welling up from the back of her throat and appearing in her eyes, grasped the man's hand. With just this conversation, O-sumi felt her long-held worries fly away at once.

**Tentacles of Lust**

Since then, the relationship between O-sumi and Yamakawa rapidly became intimate. At the same time, ironically, Arata's words and actions toward O-sumi gradually became more blatant. Arata did not know of the relationship between O-sumi and Yamakawa. Though they didn't speak of it, both had the awareness that it would be bad if the relationship were known by comrades, so they kept each other's secret.
One evening at the end of June, the group of laborers in the hut, having received their pay, were indulging in gambling as usual. Arata sat in the seat of honor, his body drunk on cheap sake, and when drunk he became lecherous; halfway through he threw away the dice and [went to] O-sumi's...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
Arata recalled the events of a few nights ago, and as he did, the strange atmosphere of this evening began to make sense. The guilt of having taken a human life conjured a vivid image of that night’s scene before his very eyes.

**The Cook Woman**

"Hey boys, that harlot they hired as a cook—she's quite a looker, isn't she?"
"I'd throw my whole life away just to spend one night with her. Just one night would be enough."
Not long after the construction project began, a girl had come up from the town of Wakasura. She was fair-skinned with a refined, graceful profile—a girl of about twenty-two who seemed far too precious to be serving as a cook for rough laborers. 
Her name was O-sumi. She stayed in the village of Ochiori and walked to the site every day, appearing gallant in her *monpe* work trousers and trailing a scent as fresh as flowers. It was only natural that the laborers, starved for a woman's touch, watched her with burning, hungry eyes and heavy sighs.
"Tch, before we can even drool over her, the boss has already staked his claim," one laborer spat out, his face twisted with naked jealousy and desperation. He was right; Arata, the labor boss, had set his sights on her before anyone else.
Arata held absolute power at the site. Though there was a works chief and a site supervisor named Matsushima above him, they were no match for Arata—a brawler with three prior convictions who ruled the men with an iron fist.
The job involved hauling blasted rock via trolley to a landing some forty yards away, down a steep, treacherous slope. 
On that particular day—
"Hey! It's coming down!" a voice shouted from the top.
"Ready!" came the reply from below.
The trolley descended with a rhythmic clatter. 
"Stop!"
But for some reason, the brakes failed to catch. If it kept going, it would plunge over the cliff, shattering everything to pieces. Someone had died in just that way only recently. The two men aboard jumped off just before the trolley left the rails. But a moment later, one of them let out a sharp groan and fell face-down. He had been struck in the chest by a stone the size of a pillow. He lay there, groaning, unable to move for a long while.
The supervisor, the boss, and a crowd of laborers rushed to the scene. The fallen man was placed on a plank and carried to the rest hut near the site. Fortunately, the injury was lighter than feared—just a bruised flank.
"It’s nothing to worry about. You’ll be fine by tomorrow," Arata said, comforting him with surprising kindness. He had O-sumi assist him as he personally tended to the man's wounds. In moments like these, Arata could be remarkably decent.
"That was awful. Does it still hurt?" O-sumi asked, leaning in close to peer into the man's face once Arata’s back had disappeared outside.
"When I hit my chest, I thought I was a goner, but I can breathe easier now."
The man was named Yamakawa. He was a rugged, handsome fellow of thirty-one from Yamaguchi Prefecture. He was single, of course, and had spent his life drifting through four different construction projects. Despite this rough background, he was mild-mannered and well-liked by his peers. He would quietly take on the jobs others avoided, often volunteering for the hardest tasks.
But there was someone who saw him as more than just a good worker—someone who felt a deep, womanly yearning for him. It was O-sumi. Her affection for Yamakawa had begun the very day she arrived at the mountain hut, from the moment she caught his eye in the dining hall. Among the crowd of men, Yamakawa had an air of lonely sorrow that had captivated her instantly.
Deep down, O-sumi felt her heart race: *Today is the day.* They were alone in the hut—a golden opportunity. No one was watching. It was just past 3:00 PM, with three hours of work left. She agonized over whether to speak, her introverted nature struggling against her desires. But eventually, the dam burst, and her feelings came rushing out.
"Yamakawa-san... I... I love you..." she whispered, baring her aching heart.
"Thank you," Yamakawa replied, his voice thick with emotion. "That’s the first time a woman has ever said that to me." Hearing those words, something long buried within him caught fire.
"I’ve felt this way for a long time... since I first came to this mountain. I felt like you were someone special to me," O-sumi said, her eyes shimmering with tears as she took his hand. With those few words, the weight of her long-held anxieties vanished.

**Tentacles of Lust**

From that point on, O-sumi and Yamakawa grew rapidly closer. Ironically, Arata’s advances toward O-sumi became increasingly blatant at the same time. Arata knew nothing of their secret; both O-sumi and Yamakawa were acutely aware that if their relationship were discovered, there would be trouble, and so they kept their silence.
One night at the end of June, after the men had been paid, the laborers gathered in the hut to gamble. Arata sat in the place of honor, reeking of cheap sake. Alcohol always brought out his lecherous side. Midway through the game, he tossed aside the dice and headed toward O-sumi’s...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The text is presented in a traditional Japanese vertical (tategaki) layout. It uses a two-column structure common in literary magazines (Bungei magazines) of the Shōwa era.
*   **Typography:** The font is a classic Mincho style. The presence of *kyūjitai* (pre-war kanji forms like 罪狀, 應, 變, 餘) suggests a publication date prior to the full implementation of the 1946 kanji reforms, or a publisher that maintained older orthography into the early 1950s.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   The story titles (**飯焚き女**, **好色の觸手**) are centered and set in a larger, bolder weight to distinguish them from the narrative body.
    *   Dialogue is indicated by traditional corner brackets (「 」).
    *   A page number "( 79 )" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger serial or collection.
*   **Condition:** The paper shows significant aging, with yellowing and some "foxing" (brown spots), typical of cheap "pulp" paper used in post-war Japan.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Setting:** The "construction camp" (hanba) setting is a staple of Japanese Naturalism and Proletarian literature. These sites were often isolated, dangerous, and governed by a strict hierarchy where the "boss" (kashira) held absolute power over the laborers (*dokata* or *ninpu*).
*   **The "Meshi-taki Onna" (Cook Woman):** In the harsh environments of mountain construction or mining, women were hired to cook and clean. Often, these women occupied a precarious social position, sometimes doubling as common-law wives or being subjected to the sexual advances of the men in the camp.
*   **Monpe (モンペ):** These are loose-fitting work trousers traditionally worn by Japanese women. During and immediately after WWII, they became the standard attire for women due to wartime fabric shortages and the need for practical work clothes.
*   **Trocco (トロッコ):** From the English "truck" or "trolley," these were hand-pushed or gravity-fed carts used to move earth and stone. They were notoriously dangerous, a fact referenced in the text and famously depicted in Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's short story "Trocco."
*   **Post-war Hardship:** The mention of gambling, "dobu-roku" (crude unrefined sake), and the drifting nature of the workers (moving from site to site) reflects the itinerant lifestyle of the working class in the early post-war reconstruction era.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **別嬪 (Beppin):** A beautiful woman. Originally a term for "special goods," it evolved into a common term for beauty.
*   **土方 (Dokata):** A construction laborer. In modern Japanese, this is considered a discriminatory term (taboo in broadcasting), but in the context of this era, it was the standard descriptor for the profession.
*   **食指を動かす (Shokushi o ugokasu):** Literally "to move the index finger." It is an idiom meaning to feel a desire for something (originally food, but here applied to sexual desire).
*   **前科三犯 (Zenka san-pan):** Having three prior criminal convictions. This establishes Arata's character as a "brawler" (kenka-goro).
*   **二十間 (Nijū-ken):** A traditional unit of length. One *ken* is approximately 1.81 meters, so 20 *ken* is about 36 meters.
*   **落折 (Ochiori):** A place name, likely fictional or a very small hamlet, emphasizing the remote mountain setting.
*   **好色の觸手 (Kōshoku no Shokushu):** "Tentacles of Lust." The word *shokushu* (tentacle) is used metaphorically to describe the creeping, grasping nature of unwanted sexual advances.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Naturalism:** The text focuses on the raw, often "ugly" realities of human existence—labor, physical danger, lust, and the power dynamics of a closed society.
*   **The "Boss" System:** The character of Arata represents the *oyabun-kobun* (parent-child) power structure of Japanese labor camps. Despite being a "brawler," he shows a paternalistic kindness ("he was extremely kind in these cases"), which makes his eventual predatory behavior more complex.
*   **Isolation and Intimacy:** The romance between O-sumi and Yamakawa is born of shared isolation. O-sumi's "introverted" nature contrasts with the "starved" environment of the men, making her confession a high-stakes act of rebellion against the camp's social order.
*   **Predatory Masculinity:** The laborers are described as "starved for female flesh," and the title of the second section, "Tentacles of Lust," frames male desire as something predatory and invasive.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Naturalism.
*   **Themes:** Labor, Romance, Industrial Accidents, Post-war Japan, Power Dynamics, Lust.
*   **Flags:** Contains archaic/potentially offensive terminology (土方, 女郎), depictions of workplace danger, and themes of sexual harassment/predation.
