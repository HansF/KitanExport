**アパート万華鏡**
**復草京好**

**第一話 慾を言えばハンドバックで**

此のアパートの居住者の中で若し金満家として番付を作れば先ずその筆頭に、吉野さん親子を挙げるのに誰しも躊躇はしないであろう。
戦災で綺麗に家を焼かれ、奥さんを喪い、元の臨時（仮）のアパート住いとは云え、元は島之内に、御殿のような邸宅を構えて心斎橋筋の本店まで、超流線型のキャデラックに乗つて、朝夕通勤されていたと云う、関西屈指の貴金属商なのである。
従つて、親娘二人の住宅居乍ら、其の生活様式たるや、向う三軒両隣りの庶民階級氏とはいささかケタが違うのである。
万事が派手で豪勢を極め、其の職業柄に、燦然たる光彩を放つた観があつた。
況してや、眼の中に入れても痛くない、一粒種の令嬢眞知子さんの日常生活と来たら、推して知るべしである。芳紀正に十九才、これぞ正札付のヴィアージンであろう事は疑う余地もないのであるが、人は裕福になると羨望のあまり、色々とあらぬ趣態をつくもので、口さがたい放送局連中の間では、誰云うとはなく、聖処女眞知子さんを捉えて失礼にも、小野小町だと言いはじめたのである。
勿論小野小町だなんて、讃美の声であろう筈がない。
「お父さま、わたしのことをアパートの人達は、小野小町だつて噂していますわよ」
或る日、眞知子さんは其れとはなく訊ねたものである。
吉野さんはびっくりした。小野小町とは謂うまでもなく、女体の象徴が無い事で、女にとつて、これほど屈辱の烙印はないのだけれど、いくら親娘の間柄であるとはいえ、まさか、ソコまで詮索する訳にもゆかない。
「それは眞知子、お前に教養もあり、美しいと云うので、皆さんが褒めているのだろう」
と、流石に娘の手前、苦しく誤魔化して逃げたものゝ、矢ツ張り気に掛る噂であつた。
無理もない、たつた一人の親娘の情愛として、嫁入前の娘の体に、万一造物の神様が一番肝心なモノをお忘れになつていたとすれば？……。
ところがである。その吉野さんの杞憂を吹き飛ばすに充分なる実に意外な泥棒事件に遭つたのである。泥棒は既にアパートの内情に精通しているらしく、貴金属を狙つて、深夜窓から忍び込んで来たのである。
鍵で目的の金庫を開き、今正に数個の宝石類を鷲掴みにしようとした時、ハツと眼を覚ますや否や、吉野さんは豪気にも組み付いていつた。
「眞知子ッ。早く、早く今の中に宝石を、……」
必死となつて叫ぶ父と怪漢の格闘を目前にしながら、適当な隠し場所と云つて、眞知子さんは咄嗟には機敏な智慧も出てこない。
と、次の瞬間、
「アッ、そうだッ」
ポンと脳裡に閃いた矢庭の智略！流石は賢明な眞知子さんである。ダイヤを、ルビーを、サファイヤを、ものゝ見事な手付で以て、遂に……、が、いかんせん。初夜まで開かぬ秘密のトビラは、時価数十万円の首飾まで、カクノ如し得ないのが当然である。
怪漢は首飾を奪つて逃走した
「眞知子。せめて斯んな時にで」

空氣が存在することによつて人蓄は生きている。その空氣を利用して殺人に用いられるのだから、少々理窟に合わないが、本当だから仕方がない。
先づ頸静脈でも、上膊静脈でもよい、それに注射器によつて、空氣をドシ／＼注入するのである。
どれだけ空氣を注入したら死ぬかは人間で実験した人がいないからわからない。家畜で実験したものは、馬は一五〇〇、CC以上、牛は三〇〇〇CC以上、猫は三〇CC以上、兎は二〇CC以上を注入しなければ死なないと云うのである。
空氣注入による死因は、空氣が血管を栓塞して、肺、脳などの機能を妨げる為とされている。

**第一話 欲を言えばハンドバッグで**

このアパートの居住者の中で、もし金満家として番付を作れば、まずその筆頭に、吉野さん親子を挙げるのに誰も躊躇はしないであろう。
戦災で綺麗に家を焼かれ、奥さんを亡くし、元の臨時（仮）のアパート住まいとはいえ、元は島之内に御殿のような邸宅を構えて心斎橋筋の本店まで、超流線型のキャデラックに乗って、朝夕通勤されていたという、関西屈指の貴金属商なのである。
したがって、父娘二人の住まいながら、その生活様式たるや、向こう三軒両隣の庶民階級とはいささか桁が違うのである。
万事が派手で豪華を極め、その職業柄、燦然たる光彩を放っている感があった。
ましてや、目に入れても痛くない、一人娘の令嬢・真知子さんの日常生活ときたら、推して知るべしである。芳紀まさに十九歳、これぞ正真正銘のバージン（処女）であることは疑う余地もないのであるが、人は裕福になると羨望のあまり、色々とあらぬ噂を立てるもので、口さがない噂好きの連中の間では、誰言うとなく、聖処女・真知子さんを捉えて失礼にも、「小野小町」と言い始めたのである。
もちろん「小野小町」なんて、賛美の声であるはずがない。
「お父さま、私のことをアパートの人たちは、小野小町だって噂していますわよ」
ある日、真知子さんはそれとなく尋ねたものである。
吉野さんはびっくりした。小野小町とは言うまでもなく（伝説的に）女性器がないことで、女性にとって、これほど屈辱的な烙印はないのだけれど、いくら父娘の間柄であるとはいえ、まさかそこまで説明するわけにもいかない。
「それは真知子、お前に教養もあり、美しいというので、皆さんが褒めているのだろう」
と、流石に娘の手前、苦しく誤魔化して逃げたものの、やはり気になる噂であった。
無理もない、たった一人の父娘の情愛として、嫁入り前の娘の体に、万一造物主が一番肝心なものをお忘れになっていたとすれば……？
ところがである。その吉野さんの杞憂を吹き飛ばすに十分すぎる、実に意外な泥棒事件に遭ったのである。泥棒はすでにアパートの内情に精通しているらしく、貴金属を狙って、深夜窓から忍び込んできたのである。
鍵で目的の金庫を開き、今まさに数個の宝石類を鷲掴みにしようとした時、ハッと目を覚ますやいなや、吉野さんは勇猛にも組み付いていった。
「真知子！早く、早く今のうちに宝石を……」
必死となって叫ぶ父と怪漢の格闘を目前にしながら、適当な隠し場所といって、真知子さんは咄嗟には機敏な知恵も出てこない。
と、次の瞬間、
「あっ、そうだ！」
ポンと脳裏に閃いた咄嗟の知略！流石は賢明な真知子さんである。ダイヤを、ルビーを、サファイアを、見事な手つきで、ついに……。だが、いかんせん。初夜まで開かぬ秘密の扉は、時価数十万円のネックレスまで、隠し通すことはできなかった。
怪漢はネックレスを奪って逃走した。

**Apartment Kaleidoscope**
**By Fukusa Kyōkō**

**Episode 1: If I Speak of Greed, with a Handbag**

Among the residents of this apartment, if one were to make a ranking of wealthy people, first at the top of the list, to name the Yoshino parent and child, surely no one would hesitate.
Having had their house burned beautifully in the war disaster, and losing the wife, although living in what was originally a temporary (provisional) apartment, originally they held a palace-like mansion in Shimounouchi and to the main store in Shinsaibashi-suji, riding in an ultra-streamlined Cadillac, they were said to commute morning and evening; they are among Kansai's leading precious metal dealers.
Therefore, despite being a residence for just two, father and daughter, as for their lifestyle, compared to the commoner class of the three houses opposite and two neighbors, the scale is somewhat different.
Everything is flashy and reaches the height of luxury, and due to the nature of the profession, it had the appearance of emitting a brilliant radiance.
Even more so, the daily life of the only child, the young lady Michiko-san, whom they wouldn't mind putting in their eye (spoiled), is something that can be inferred. Her flowering age is exactly nineteen years, and that she is a certified virgin is a matter beyond doubt, but when people become wealthy, out of envy, they create various strange appearances, and among the foul-mouthed "broadcasting station" (gossip) crowd, without anyone knowing who said it, they caught the holy virgin Michiko-san and rudely began to call her "Ono no Komachi."
Of course, "Ono no Komachi" could not possibly be a voice of praise.
"Father, the people of the apartment are whispering that I am Ono no Komachi, you know."
One day, Michiko-san asked that casually.
Mr. Yoshino was startled. "Ono no Komachi" refers, needless to say, to the lack of female anatomy (genitals), and for a woman, there is no brand of disgrace as great as this, but however much they are father and daughter, he certainly could not go as far as to investigate/explain that.
"That is, Michiko, because you have education and are beautiful, everyone is likely praising you."
So, as expected in front of his daughter, although he painfully deceived and escaped, it was a rumor that weighed on his mind after all.
It is no wonder, as a father-daughter affection for an only child, if by any chance for the body of the daughter before marriage, the Creator God had forgotten the most essential thing...?
However, it happened. An unexpected burglary incident occurred which was sufficient to blow away Mr. Yoshino's anxieties. The thief seemed to already be well-versed in the internal affairs of the apartment, and aiming for precious metals, he sneaked in from a window in the middle of the night.
Opening the target safe with a key, just as he was about to grab several gemstones, as soon as he startled awake, Mr. Yoshino courageously went to grapple with him.
"Michiko! Quick, quick, while you can, the jewels..."
While facing the struggle of the father and the mysterious man who were calling out desperately, as for a suitable hiding place, for Michiko-san, clever wisdom did not come out instantly.
And, the next moment,
"Ah, I know!"
An instantaneous stratagem flashed in her mind! As expected of the wise Michiko-san. Diamonds, rubies, sapphires, with a magnificent handling, finally... but, alas. The secret door that does not open until the wedding night, even a necklace worth hundreds of thousands of yen, naturally could not be accommodated like this.
The mysterious man stole the necklace and fled.
"Michiko. If only at a time like this..."

**(Bottom section)**
**Disturbing Stories**
**Five Pieces: Murder Weapon, Air**
Because air exists, humans and livestock live. Using that air for murder, it doesn't quite stand to reason, but since it's true, it can't be helped.
First, the jugular vein or the brachial vein is fine; into that, via a syringe, one injects air rapidly.
How much air must be injected to die, because no one has experimented on humans, it is unknown. Those experimented on livestock: horses are 1500cc or more, cows 3000cc or more, cats 30cc or more, rabbits 20cc or more—it is said they won't die unless that much is injected.
The cause of death by air injection is said to be the air embolizing the blood vessels and obstructing the functions of the lungs, brain, etc.

**The Apartment Kaleidoscope**
**By Kyōkō Fukusa**

**Episode 1: Greed and the Handbag**

If one were to rank the residents of this apartment building by wealth, the Yoshino family would undoubtedly sit at the very top. Though the war had reduced their grand Shimounouchi mansion to ashes and claimed the life of Mr. Yoshino’s wife, forcing them into this "temporary" apartment, they remained one of the most prominent jewelers in the Kansai region. It was said that Mr. Yoshino still commuted daily to his main store in Shinsaibashi in an ultra-modern, streamlined Cadillac. 

Consequently, though it was a home for only a father and daughter, their lifestyle was leagues above the commoners living in the surrounding units. Everything about them was extravagant, and perhaps owing to their trade, they seemed to radiate a certain brilliant luster. 

This was doubly true for their only daughter, the cherished Michiko. At nineteen, she was in the bloom of youth—a certified virgin beyond a shadow of a doubt. Yet, wealth often breeds envy, and the gossips of the building—those "human broadcasting stations"—began to refer to the "Saintly Michiko" by the nickname "Ono no Komachi."

To the uninformed, this might sound like a compliment to her beauty, but in the crude slang of the era, it was anything but. 
"Father," Michiko asked casually one day, "the neighbors are whispering that I’m an 'Ono no Komachi.' Why is that?"
Mr. Yoshino was aghast. The nickname was a cruel euphemism for a woman born without genitals—perhaps the ultimate insult to a young woman’s femininity. He could hardly explain such a vulgar thing to his own daughter.
"Well, Michiko," he stammered, making a desperate escape from the truth, "it’s surely because you are so refined and beautiful that they compare you to the legendary poetess."
Though he managed to deflect her question, the rumor gnawed at him. He couldn't help but worry, in a fit of paternal anxiety: what if the Creator really *had* forgotten the most essential part of his daughter’s anatomy before she went off to be married?

Resolution came from a most unexpected quarter: a burglary. A thief, evidently familiar with the building’s layout, slipped through the window at midnight, intent on the family’s stash of jewels. He had just cracked the safe and was about to seize a handful of gems when Mr. Yoshino awoke and courageously tackled the intruder.
"Michiko! Quick!" he roared while struggling. "Hide the jewels while you can!"
Michiko watched the desperate struggle, her mind racing for a hiding spot. Then, in a flash of inspiration, she had it! With the grace of a master, she swept up the diamonds, rubies, and sapphires... and attempted to hide them in the "secret door" that was supposed to remain closed until her wedding night. Alas, nature proved the gossips wrong in the most inconvenient way: the "door" was indeed quite functional, but it wasn't nearly large enough to accommodate a necklace worth hundreds of thousands of yen. 
The thief snatched the necklace and vanished into the night.
"Michiko," her father groaned, "if only you’d proven them wrong at a different time..."

**Grim Tales: The Air Weapon**
We owe our lives to the air we breathe. It seems a contradiction, then, that air can be turned into a tool for murder—yet it is a cold, hard fact. 
By injecting air directly into the jugular or brachial vein with a syringe, one can induce death. While no human trials exist to confirm the exact lethal dose, animal experiments show that a horse requires 1,500cc, a cow 3000cc, a cat 30cc, and a rabbit 20cc. Death occurs when the air forms an embolism, blocking blood flow to the lungs and brain.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into three main vertical columns of narrative text. There is a decorative header for the main series and a separate, boxed-off section at the bottom right for a "sidebar" style column called "Busouna Hanashi" (Disturbing/Grim Stories).
*   **Typography:** The main title "アパート万華鏡" (Apartment Kaleidoscope) is written in a stylized, hand-drawn font typical of mid-century magazines. The body text uses standard vertical Japanese typesetting with *furigana* (ruby characters) to assist with difficult kanji or to provide specific readings (e.g., providing "virgin" for the word *shojo*).
*   **Visual Elements:** Small, whimsical illustrations are interspersed within the text. There is a profile of a young woman (presumably Michiko) and a hand holding a small object. These illustrations provide a "light novel" or "manga-magazine" feel.
*   **Formatting:** Paragraphs are indented. The use of double-angle brackets for dialogue is standard. The "Grim Stories" section is physically separated from the main narrative by a dashed line/border, indicating it is a recurring factual or "did you know" column rather than part of the fiction.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Reconstruction:** References to "houses burned in the war" and living in "temporary apartments" place the story firmly in the post-WWII era (1945–1955). The contrast between the father's former wealth in Shimounouchi (an old merchant district in Osaka) and his current apartment living highlights the social shifts of the time.
*   **The Cadillac:** The mention of a "streamlined Cadillac" serves as a potent symbol of American influence and extreme wealth during the occupation and early recovery period.
*   **Ono no Komachi Slang:** Historically, Ono no Komachi was a famous Heian-period poet and beauty. However, in the Edo and early modern periods, her name became a cruel slang term for a woman with "vaginal atresia" (born without a vaginal opening), based on a folk legend. This pun/insult is central to the story's "humorous" twist.
*   **Medical Urban Legends:** The "Air Embolism" story was a popular trope in post-war detective fiction and "true crime" magazines. It reflects a public fascination with scientific/forensic "tricks" for murder.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Social Class and Envy:** The story explores the friction between the "nouveau riche" (represented by the Cadillac-driving jeweler) and the "commoner class" living in the same apartment building.
*   **Purity vs. Scandal:** The central joke hinges on the "Saintly Michiko's" virginity. The subtext plays with the era's obsession with female chastity while introducing a ribald, almost "rakugo-style" punchline.
*   **The "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" Legacy:** The combination of a slightly sexual joke (the Ono no Komachi reference) and the macabre "Murder by Air" sidebar is a late manifestation of the *Ero Guro Nansensu* (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense) movement that was popular in pre-war Japan and saw a resurgence in pulp magazines post-war.
*   **Materialism:** The frantic attempt to hide "hundreds of thousands of yen" in jewelry reflects the economic anxieties and the value placed on portable wealth during the unstable post-war years.
