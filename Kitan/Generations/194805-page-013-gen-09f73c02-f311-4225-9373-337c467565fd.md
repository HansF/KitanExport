## 69's Witty Remarks (676)

Even though we are called "birds of a feather" couple, regarding the matter between the Eiko couple, the existence of a perfectly white child, like an egg, is a seed of mystery for me.
One time, meeting with Eiko-san and having idle chatter, the conversation reached that topic.
"Isn't there some secret?" I asked her.
Then, Eiko-san smiled faintly/slyly,
"It's not something you'd call a secret, but—" she said, obscuring her words and making me wait.
"What is it? It's fine if you tell me."
"Do you know 'Sixty-Nine'?"
"The Arabic numeral 69?"
"And what relation does that have with the secret?"
"I can't say such a thing from my mouth. You should ask your husband about it."
"Does my person (husband) know such a thing, I wonder?"
"If he were a man, he should generally know it."
Since I couldn't pursue Eiko-san any further, that night, I asked my husband, just as Eiko-san had instructed.
Then my husband gave a strange knowing smile,
"You know it, so what are you going to do? If it's a desire, I can teach you, but," he said, which was again a way of talking that included a hidden meaning for a wife.
"I want to know about that strange thing. Apparently, there's a relation between that 69 and the birth of a white child."
"In the case of the Eiko couple, isn't it just that a bird's offspring came from a bird?"

When I said this, my husband looked thoughtful for a moment, but
He couldn't bear to look directly at me, easing his cheeks, and stayed silent.
"Probably, in my opinion, sucking in the man's thing seems to relate to the skin color of the child born. I don't want you to have such a dark-skinned child, and I haven't done it to give birth to a white child either, but if you say you want a white child, maybe I need to reconsider."
"No! Don't say such things, and you are trying to gauge my expression again."
"Hey, when will you say it? That kind of

At that point, I, having been ignorant,
wanted him to explain it thoroughly so I could understand.
Then my husband asked sarcastically,
"Well? Do you understand the meaning of Sixty-Nine now—?"
Having been told that far, I became angry at my own helpless attitude. I just

After getting into bed, my husband [initiated sexual contact] with me.
"No! That kind of thing—"
"Huh? Well, whenever [unknown]."
My whole body was prickling,
And [I] shrank my eyes/pupils.
"No, no [unknown]!"
Then, that night, I was finally forced to experience the Sixty-Nine.
Immediately, two or three days later, meeting Eiko-san, I asked her this:
"You didn't do anything for me, you awful person. Don't you know!"

## The Witty Remark of 69 (Story 676)

Though we consider ourselves a compatible couple, the matter concerning the Eiko household—the mystery of how they produced a child as purely white as an egg—has always puzzled me.
One day, I met Eiko, and after exchanging some harmless gossip, the subject came up.
"Is there perhaps some secret to it?" I pressed her.
Eiko-san gave a sly, knowing smile.
"It's not exactly what you'd call a secret, but..." she teased, obscuring her meaning and drawing out the suspense.
"Come on, what is it? Just tell me."
"Do you know 'Sixty-Nine'?"
"The Arabic numeral 69?"
"And what exactly is the relationship between that and your secret?"
"I can't possibly say it myself. You should ask your own husband."
"I wonder if my husband knows such a thing?"
"If he's a man, he should know, generally."
Unable to press Eiko further, that night I questioned my husband, just as she had instructed.
My husband responded with a peculiar, knowing chuckle.
"So you know it now? What are you planning to do? If you desire it, I could teach you," he said, again using that manner of speaking meant to be provocative to a wife.
"I want to know the meaning of that strange thing. Apparently, there's a connection between that 'Sixty-Nine' and the birth of a fair-skinned child."
"In the case of the Eiko couple, isn't it just a matter of a bird begetting a bird's chick?"

When I said this, my husband looked reflective for a moment, but he couldn't hold my gaze. He relaxed his cheeks and remained silent.
"In my opinion, I suspect that sucking in the man's [member] influences the skin color of the child born. I certainly don't wish for you to bear a dark-skinned child, and I haven't tried to conceive a white child either, but if you express a desire for a fair child, perhaps I should reconsider."
"No! Don't talk like that. You're just trying to read my reaction again."
"Now, when will you say it? That kind of—"
[... text damage/repetition ...]
I was completely clueless, so I
wanted him to explain it clearly until I fully understood.
Then my husband asked, with a tone of mockery,
"Well? Do you understand the meaning of the Sixty-Nine now—?"
Being pushed that far, I felt indignation rising at my own helpless ignorance. I just
[... end of column ...]

After we got into bed, my husband imposed [the act] on me.
"No! Not that way—"
"What? Well, whenever [you want]."
My entire body felt tingly,
And my eyes narrowed tightly.
"No, absolutely not!"
That night, I was ultimately forced to experience the Sixty-Nine.
A few days later, I quickly went to see Eiko-san and challenged her:
"You didn't do anything for me, you cruel woman! Didn't you know about this?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is presented in a traditional Japanese vertical (Tategaki) layout, reading from right to left, and top to bottom.

**Structure and Layout:**
1.  **Title/Header:** A large, distinctive decorative cartouche dominates the top right section. It contains the large numeral **69** surrounded by a thick, dark oval border. Above it, the smaller number **676** is positioned, possibly indicating the story or episode number. Below the oval is the title **の 諧言** (No Kaigen). This structure visually highlights the core, scandalous topic (69) of the narrative.
2.  **Column Structure:** The main body text is divided into thin vertical columns. The columns are relatively tight, indicating dense prose.
3.  **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of standard Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana. The font is Minchō style, characteristic of pre-war and mid-Shōwa publications. Furigana (small phonetic annotations) are not widely used, suggesting the target audience had an intermediate to advanced reading level.
4.  **Formatting Elements:** Dialogue is marked using the traditional Japanese bracket system (「」). Repetition marks (like 々, or the doubled iteration mark for kana, e.g., ニヤ／＼ for *niyaniya*) are used, though some are transcribed as diagonal slashes (／＼) in the image, common in older typography.
5.  **Damage/Corruption:** The most notable structural feature is the extreme text degradation/repetition/overlap in the central columns (columns 2 and 3), particularly in the description of the argument and the sexual encounter. This suggests poor printing quality, heavy editing, or deterioration of the source material.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Era and Publication:** The combination of vertical script, use of historical kana usage (e.g., ゐる instead of いる, を instead of お), and the thematic focus strongly suggests this text belongs to the **mid-Shōwa era** (circa 1940s–1960s). This period saw a rise in *ero-guro nansensu* (erotic, grotesque, nonsense) literature, often published in small magazines or privately printed collections, especially during the post-war relaxation of censorship.

**Themes of Race and Reproduction:** The central premise—that a specific sexual act (69) relates to the skin color of the offspring (wanting a "white child")—is a highly specific and bizarre cultural trope, blending sexual novelty with pseudo-eugenics or superstition about reproduction. While clearly medically inaccurate, the idea reflects contemporary anxieties or obsessions regarding racial purity and whiteness (especially in post-war Japan influenced by Western beauty standards). The term "色白の児" (white/fair-skinned child) is heavily emphasized.

**Sexual Knowledge (69):** The number "69" is used both as an Arabic numeral and a euphemism for the act of mutual oral sex. The narrator's initial ignorance ("The Arabic numeral 69?") followed by her husband's knowing smirk highlights the social boundary between the perceived "innocent" wife and the "worldly" husband (or the general male sphere of knowledge) regarding non-procreative sexual acts. The phrase "諧言" (Kaigen, witty/scandalous remark) used in the title confirms the content is meant to be shocking or humorous in a transgressive way.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

| Japanese Term | Transcription/Context | Meaning/Usage | Modern Equivalent/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 諧言 | カイゲン (Kaigen) | Witty remark; playful speech; often implies scandal or risqué humor. | A somewhat archaic literary term for bawdy or clever speech. |
| 透き通った白色の児 | Sukitōtta shiroiro no ko | A child of translucent white color. | Emphasizes extreme paleness or fairness; almost unnaturally white. |
| ニヤ／＼ | Niyaniya | Slyly smiling, knowing grin. | Usually written ニヤニヤ. Indicates a hidden, often malicious or suggestive, pleasure. |
| 秘訣 | Hiketsu | Secret, key, tip (for success). | Used here euphemistically to refer to a secret sexual practice related to the desired outcome. |
| アビア数 | Abia-sū | Arabic numeral. | Refers to the numerical system (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) to distinguish 69 from other meanings, though here it refers specifically to the numeral shape. |
| 御主人 | Goshujin | Husband (polite, used by the wife of the person being addressed). | Standard polite term for "your husband." |
| 禽の子 | Tori no ko / Kin no ko | A bird's offspring/chick. | Used metaphorically to suggest that the white child is "just what you would expect" from the Eiko couple, possibly implying they are somehow inherently "white" or simple. |
| 蒙昧 | Mōmai | Ignorance; illiteracy; lack of understanding. | The narrator uses this self-deprecatingly when she realizes she needs the explicit explanation of 69. |
| 堪えない | Taenai | Cannot bear/endure. | Used in the phrase "正視してゐるに堪えない" (cannot bear to look directly). |
| 追究 | Tsuikyū | To pursue; to investigate thoroughly. | Used by the narrator when she says she couldn't press Eiko-san any further. |

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**Sexual Education and Ignorance:** The primary tension revolves around the narrator's forced confrontation with a sexual practice she did not know (69). Her initial ignorance (Mōmai) and subsequent reluctance are set against her husband's smug, sarcastic delivery of this "knowledge." This highlights the gendered division of sexual knowledge in the era, where men possessed hidden sexual lore, and respectable women were expected to remain ignorant until instructed by their husbands.

**Power Dynamics and Coercion:** The husband uses the information (the supposed secret to having a white child) and the narrator's lack of understanding as a tool of control and manipulation. His teasing dialogue ("What are you going to do?") and the eventual coercive initiation of the act ("私はその夜、とうとう六十九の体験をさせられてしまつた," "I was finally forced to experience the 69") reveal a clear subtext of marital power imbalance and sexual coercion. The narrator's final indignant complaint to Eiko shows she feels betrayed by both her friend and her husband.

**Superstition and Desire for Whiteness:** The pseudo-eugenic belief linking a specific oral act (sucking in the male member) to the child's skin color serves as the *mechanism* for the plot. This theme underscores a deeper societal anxiety or desire for Westernized aesthetics ("white child"), driving the narrator's initial curiosity and the husband's rhetorical leverage.

**Tone:** The tone shifts from gossipy and curious (when speaking with Eiko) to tense, humiliating, and ultimately indignant (when dealing with her husband). The overall mood is transgressive and slightly uncomfortable, fitting the *ero-guro* classification.
