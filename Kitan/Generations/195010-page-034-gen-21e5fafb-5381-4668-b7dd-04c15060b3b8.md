## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Two people. In a dirt floor area of about two tsubo, high chairs in a stand-style are arranged.
"Welcome, what shall [I] make [for you]?" 
By the Osaka dialect of the Madam who looked about 27 or 28 smiling brightly, [I] felt relieved and 
"Let's see, one bottle of hot [sake], and then some kind of light appetizer..." 
[I] ordered.
The back of the stand had become a kitchen, and suddenly a cook of 25 or 26 in a white kappōgi apron, while humming a song, received the Madam's order with:
"Right-o, understood."
The previous guest was one person, a salaryman-like person of about the same age as me, quietly sipping cup-sake and picking at Asakusa nori appetizer. Apparently, this is a "Pure Japanese" shop of my desire?
After a while, making the ladder-stairs behind the bartender creak-creak, a girl came down. Lips bright red as if she had eaten strawberries, heavy greasepaint makeup, she is unmistakably a Pan-pan [girl].
"Older sister, thanks..." 
She greeted and went outside like the wind.
Following that, with thud-thud sounds, a quite drunk man came down the ladder-stairs. Immediately the Madam 
"How was it? She was a good girl, wasn't she?"
called out while warming the sake. Whether the man heard that voice or not, making his face bright red and flushed with alcohol look drowsy, he went out staggering like a sleepwalker.
The path of a snake is known to snakes; immediately something resonated 'ping' in my sixth sense.
"Madam, there's a special room, isn't there? Can I go up?"
When I said it like a joke, the Madam, as if startled, silently stared at my face as if to bore holes in it. From the small window of the kitchen, the cook also stared at me with scary eyes.
"Hahaha, no need to worry, I'm not a detective, and I haven't come to investigate from the tax office either."
"...Is that really true? Because lately, they occasionally come to investigate with a 'don't-know' face."
"How about it, won't you let me play by the hour?"
"What about a companion?"
"I'll leave it to you, Madam, so please handle it well..."
"...Well then, please [come in]."
When the Madam gave a quick wink, from between the two [women], the waitress with the worse complexion stood up holding my spring overcoat and bag.
"It's a steep ladder-stairs, so your footing is dangerous-masse..."
And, she also comes up behind me. When I tried going up, I was surprised. Seeing from the outside, it is hidden exactly by the sign, but the attic was skillfully remodeled, two three-tatami rooms were made, in a corner rayon bedding was piled up, and a suggestive dressing table and small desk were also placed. On the walls were plywood, and for covering holes, still photos of movie actors etc. were pasted all over.
"That side is Madam's room, this side is our room-nen..."
"If so, do the three of you sleep [there] at night? The security must be bad..."
"Master is mean, saying that kind of thing, look... it's because there's trouble when the police come to investigate-massharō."
The waitress, when seen face-to-face under the light, is a cute girl with round eyes like Setsuko Wakayama. With this girl, I would have no complaints. I, putting my hand on her shoulder, pulled her close firmly. Then,
"...It's different, I'm going to call [someone] now, so please wait a little. About a kiss is okay, though."
she said, giggling.
"Eh? I intended [it to be] you."
"...Normally it would be okay, but I am in the middle of 'that' [menstruation] right now. The other girl is slightly injured, so she can't take customers."
"...Rather, how about that Madam?"
"Ufufu, Madam is no good, because the Master is in the kitchen... ..."
Ah, I see! The cook was a "Young Swallow" [toy boy], then.
"When you say you'll call someone, are there girls nearby? How much for coming?"
"It's five hundred yen by the hour, even for us it's the same. ...Well, if it's about this time, everyone probably caught a customer, so I wonder if a good girl is left?"
"...She'll be a Japanese girl, right?"
"Don't be silly, decent girls at this time of day are all sold out..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Just two of us. In a tiny dirt-floor space of about six square meters, a few high, bar-style stools were lined up. 

"Welcome! What can I get for you?" 

The proprietress, a woman who looked to be in her late twenties, greeted me with a bright smile. Her warm Osaka accent put me at ease immediately. 

"Let’s see... give me a bottle of the hot sake, and whatever light appetizer you have ready," I ordered. 

The back of the counter served as a kitchen. A young cook, perhaps twenty-five or six, dressed in a crisp white *kappōgi* apron, began humming a tune as he acknowledged the order. "Right away, sir!"

The only other customer was a man about my age, likely an office worker. He sat quietly, sipping from a glass of sake and nibbling on a side of Asakusa seaweed. This seemed to be exactly the kind of unpretentious, "pure Japanese" establishment I had been looking for.

After a moment, the sound of heavy creaking came from a ladder hidden behind the bar. A young woman descended. With her lips painted a vivid strawberry red and a thick layer of greasepaint makeup, she was unmistakably a "Pan-pan" girl. 

"Thanks, sis..." she muttered as she slipped out the door like a gust of wind.

Almost immediately, a heavily intoxicated man came thudding down the same ladder. The Madam didn't miss a beat. 

"Well? She was a lovely girl, wasn't she?" she chirped while warming my sake. 

The man, his face a deep, drunken crimson, seemed not to hear her. Looking dazed and vacant, he staggered out of the shop like a sleepwalker. 

It takes a thief to know a thief—or in this case, a regular to know a den of vice. My sixth sense flared.

"Madam," I whispered, "you've got a 'special room' upstairs, don't you? Think I could go up?"

I said it as a joke, but the Madam froze. She stared at me with such intensity it felt like she was trying to bore holes through my skull. From the small kitchen window, the cook also glared at me with a menacing look.

"Haha, relax. I’m not a detective, and I’m certainly not here from the tax office to audit you."

"...You're sure about that? These days they come poking around pretending they don't know a thing."

"Come on, can't I stay for an hour or so?"

"And your companion?"

"I'll leave the choice to you, Madam. I trust your judgment."

"...Alright then, follow me."

The Madam gave a sharp wink, and one of the two waitresses—the one with the sickly complexion—stood up, grabbing my light spring coat and bag. 

"Mind your step, the ladder is quite steep," she warned as she led the way up.

What I found upstairs was a surprise. From the street, the attic was completely obscured by the shop’s large signage. The space had been cleverly converted into two tiny rooms, each about the size of three tatami mats. Rayon bedding was piled in a corner, alongside a small, gaudy dressing table and a desk. The walls were nothing but thin plywood, plastered with movie star headshots to cover up the holes.

"That side is the Madam's room. This is where we stay," she explained.

"The three of you sleep here? That seems a bit... insecure."

"Master, don't be so mean. If we didn't live like this, it would be difficult when the police come snooping around, wouldn't it?"

In the direct light, I realized the waitress was actually quite a pretty girl, with large, round eyes reminiscent of the actress Setsuko Wakayama. I wouldn't have minded her at all. I reached out, put my hand on her shoulder, and pulled her toward me. 

She giggled and pushed back gently. "Oh, no, sir. I'm just here to go find someone for you. Just wait a minute. I don't mind a kiss, though."

"Eh? I thought it was going to be you."

"Usually, I'd be happy to, but it's 'that time' of the month for me right now. And the other girl is nursing an injury, so she can't take customers either."

"In that case... how about the Madam?"

"Hehe, the Madam is off-limits. Her 'husband' is right down there in the kitchen..."

Ah, of course! So the young cook was her "young swallow"—her kept man.

"You say you're going to call someone? Are there girls nearby? And what's the rate?"

"Five hundred yen an hour. It’s the same for all of us. But at this hour, most of the girls have probably already found customers. I’m not sure who’s left."

"They're Japanese girls, right?"

"Don't be ridiculous. Any 'decent' girls are long since sold out by this time of night..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The text is presented in a classic mid-20th-century magazine format. It uses vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*) across two columns. 
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style typical of post-war printing. It uses *kyū-kanazukai* (historical kana usage), though some modernizations (like small *tsu* for geminates) are present, suggesting a transitional period (late 1940s to early 1950s).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is likely on the previous page or at the very top (not fully visible). The page number "( 34 )" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Illustration:** A simple line drawing (signed "玲子" or Reiko) occupies the top right. It depicts a woman with a Western-influenced hairstyle and fashion typical of the late 1940s/early 1950s, looking over her shoulder with a coy expression.
*   **Dialogue Markers:** Uses traditional Japanese quotation marks 「 」 for dialogue. The Osaka dialect is rendered phonetically to preserve its melodic quality.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War "Kasutori" Era:** This text likely comes from a "Kasutori magazine" (*Kasutori-zasshi*). These were cheap, pulp magazines popular in the 3–5 years after WWII, known for their mix of detective stories, erotica, and social commentary. The name "Kasutori" comes from a cheap dreg-liquor; it was said the magazines (like the liquor) would make you sick after three "cups" (issues).
*   **Pan-pan Girls:** The term "pan-pan" (パンパン) refers to street prostitutes who primarily serviced the Occupation forces (and later locals) in post-war Japan. They were recognizable by their heavy Western-style makeup (Doran/greasepaint) and flashy clothes.
*   **Aka-sen/Ao-sen:** The setting is likely a "Blue Line" (*Ao-sen*) district—areas where bars and restaurants secretly doubled as brothels, unlike the "Red Line" (*Aka-sen*) districts where prostitution was semi-legalized but regulated.
*   **Osaka Dialect (Kamigata-ben):** The Madam's use of "Oideyasu" and "Oまっせ" highlights the setting (Osaka) and the merchant/service class culture of the region.
*   **The "Young Swallow" (Waka-tsubame):** This term refers to a younger male lover kept by an older woman. The protagonist realizes the cook is not just an employee but the Madam's partner.
*   **Economic Context:** The price of "500 yen an hour" reflects the inflation of the post-war period. In the late 1940s, this was a significant amount but within the reach of a "salaryman" looking for a night out.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **二坪 (Ni-tsubo):** A measurement of area. One tsubo is about 3.3 square meters (two tatami mats). Two tsubo (approx. 6.6 sqm) is incredibly cramped for a bar.
*   **割烹衣 (Kappōgi):** A traditional long-sleeved apron worn over a kimono or clothes to protect them while cooking.
*   **突き出し (Tsukidashi):** An automatic appetizer served with the first drink, similar to *otoshi*.
*   **ドーラン (Dōran):** Greasepaint makeup, originally for theater, but adopted by post-war street girls for its heavy coverage.
*   **刑事 (Keiji) vs. 税務署 (Zeimushō):** The Madam is afraid of both the police (anti-prostitution laws) and the tax office (unreported income), which shows the illegal/underground nature of her business.
*   **人絹 (Jinken):** Short for *jinzō kinu* (artificial silk), i.e., rayon. It was a common substitute for silk in the era of shortages.
*   **スチール (Suchīru):** "Still" photos. Publicity shots for movies.
*   **若山セツ子 (Wakayama Setsuko):** A popular Japanese film actress of the late 40s and 50s, known for her "doe-eyed" look.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Desperation and Survival:** The story depicts the gritty reality of post-war survival. The bar is a "Pure Japanese" front for illegal prostitution.
*   **Eroticism vs. Mundanity:** The sexual nature of the business is handled with a mix of humor and matter-of-factness. The waitress isn't "available" because of a biological reality (menstruation), breaking the romanticized fantasy of the brothel.
*   **Class and Social Strata:** The interaction between the "salaryman" narrator and the working-class bar staff highlights the social ecosystem of the post-war urban landscape.
*   **The "Front" (Omote) and the "Behind" (Ura):** The physical layout—a tiny bar with a hidden staircase to an attic—serves as a metaphor for Japanese society at the time: a respectable front hiding a desperate, illicit reality.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Literature.
*   **Genre:** *Fūzoku* (Social Manners/Erotica), Realism.
*   **Themes:** Prostitution, Post-war Japan, Urban Life, Romance, Poverty, Osaka Dialect.
*   **Flags:** Contains references to prostitution, sexual situations (implied), and period-typical slang.
