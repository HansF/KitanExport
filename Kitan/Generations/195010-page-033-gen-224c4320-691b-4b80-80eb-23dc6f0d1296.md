## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

It is the situation. Having been separated from my wife for five nights already, because I stood next to the fluffy rubber-ball-like body of a young girl, I am increasingly excited and it seems a nosebleed might come out. When I turned east beside the Sonezaki Police Station, I divided the shop-curtain of a drink-shop lined up smoothly and thrust my head in.

**2. Substitute Pansuke**
Muttering idly, poking at oden and mixing beer and shochu for about an hour.
"Older brother, it is the bill."
"Hey, uh..."
"Two beers, three shochus, oden was... ten skewers, in total, 465 yen."
"Alright, the change is a tip."
The gloom of working at a cheap-paying company that pays a 12,000 yen salary divided into three times a month went somewhere; tearing the salary bag in my pocket with a 'piri', five 100-yen bills that seemed sharp enough to cut hands.
I leave the stall aimlessly. On a lukewarm autumn night, neon lights flicker 'chika-chika', and because alcohol is burning inside my belly, "bring on arrows or guns," I stretched both hands 'u-i' and took a deep breath, and the annoying section manager's face and the hated document work vanished all at once.
"Wait, wait... big brother, please play [with me]."
A woman who slid up smoothly like a ghost whispered hotly over my shoulder. Expecting a perm and bright red lips, I spun around, and then? I was shocked. A shabby fifteen-six-year-old girl with a bob cut and short worn-out clogs. As she grinned bashfully, I was somewhat flustered, 
"Hmm, is it you? Who takes customers?"
when I lowered my voice...
"...If the customer doesn't mind,"
she said, about to fade away. Forestalling my desire to say "You've got to be joking, no matter what...",
"Because my big sister is sick, really my sister was supposed to come, but..."
she sniffled her nose 'kusun'.
"How much? The price,"
when I teased her, she said seriously,
"Don't you know? 500 yen for an hour, 1000 yen for a stay..."
I, suppressing the urge to burst out 'pu' from the bottom of my belly, 
"...You'll probably fail to get a customer anyway, I'll give you good luck,"
once I opened the seal, money for idle play that flows like a river, I pulled out two 100-yen bills 'sutto' and 
"...Go home and buy some sweets. And, to your sister, it's a bit expensive but tell her to get three shots of penicillin."
"Even so, is it okay to just receive it for free?"
she came following me.
"It's fine, it's fine, don't worry, it's fine. Just say a drunk uncle gave it to you."
While moving away quickly from that substitute pan-pan, suddenly, 'jiin', hot tears blurred and fogged my glasses. It's okay to be deceived, closing my eyes, at times like this one should be deceived... Is this what they call 'Sentimental Buddha-heart'? Foolish me!

**3. Princess of the Attic**
9:00 PM. Shops closing their large doors gradually increased. Pedestrian traffic is increasingly thin. This time, from in front of Osaka Station toward the south, if I go around the former site of the Repatriation Support Hall, it is the world-famous Umeda Free Market. With an autumn night's mischievous heart, helped by the alcohol feeling, the women beckoning from the wide-open doorways of the barrack bars lined up in a row look very beautiful.
This whole area is said to be a nest of people with strange accents for Japanese [referring to non-Japanese residents]. If you accidentally wander into a strange shop and tease a woman, immediately rough men from the neighborhood come thumping in, take the customer outside, and while doing things like hitting and kicking and beating him half to death, they apparently strip him of his clothes and all his money.
Because there are those among my friends who met this disaster, I say "fear is fear," but once...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

That’s how it was. Five nights after separating from my wife, the mere sight of a young girl's supple, rubber-ball-like body was enough to get my blood pumping so hard I thought I’d have a nosebleed. As I rounded the corner by the Sonezaki Police Station and headed east, I ducked under the curtain of one of the many dive bars lined up there.

**2. The Substitute Prostitute**
I spent about an hour idly nursing my drinks, picking at oden and mixing beer with shochu.
"Sir, your check," the server said.
"Right, let’s see..."
"Two beers, three shochus, and... ten skewers of oden. That’ll be 465 yen in total."
"Here you go. Keep the change."
The misery of working for a cut-rate company that splits my meager 12,000-yen salary into three monthly installments vanished as I ripped open the pay envelope in my pocket. I pulled out five crisp 100-yen bills.
I stepped away from the stall, drifting into the night. It was a tepid autumn evening; the neon signs pulsed rhythmically, and with the alcohol burning in my gut, I felt invincible—ready for anything the world could throw at me. I stretched my arms wide and took a deep breath, and in that moment, my annoying boss and the soul-crushing paperwork were gone.
"Hey there... hey, mister. Want to have some fun?"
A woman glided up like a ghost and whispered hotly over my shoulder. Expecting a woman with a perm and scarlet lips, I spun around—only to freeze in shock. It was a shabby girl of fifteen or sixteen, with a bob cut and tiny, worn-down clogs. She gave me a bashful, sheepish grin. I was the one who ended up flustered.
"Wait, you?" I whispered. "You’re the one looking for customers?"
"...If you don't mind," she murmured, her voice almost fading away. Before I could tell her she had to be joking, she forestalled me.
"My big sister’s sick. Usually she’s the one who comes out, but..." She gave a little sniffle.
"How much?" I teased.
She answered with dead seriousness. "Don't you know? It's 500 yen for an hour, 1,000 for the night."
I suppressed the urge to laugh. "Look," I said, "you’re not going to get any business tonight anyway. Let me give you a bit of luck." I reached into my envelope and pulled out two 100-yen bills. "Go home and buy yourself some sweets. And tell your sister to get three shots of penicillin—I know it’s expensive, but tell her she needs them."
"But... is it really okay to just take this?" she asked, following after me.
"It’s fine, it’s fine. Just tell her some drunk uncle gave it to you."
I hurried away from the little substitute streetwalker, but suddenly, a wave of heat hit me, and my eyes blurred with tears, fogging my glasses. *Let her deceive me,* I thought. *Sometimes, you just have to let yourself be fooled.* Is this what they call 'the sentimental heart of a Buddha'? What a fool I am.

**3. The Princess of the Attic**
9:00 PM. More and more shops were shuttering their doors. The streets were thinning out. Heading south from Osaka Station, I rounded the ruins of the old Repatriation Center and found myself in the legendary Umeda Free Market. Stirred by an autumn night’s mischief and fueled by the alcohol, the women beckoning from the open doorways of the shanty bars looked strangely beautiful.
They say this area is a den for people whose Japanese sounds a bit... off. If you wander into the wrong shop and start flirting with a girl, local thugs will come charging in, drag you outside, beat you half to death, and strip you of every yen and stitch of clothing you own.
I have friends who’ve met that very fate, so I know the danger. And yet, I found myself wanting to know what these 'different' women were like. I searched for a sign that looked "purely Japanese" and, after pacing back and forth, finally mustered the courage to dive in.
Hand-written signs were pasted on the plywood walls: "Boiled Tofu: 30 yen," "Oden: 20 yen per skewer," "Appetizer: 10 yen," "Sake: 90 yen," "Shochu: 30 yen." The prices were clear enough. Inside, there was a quiet-looking madam and a waitress with a rather sickly complexion...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is structured into three vertical columns, typical of Japanese magazines. It features a prominent center title set in a stylized, bold calligraphic font that breaks the column flow, acting as a visual anchor.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard Mincho typeface common in mid-century printing. The title is much larger and more artistic. The use of repetition marks like "いよ〳〵" (iyoiya) is characteristic of the period's typesetting.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "都會の盛り場" (City Amusement Quarters) dominates the page, followed by the specific article subtitles "二、代用パン助" and "三、屋根裏の姫君" which are slightly larger and bolder than the body text.
*   **Graphic Elements:** The page number "( 33 )" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is part of a longer feature or a regular column in a literary or "low-brow" (kasutori) magazine.
*   **Formatting:** Dialogues are indented with brackets, creating a clear distinction between the narrator's internal thoughts/observations and the spoken interactions.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s - Early 1950s):** The mention of "penicillin" (a rare and expensive life-saving drug in post-war Japan), "repatriates" (引揚), and "barrack bars" (バラック飲屋) places this firmly in the Occupation era.
*   **Umeda Free Market (梅田自由市場):** This refers to the massive black market that sprung up around Osaka's Umeda Station after the war. These markets were lawless zones where everything from stolen rations to illegal services was sold.
*   **"Pan-pan" and "Pansuke":** These were slang terms for street prostitutes who catered to both GIs and Japanese men. "Daiyo" (substitute) implies the child is filling in for an adult, a grim reality of post-war poverty where families relied on children for income.
*   **Penicillin:** In the late 40s, penicillin was a miracle drug often associated with treating STIs or tuberculosis. Its mention here suggests the girl's sister is suffering from one of these common post-war afflictions.
*   **Prices:** The prices (e.g., 20 yen for oden, 12,000 yen monthly salary) reflect the hyper-inflationary period of the early 1950s.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **代用パン助 (Daiyō Pansuke):** A male or "substitute" version of the *pan-pan* girl. Here, it refers to a young girl acting as a stand-in for her sister.
*   **ピンタレ会社 (Pintare Kaisha):** Slang for a low-grade or "shady" company, often one that struggled to pay employees or operated in the grey market.
*   **おあいで (O-aide):** An old-fashioned or regional (Kansai) way of saying "the bill" or "the check."
*   **一瀉千里 (Issha Senri):** A four-character idiom (yojijukugo) meaning "to proceed at lightning speed" or "a sudden outpouring." Here it refers to the narrator's money flowing away quickly.
*   **多情仏心 (Tajō Busshin):** A sentimental or overly compassionate heart; having a "soft spot" that leads one to be easily moved to pity, even if it leads to being cheated.
*   **チヨツカイ (Chokkai):** To meddle with or, in this context, to flirt with or make a move on a woman.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Poverty and Survival:** The core subtext is the desperation of the post-war urban poor. A child being sent to "work" the streets because her sister is sick is presented with a mix of gritty realism and sentimentalism.
*   **The Male Gaze and Guilt:** The narrator oscillates between sexual excitement and paternalistic guilt. He initially seeks stimulation to forget his broken marriage and dull job, but is confronted by the reality of child labor, leading to a "sentimental Buddha-heart" moment where he gives money as charity rather than for a service.
*   **Xenophobia and the "Other":** The description of the "strange accents" and the "nest" of people near the market refers to the Korean and Chinese residents (Zainichi) who often ran the black markets. The narrator's fear and curiosity about "different flavors" reflect the ethnic tensions and exoticization of these communities in post-war Japan.
*   **The "Kasutori" Culture:** This text is a classic example of "Kasutori" literature—sensationalist, slightly erotic, and gritty reportage meant to provide cheap entertainment to a population struggling through recovery.
