**愛慾流転 コント集**

**年増妾の深情**
**矢部文吉**

化粧品のブローカーで金廻りはよいし、年は若くて男振りもまんざらでない石田文夫が、五つも年上のそれも藝者上りでソバカスの目立つた芳子を妾にしている事は、彼を知る者の皆不思議に思つているところであつた。
人一倍大柄であつた芳子はそれだけ普通の人より一層齢よりもふけて見せていたし、白粉ヤケのソバカスの散らばつた顔は素顔ではとても正視出来ないほどのやつれと見せていた。それは長い色街生活より来た荒淫が彼女の身体にそんな影響を表わしたものあろうが、彼女のそんなところだけを見たならば、決して妾になれるような女には見えなかつた。
文夫は荒い仕事で相当ボロイ儲け口も握つていたので收入も多かつたが、又使う方でも惜しげもなくパッパッと気前のよい遊び方をする方であつた。
丁度、今が仕事の方でも、女の方でも脂の乗りきつた齢で、精力的なエネルギーッシュな彼の活動は、自然芳子にばかり係つておられなくなり彼女の身体からも、遠ざかつて行つた。
しかしＸ×新地と呼ばれる色街の近くの裏通りにある妾宅へは、一週間に一回、それも土曜日にきまつて訪ねてきて、一晩泊つて行く彼であつた。商賣柄に似合わず彼はそうゆう點にかけては几帳面な男であつた。芳子にしても、文夫は月々のものははきちんきちんと届けて呉れるのでインフレの激しい暮らしにくい今の世の中では、有難い離れ難い旦那さんであつた。
それに自分の方には年上といつた弱味もあるし、彼女は、後生大事に文夫にかしづいて仕えていた。
その頃、文夫に新しく若い愛人が出来た。その女はキヤバレーに勤めている女給で芳子と比較すればずっと齢も若いしそれに洋装のよく似合う近代的な娘であつた。
それを傳え聞いた芳子の胸ははりさけんばかりであつた。勿論自分のような者が文夫を獨占する事を考えたことは無かつたが、それでも自分の外に若い愛人が文夫に出来たとゆう事になると人並の嫉妬が湧いてくるのであつた。
文夫は愛人が出来てからでも土曜日には定まつて芳子の妾宅へ足を運んだが、恰かも事務のように。
彼がいささか酔つて入つてきた土曜日の曉であつた。二階の奥の部屋へ蒲團を伸べると、彼はそのままもぐり込んで眠つてしまつた。
浮気とゆう事を忘れてしまつて只一人夜更けを守つている彼女としては堪えられない情慾の炎に胸をかきむしられるのであつた。
若い愛人と彼が、一緒にと思想するともう矢も盾もたまらなくなるのであつた。
「此れさえ無ければ、彼も愛人のところへ行かれないだろう」
そう想つた芳子は、鏡台の抽出から剃刀を取り出して、蒲團の裾をめくつた。途中で気のついた彼は
「何にすんねん、けったいなことしなや」
と言つたが、それと気付くど
「一その事、全部やつてんか、半分位残しといて面倒くさい」
翌朝になつて、彼を送り出してから芳子はさめ／＼と泣いた。彼にあんな事をした以上、もう来てくれないだろう。一時の嫉妬で彼を愛人の手もとへやりたくないばかりに大変なことをしてしまつたと思つた。
それから一週間経つた。
もう来てくれないと諦めていた文夫がいつもの様にひよつくりとやつて来た。
彼女は嬉しさのために心が躍つたが、色街できたえた年増女だけに、とびついて泣いて詫びると言うような事はせずに、それでも、いそ／＼と彼の羽織を手に取つた。
彼は前の土曜日のことはケロリと忘れたように言葉にも顔にも出さず長火鉢の横の蒲團の上にどかかりと座つた。
肉のスキ焼きで一、二杯飲んだ彼は甚だ上機嫌で奥にある床についた。
彼女にしては、彼の誠實に報ゆるつもりで、やさしく寄り添つた。
半月も男の肌から絶縁されていた彼女の焦慮もあろうが、それにも増して、彼が自分のやつた事を何にも言わず許してくれて、忘れずに訪ねて来てくれた事が嬉しくて済まさないいつぱいであつた。
暫くして、芳子が身もだえしながら叫んだ。
「堪忍して、あゝ痛い〜〜」
無數の尖つた針の先で攻められる痛さ、それが相当の範圍で弾みをも……

化粧品のブローカーで金回りは良いし、年は若くて男振りもまんざらでない石田文夫が、五つも年上の、それも芸者上がりでソバカスの目立った芳子を妾（めかけ）にしていることは、彼を知る者の皆が不思議に思っているところであった。
人一倍大柄であった芳子は、それだけ普通の人より一層、年齢よりも老けて見せていたし、白粉（おしろい）焼けのソバカスの散らばった顔は、素顔ではとても正視できないほどのやつれを見せていた。それは長い色街生活から来た荒淫（こういん）が彼女の身体にそんな影響を及ぼしたものであろうが、彼女のそんなところだけを見たならば、決して妾になれるような女には見えなかった。
文夫は荒い仕事で相当ボロい儲け口も握っていたので収入も多かったが、また使う方でも惜しげもなくパッパッと気前の良い遊び方をする方であった。
ちょうど、今が仕事の方でも女の方でも脂の乗りきった年齢で、精力的なエネルギッシュな彼の活動は、自然と芳子ばかりにかまっていられなくなり、彼女の身体からも遠ざかっていった。
しかし、「××新地」と呼ばれる色街の近くの裏通りにある妾宅へは、一週間に一回、それも土曜日に決まって訪ねてきて、一晩泊まっていく彼であった。商売柄に似合わず、彼はそういう点にかけては几帳面な男であった。芳子にしても、文夫は月々の手当をきちんと届けてくれるので、インフレの激しい暮らしにくい今の世の中では、ありがたい離れがたい旦那さんであった。
それに自分の方には年上といった弱みもあるし、彼女は後生大事に文夫にかしづいて仕えていた。

それを伝え聞いた芳子の胸は張り裂けんばかりであった。もちろん自分のような者が文夫を独占することを考えたことはなかったが、それでも自分の他に若い愛人が文夫にできたということになると、人並みの嫉妬が湧いてくるのであった。

翌朝になって、彼を送り出してから芳子はさめざめと泣いた。彼にあんな事をした以上、もう来てくれないだろう。一時の嫉妬で彼を愛人の手元へやりたくないばかりに、大変なことをしてしまったと思った。
それから一週間経った。
もう来てくれないと諦めていた文夫が、いつものようにひょっくりとやって来た。

**Lust’s Vicissitudes: Short Story Collection**

**The Deep Affection of an Older Mistress**
**by Yabe Bunkichi**

A cosmetic broker with good money circulation, age young and male-appearance not bad, Ishida Fumio—the fact that he kept as a mistress Yoshiko, five years older, furthermore a former geisha with prominent freckles, was something everyone who knew him thought strange.
Yoshiko, who was exceptionally large-framed, looked much older than her actual age compared to ordinary people, and her face, scattered with freckles from powder-burn (makeup damage), showed a haggardness that one could not look at directly when she was bare-faced. That might be because of the "excessive lustful living" resulting from long life in the red-light districts appearing on her body, but if one looked only at those parts of her, she did not look like a woman who could ever become a mistress.
Fumio, because of his rough work, held considerably "shady" profitable channels, so his income was high, but also on the spending side, he was one who played generously and lavishly.
Exactly now, in both work and women, he was at an age of peak vitality, and his energetic activities naturally meant he could not be involved only with Yoshiko, and he grew distant from her body as well.
However, to the mistress-house located in a back alley near the red-light district called "XX Shinchi," he was a man who unfailingly visited once a week, specifically on Saturdays, and stayed for one night. Uncharacteristic of his business style, in that regard, he was a meticulous man. For Yoshiko too, because Fumio delivered the monthly allowance strictly and punctually, in today’s world of intense inflation and difficult living, he was a precious husband-figure hard to let go of.
Furthermore, on her part, having the weakness of being older, she served and attended to Fumio with utmost devotion.
Around that time, a new young lover was made for Fumio. That woman was a waitress working at a cabaret; compared to Yoshiko, she was much younger in age, and furthermore, she was a modern girl whom Western clothes suited well.
Hearing of this, Yoshiko’s chest was almost bursting. Of course, someone like herself never thought of monopolizing Fumio, but even so, when it came to a young lover being made for Fumio besides herself, ordinary jealousy would well up.
Even after the lover was made, Fumio went to Yoshiko's house on Saturdays as scheduled, but it was almost like a business transaction.
It was the dawn of a Saturday when he came in somewhat drunk. When the futon was spread in the back room of the second floor, he crawled in just like that and fell asleep.
For her, who had forgotten about his cheating and was guarding the late night alone, her chest was torn by unbearable flames of passion.
When she imagined him together with the young lover, she could no longer restrain herself.
"If only he didn't have this, he wouldn't be able to go to the lover's place."
Thinking so, Yoshiko took a razor from the dressing table drawer and flipped over the hem of the futon. He, noticing halfway, said,
"What are you doing? Don't do anything weird."
But once he realized (what she intended), he said,
"Go ahead and do the whole thing. Leaving half is just a hassle."
The next morning, after seeing him off, Yoshiko wept bitterly. Having done such a thing to him, surely he would not come again. Out of a momentary jealousy and just not wanting to give him to the lover, she thought she had done a terrible thing.
A week passed from then.
Fumio, whom she had given up on thinking he wouldn't come, arrived unexpectedly just like usual.
Her heart danced with joy, but being an older woman seasoned in the red-light districts, she did not jump on him crying and apologizing; nevertheless, she hurriedly took his haori coat.
He, as if he had completely forgotten the previous Saturday, showing it neither in words nor on his face, sat heavily on the futon next to the long brazier.
After drinking one or two cups with beef sukiyaki, he was in a very good mood and went to bed in the back.
For her part, intending to repay his sincerity, she nestled close to him gently.
There was likely the anxiety of a woman who had been insulated from a man’s skin for half a month, but more than that, she was overwhelmed with happiness that he had forgiven what she did without a word and hadn't forgotten to visit.
After a while, Yoshiko screamed while writhing.
"Forgive me, ahh, it hurts—!"
The pain of being attacked by the tips of countless sharp needles. That, in a considerable area, with momentum...

**The Vicissitudes of Desire: A Collection of Tales**

**An Older Mistress's Devotion**
**by Yabe Bunkichi**

Ishida Fumio was a cosmetic broker with a thriving business, youth on his side, and a reasonably handsome face. To those who knew him, it was a perpetual mystery why he kept Yoshiko as his mistress. Not only was she five years his senior, but she was a former geisha whose face was marred by prominent freckles.
Exceptionally large-framed, Yoshiko looked even older than her years. Her skin, worn thin by years of heavy lead-based makeup, was so haggard that it was difficult to look at her directly when she was bare-faced. This physical toll was likely the result of a long, libertine life in the red-light districts, yet based on her appearance alone, no one would have pegged her as a woman kept for pleasure.
Fumio’s rough-and-tumble business dealings brought in a tidy sum of "easy money," and he was as generous with his spending as he was successful at earning, known for his lavish and spirited nights out.
At an age where he was in the prime of his life—both professionally and sexually—his energetic activities naturally drew him away from Yoshiko. He began to distance himself from her physically.
However, he remained a man of habit. Despite his irregular business, he was meticulous about one thing: he visited Yoshiko’s house, tucked away in a back alley near the red-light district known as "XX Shinchi," once every week on Saturday nights to stay over. For Yoshiko, Fumio was a "danna" (patron) she couldn't afford to lose. He never failed to deliver her monthly allowance, a vital lifeline in these difficult times of rampant inflation. Aware of the disadvantage of her age, she served him with the utmost, desperate devotion.
Then came the news that Fumio had found a new, younger lover—a waitress at a cabaret. Compared to Yoshiko, she was significantly younger and a modern "moga" who looked striking in Western dresses.
The news nearly broke Yoshiko’s heart. While she had never expected to have Fumio all to herself, the reality of a younger rival ignited a common, burning jealousy. Even after the new affair began, Fumio continued his Saturday visits, though they had become cold and perfunctory—little more than business transactions.
One Saturday at dawn, Fumio arrived slightly intoxicated. As soon as the bedding was laid out in the upstairs room, he crawled in and fell fast asleep. Yoshiko, who had spent the night alone, tormented by his infidelity, felt the flames of desire and resentment tearing at her chest. The thought of him with the younger girl was more than she could bear.
"If only he didn't have *this*," she thought, "he wouldn't be able to go to her."
Driven by this logic, Yoshiko pulled a razor from her dressing table and pulled back the futon. Fumio woke halfway.
"What the hell are you doing? Don't be crazy," he muttered. But then, realizing her intent to emasculate him, he added coldly, "If you're going to do it, do the whole thing. Leaving half is just a bother."
The next morning, after he left, Yoshiko wept uncontrollably. She was certain he would never return after such an incident. In a moment of madness, she had risked everything just to keep him from her rival.
A week passed. To her shock, Fumio showed up just like always. Her heart soared, but as a veteran of the pleasure quarters, she didn't throw a scene. She simply took his coat with trembling hands. Fumio acted as though the previous week had never happened, sitting down by the brazier without a word of reproach.
After a meal of sukiyaki and a few drinks, he went to bed in high spirits. Grateful for his silent forgiveness and his return, Yoshiko nestled close to him, her heart full of relief and a half-month’s worth of pent-up longing.
But suddenly, Yoshiko let out a cry of agony.
"Forgive me! Ah, it hurts—!"
It was the stinging pain of countless sharp needles piercing her skin. Over a wide area, with every movement...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese magazine format, featuring **vertical orientation** (tate-gaki) read from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style serif used in mid-20th-century printing. Notably, the text uses **full-sized "tsu" (つ)** instead of the modern small "tsu" (っ) for geminate consonants (e.g., "思つている" instead of "思っている"). This is a hallmark of pre-1946 orthography or conservative post-war printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   **Main Title:** The series title "愛慾流転 コント集" (Lust's Vicissitudes: Collection of Short Stories) is at the top right in a stylized, bold white-on-black graphic.
    *   **Story Title/Author:** The specific story title "年増妾の深情" (The Deep Affection of an Older Mistress) and the author "矢部文吉" (Yabe Bunkichi) are centered at the top of the text block.
    *   **Illustration:** A stylized silhouette of a woman’s profile is integrated into the title graphic, setting a noir/romantic tone.
*   **Columns:** The text is divided into several vertical columns, separated by thin vertical lines, common in mass-market magazines to improve readability.
*   **Page Numbering:** A small "17" is visible at the bottom center, flanked by dashes.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-WWII / Kasutori Culture):** The mention of "インフレの激しい" (intense inflation) and "キャバレー" (cabaret) suggests the late 1940s or early 1950s. This was the era of "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, pulp publications that focused on "3S" (Sex, Screen, and Sports) to provide escapism for a war-weary population.
*   **Mekake (妾):** The concept of a "mistress" or "concubine" was still socially recognized, if not legally sanctioned, during this period. Successful men often supported women in "mistress houses" (妾宅 - mekakutaku).
*   **Iromachi / Shinchi (色街 / 新地):** References to red-light districts. "Shinchi" (literally "New Land") often referred to areas designated for entertainment and prostitution (like Osaka’s Tobita Shinchi).
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The story reflects the precarious social position of older women in the sex trade or entertainment industry ("geisha-agari"). Once they lost their youth, their security depended entirely on the "sincerity" or whim of a male patron.
*   **Westernization:** The "modern girl" (moga) archetype is mentioned via the young lover who wears "Western clothes" (洋装) and works at a cabaret, contrasting with the protagonist who represents the older "traditional" world of the geisha and red-light districts.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **年増 (Toshima):** A term for an "older" woman, often used in the context of someone past her "prime" in the entertainment/sex industry.
*   **深情 (Shinjō):** Deep affection or intense feelings.
*   **藝者上り (Geisha-agari):** A woman who was formerly a geisha. In literature of this era, this often implies a certain world-weariness or specific set of social skills.
*   **白粉ヤケ (Oshiroi-yake):** "Makeup burn." Historically, white face powder (oshiroi) contained lead, which would permanently damage and darken the skin of geishas and actors over time.
*   **荒淫 (Kōin):** Excessive or wild lust/lewdness.
*   **ボロい儲け (Boroi mōke):** Easy money or "shady" profits.
*   **旦那 (Danna):** In this context, a patron or the man who financially supports a mistress.
*   **後生大事 (Goshō-daiji):** With utmost care; religiously; as if one's life depended on it.
*   **けったいな (Kettai-na):** A Kansai-dialect term meaning "strange," "weird," or "absurd." This indicates the characters are likely in the Osaka/Kyoto region.
*   **堪忍 (Kannin):** Forgiveness/Patience.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Cruelty of Aging:** The central conflict stems from Yoshiko’s loss of beauty and youth. Her "haggardness" is described in visceral detail, contrasting with the "modern" and "energetic" youth of Fumio and his new lover.
*   **Economic Dependency:** The story highlights how inflation and post-war hardship make the mistress-patron relationship one of survival rather than just romance.
*   **Jealousy and Madness:** The protagonist’s attempt to maim her lover (to prevent him from seeing another woman) represents the "dark side" of devotion—the "deep affection" of the title is actually a destructive, obsessive love.
*   **The "Twist" Ending:** Typical of the "conte" (short-short story) genre, the ending provides a sharp shock. The "pain of needles" at the end suggests a cruel revenge by the husband or a trap set by the rival lover (perhaps needles hidden in the bedding or clothing), turning the mistress's joy into physical agony.
