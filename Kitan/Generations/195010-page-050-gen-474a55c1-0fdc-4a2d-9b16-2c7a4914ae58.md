青年は、それから虹のような気焔を上げて彼の計画や映画界の批評で、夜の更けるまで百合枝（ゆりえ）を煙に巻くような話を続けた。
彼女の期待する練習も、撮影も、始まらぬうちに、彼女はこの月岡という青年のために処女を捧げ、いつの間にか夫婦のような関係で生活するようになっていた。
今更後悔したけれど、どうすることもできない。それに月岡の言葉はいつも元気で、将来の大きな計画に燃えているようであった。百合枝は、彼を信じないわけにいかなかった。世間というもの、裏を知らない彼女は、やがてスターとして活躍する夢を、なお広大に描いているほど、男の甘言に魅せられていた。
しかし、その幻もやがて無残に消え去る日が来た。ある日外から帰ってきた月岡は、非常に悶えている様子だった。百合枝は優しく慰めることを忘れない。男は頭を抱えて言った。

女という動物は騙されるのが好き
「私なら、そんなの嫌いだわ。男振りが良くてお金がふんだんにあって気前がいいなんて……そんな三拍子揃った男で、女にモテた例なんてないんですものね」

そして、若く麗わしき女性の紅唇から「年の若い男って頼りないのね」と絶叫せしめられる。

That signboard find, that excessive poverty-weakness-to light disappointment felt but, already anyway no-becoming. She resolutely that room into entered and guidance asked.

By one young man led-into room, there various posters and stills wall-full-of pasted-on were.

She anew greeted, and then movie actress aiming motive and resolve, etc. asked-as-was talked. Before long Tsukioka talk turned, her lodging-of matter-to reached.
"No, I specially relatives also acquaintances also not-have-is."
"Is that so, then—ah, right right, exactly this office-in vacant room exists, you know. For the time being, here stay-being-able-to how is? Currently, Tokyo-in houses also quite find-not-can, you see."
Sole reliance as, from afar Tokyo-to came production (company) was. She that kindness-to felt, any doubt without, there settle-down thing became.
Young man, after that rainbow-like spirit raising his plans and movie world-of criticism-with, night deepens until Yurie-to smoke-in-wrap-like talk continued.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

When she finally found the sign, its pathetic appearance gave her a slight pang of disappointment, but she had already come too far to turn back. Steeling herself, she entered the room and asked for assistance.
"Ah, I see. Welcome! We’ve only just started up, you see, so this is just a temporary office. Please, come in."
A young man led her into a room whose walls were plastered with various movie posters and production stills.
"I’m Tsukioka, the manager here. I expect you to study hard. We have very high hopes for you."
Yurie introduced herself properly and spoke of her reasons for wanting to become an actress and her level of determination. Eventually, Tsukioka shifted the conversation to her living arrangements.
"No, I don't have any relatives or acquaintances here in the city," she admitted.
"Is that so? Well then—oh, I just remembered. There's a vacant room right here in the office. Why not stay here for a while? Houses are nearly impossible to find in Tokyo these days, after all."
This production company was the only thing Yurie had to rely on after traveling all the way to the capital. Touched by his kindness, she moved in without a shred of doubt.
From then on, the young man would talk grandly of his ambitious plans and offer critiques of the film industry until late into the night, keeping Yurie in a daze with his dazzling rhetoric.
Before the training or filming she had anticipated could even begin, she surrendered her virginity to Tsukioka, and before she knew it, they were living together like a married couple.
Though she had her regrets, there was nothing she could do now. Besides, Tsukioka was always so energetic, seemingly consumed by his grand designs for the future. Yurie couldn't help but believe in him. Knowing nothing of the world or its dark underside, she remained captivated by his sweet words, her dreams of stardom growing ever more vast.
But the day eventually came when the illusion cruelly shattered. One day, Tsukioka returned home looking utterly tormented. Yurie, ever the gentle companion, tried to comfort him. The man clutched his head and groaned.
"It's over. Our plans are going to fall apart. I need money..."
"My goodness, what happened?"
"It's no use talking about it. Telling you will only make you worry."
"Oh, so you won't tell me? I know I probably can't be of much help, but still..."
"Now you're angry."
"Well, of course, if you won't tell me what's wrong!"
"Fine, I'll tell you. Here's the situation."
According to him, the first production of "XX Productions," which was supposed to start filming soon, was about to be cancelled because they couldn't pay the original author in time. If they didn't pay, the filming rights would be snatched up by someone else.
"It’s only 50,000 yen, but if I can’t get it by tonight, we're finished. Even if I contacted my family back home, a telegram wouldn't explain the urgency. There isn't enough time for me to go there and back. I’ve given up."
"50,000 yen... isn't there some way we can find it?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure**: The page is divided into two main sections of text flanking a central illustration. It follows the traditional Japanese vertical right-to-left reading order.
*   **Typography**: Uses a standard Mincho typeface common in mid-century publications. Furigana (reading aids) are provided for less common kanji and names (e.g., 百合枝 / Yurie, 焔 / honoo, 跪づこう / hizamazukou).
*   **Illustration**: The central illustration features a stylized, slightly modernist drawing of a woman in Western-style clothing looking down at a man who appears to be in a state of supplication or distress. This visual serves as a "teaser" for the dramatic climax of the story.
*   **Formatting Elements**: The use of "XXプロダクション" (XX Production) suggests a placeholder name common in pulp fiction or a way to avoid legal issues with real companies. Punctuation includes the use of "――" for trailing thoughts and brackets for dialogue.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The bold title at the bottom right, "女という動物は 騙されるのが好き" (Women are animals who love to be deceived), acts as the thematic anchor for the page, even though the narrative text starts at the top.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII/1950s)**: The mention of "XX Production," the difficulty of finding housing in Tokyo, and the term "Après-guerre" (Apre) firmly place this in the post-war reconstruction era.
*   **Après-guerre (Apre-Girl)**: The text mentions an "超アプレガールの彼女" (Ultra Après-guerre girl). This term referred to the youth who rejected traditional Japanese values following the surrender in 1945, often characterized by Western fashion, cynicism, and a search for individual pleasure.
*   **The "Kasutori" Magazine Culture**: This text is likely from a *Kasutori* magazine—cheap, pulp publications that flourished in the late 40s. They were known for stories involving romance, scandals, and "fuzoku" (social mores), often with a cynical or slightly erotic edge.
*   **50,000 Yen**: In the early 1950s, 50,000 yen was a substantial sum, roughly equivalent to several months' salary for a professional worker (or roughly 1-2 million yen today), making it a plausible "crisis" amount for a struggling production office.
*   **The "Talent Scout" Scam**: The story depicts a classic scam where a man lures a young woman with dreams of stardom to exploit her sexually and financially—a common trope in cautionary tales of the era.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **煙に巻く (Kemu ni maku)**: Literally "to wrap in smoke." It means to baffle or bewilder someone with grand, confusing talk.
*   **処女を捧げる (Shojo o sasageru)**: "To offer one's virginity." A common literary euphemism of the period for a woman having sex for the first time, often framed as a sacrifice or a loss of innocence.
*   **甘言 (Kangen)**: "Sweet talk" or flattery designed to deceive.
*   **三拍子 (San-byoushi)**: Literally "three beats." It refers to a "triple threat" or a person who has all three ideal qualities (e.g., looks, money, and personality).
*   **ヤニ下がる (Yani-sagaru)**: To look self-satisfied or to smirk, often in a lecherous or condescending way.
*   **いかもの喰い (Ikamono-gui)**: One who has a taste for "fake" or strange, low-quality things. Used here to insult women's supposed taste in men.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Misogyny and Cynicism**: The title "Women are animals who love to be deceived" reflects a common post-war cynical outlook toward women's agency. It suggests that women are complicit in their own exploitation because they are "fooled" by their own romantic fantasies.
*   **The Loss of Innocence**: Yurie represents the "country girl" archetype who comes to Tokyo with pure dreams, only to be corrupted or used by the harsh reality of the city.
*   **Gender Power Dynamics**: The text portrays a tug-of-war. While Yurie is being scammed, the second half of the text describes "modern girls" (Apre-girls) who are cynical enough to "kick" a man in the face, yet the narrator concludes they are still "reliable-less" or easily fooled by the "wrong" kind of men.
*   **Post-War Disillusionment**: The "rainbow-like" plans of Tsukioka are built on nothing. This mirrors the general feeling of the era where grand promises often led to "smoke" and "mirages."
