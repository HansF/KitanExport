そして、あれだけの舞台効果を上げた村田の力量は底知れなかった。
しかし、この生きたショーは、観客に対して十分すぎる満足を与えることができた反面、由美の心を完全に打ち砕いてしまった。
二十二年間守り続けてきた女の誇りも、女性の最も恥ずかしい状態の中で、見るも無惨に破られてしまったのだ。

このように村田の演出は病的に鋭く、演技者の本能と心理を巧みに利用して部分的なセリフを教えるのみで、一言の内容の説明すら与えず、次々と素晴らしいショーを組み立てて行った。それに反比例して、由美の神経はそのたびごとに荒んで行った。
こうして契約期限の六ヶ月が終わった頃には、身も心もくたくたに疲れ果てていた。
そしてようやく解放された時にはすでに、由美の悲しい努力も虚しく、たった一人生き残っていた兄は寂しく黄泉の空へ旅立った後であった。
何もかも失ってしまった由美は、もはや何の生き甲斐もなかった。
荒みきった身体は、もはやストリップショーのエキストラさえもできなくなっていた。

彼女はストリップでも食べて行けなくなったので、飛田（トビタ）の花街で接客婦として働いていた。
由美は勧められて彼女と同じ家で働くことになった。
戦災で、家と肉親を失くし、たった一人の兄も病死し、最後に貞操まで失って、ついに花街で素裸になって男の欲情の前に身をさらす運命に泣くのであった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

I told my father. 
Father was indignant. 
The incident became public knowledge. 
However, a girl from a nameless house taking on a first-class businessman in the capital to cause a problem—what would become of that? 
Even so, there was a great difference in status. 
As a result, she, on the contrary, for the thing called "blackmail," ended up being prosecuted. 
Gold, gold, gold, gold made everything unfavorable. 
With that as the cause, the inside story of the Emerald Club was exposed and then it came to be closed.

And then? 
Until the present, where she, in this way, in a corner of the South (Minami), wearing heavy makeup, comes to be a bar waitress—that was a fixed path walked by a woman who once mistook her course. 
Moreover, that path is still only halfway. 
A fallen woman, in order to keep living, while being toyed with by men, without a reason for living, unable to rise up, from man to man, with her nakedness she was challenging them. 
Among the nightly men, even if there was a man she thought she wanted to seriously love or be loved by, it was still no good. 
The men who became her partners were all only for that moment, aiming for her flesh. 
Ah, from now? ... 
Only falling more, and more ...

(Beside the illustration)
Yumi

And, the ability of Murata who raised that much stage effect was bottomless. 
However, while this "living show" was able to give more than enough satisfaction to the audience, on the other hand, it completely crushed Yumi's heart. 
The pride of a woman she had protected for twenty-two years, in the most shameful state for a female, was miserably broken. 
Yumi could not even cry. 
For two or three days, becoming like a dead person, she stayed shut in her room. 
Soon, on the same day of the next week, made to wear a kimono in the same way, while tied behind her back with thin cords, a poisonous insect was put into her chest. While writhing in intense itching and suffering to the limit, the rope broke, and when her hands became free, she was in only a single under-robe (nagajuban), and just as she squeezed the insect to death with her breasts exposed, a man who had become naked in the next room while waiting impatiently jumped in. 
In this way, Murata’s direction was pathologically sharp, skillfully using the instincts and psychology of the performer, only teaching partial lines without giving even a word of explanation of the content, he went on assembling wonderful shows one after another. In inverse proportion to that, Yumi’s nerves became desolate every time. 
In this way, by the time the six-month contract period ended, her body and soul were worn out and exhausted. 
And when finally she was released, already, Yumi’s sad efforts were in vain, and her only remaining brother had already lonely departed for the sky of the Yellow Springs (the afterlife). 
Yumi, who had lost everything, no longer had any reason to live. 
Her completely ravaged body was no longer able to even be an extra in a striptease show. 
Having resolved to die, while wandering looking for a place to die, she was called out to by an old companion. 
Since she could no longer eat even through striptease, she was working as a hostess in the Tobita pleasure quarters. 
Yumi was encouraged and came to work at the same house as her. 
Having lost her home and relatives in war damage, her only brother having died of illness, and finally losing even her chastity, she finally became naked in the pleasure quarters and exposed her body before the lust of men, weeping at her fate.
—The End—

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

I confessed everything to my father. He was furious, and the matter was eventually brought to light. But what hope does a girl from an obscure family have when she pits herself against a titan of industry? Despite the gravity of the incident, the chasm in social standing was too vast. In a cruel twist of fate, the tables were turned on her; she was the one prosecuted—for "blackmail." Money, money, money—it was money that tipped the scales against her at every turn. Because of this, the scandalous inner workings of the Emerald Club were exposed, leading to its eventual closure.

And after that? To look at her now, slathered in heavy makeup in a dive bar in the Minami district, one sees the inevitable destination of a woman who once lost her way. It is a well-trodden path, and she is only halfway down it. A fallen woman, she endures the whims of men just to survive. Lacking any purpose in life and unable to pull herself out of the mire, she drifts from one man to the next, using her naked body as her only weapon. Though she occasionally finds a man she truly wishes to love or be loved by, it always ends in failure. To the men she services, she is nothing more than a temporary vessel for their lust. What lies ahead for her? Nothing but a deeper, darker descent.

(Beside the illustration)
Yumi

The directorial prowess of a man named Murata was truly terrifying. While his "living shows" were a triumph of stagecraft that left audiences more than satisfied, they utterly shattered Yumi’s spirit. The dignity she had guarded for twenty-two years was ruthlessly crushed in the most humiliating of circumstances. Yumi was beyond even the solace of tears. For days, she remained locked in her room, a living ghost.

The following week, the nightmare repeated. She was dressed in a kimono, her hands bound behind her back, and a stinging insect was dropped into her bosom. As she writhed in agony from the intense itching, her bindings finally snapped. Just as she managed to crush the insect, her breasts exposed in nothing but her thin under-robe, a man who had been waiting naked and impatient in the adjoining room burst in upon her. Murata’s direction was pathologically cruel; he manipulated the raw instincts and psychology of his performers, never explaining the plot, only barking out fragments of dialogue to piece together his "masterpieces." With every performance, Yumi’s mental state withered further.

By the time her six-month contract expired, she was a hollow shell. When she was finally granted her freedom, she discovered that her sacrifices had been for nothing—her only surviving brother, whom she had hoped to save, had already passed away. Stripped of everything, Yumi lost her will to live. Her body was so ravaged that she could no longer even find work as a strip-show extra. As she wandered the streets looking for a place to end her life, she was stopped by a former colleague who was now working in the Tobita red-light district.

At her friend’s urging, Yumi took up work at the same brothel. Having lost her home and family to the fires of war, seeing her brother succumb to illness, and finally losing her last shred of virtue, she now finds herself weeping at her destiny—exposed and naked in the pleasure quarters, a mere object for the lust of men.
—The End—

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a dense, multi-column vertical format characteristic of mid-century Japanese magazines. The layout uses "wrap-around" text surrounding hand-drawn illustrations.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface typical of the era. It uses traditional orthography (e.g., small "tsu" is written full-size, and historical kana like ゐ are implied or used in the era's standard).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title/lead-in is at the top right, with the main narrative flowing downward and to the left. The character's name "由美" (Yumi) is placed prominently next to a portrait.
*   **Illustrations:** The illustrations are in a "Gekiga" or early pulp style. They depict the heroine in various states of distress: a pensive portrait, a group strip-show scene, and a dramatic scene of her being approached by a man. These serve as "eye candy" for the target male audience of *Kasutori* magazines.
*   **Column Structure:** The text breaks into irregular blocks to accommodate the art, creating a cluttered, sensory-overload aesthetic typical of sensationalist literature.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-War 1940s-50s):** This is the era of the "Kasutori" magazine—cheap, sensationalist publications named after a low-grade dregs-based shochu that was said to make one sick after three cups (just as these magazines were said to fold after three issues).
*   **Tobita (トビタ):** Refers to **Tobita Shinchi** in Osaka, one of the largest and most famous red-light districts in Japan. Even after the Prostitution Prevention Law of 1956, it continued to operate under the guise of "ryotei" (restaurants).
*   **War Damage (戦災 - Sensai):** The text mentions the protagonist lost her family and home in the war. This was a common reality for millions in post-war Japan, often used in literature to explain a character's "fall" into sex work.
*   **Striptease Culture:** Post-war Japan saw a massive boom in striptease and "theatrical" erotic shows (like the "Emerald Club" mentioned) as censorship loosened under the US Occupation and people sought cheap, base entertainment.
*   **Pan-pan Girls & Bar Hostesses:** The transition from a "proper" girl to a bar hostess (女給 - jokyu) and eventually to a prostitute in Tobita represents the classic "downward spiral" trope of the era.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **表沙汰 (Omote-zata):** To become public knowledge, especially a scandal or legal matter.
*   **女給 (Jokyu):** Literally "female server," specifically a bar waitress or hostess. In this era, the line between hostess and sex worker was often blurred.
*   **転落女 (Tenraku-onna):** A "fallen woman." A common archetypal character in melodrama.
*   **生甲斐 (Ikigai):** A reason for living; purpose.
*   **長襦袢 (Nagajuban):** A long under-kimono worn beneath the outer kimono. Being seen in just a *nagajuban* was considered highly erotic/indecent.
*   **黄泉 (Yomi):** The land of the dead in Japanese mythology.
*   **貞操 (Teiso):** Chastity or virtue. The loss of *teiso* was traditionally framed as the ultimate tragedy for a female character.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Injustice of Wealth:** The repeated "Gold, gold, gold" highlights a cynical view of the post-war economy where the rich (the "first-class businessman") can manipulate the law to crush the poor.
*   **Nihon-shiki Noir:** The tone is bleak, fatalistic, and melodramatic. There is no redemption; the protagonist is "destined" to fall further.
*   **Male Gaze & Exploitation:** While the text purports to "pity" Yumi, the detailed description of her humiliation (the insect in the bosom, her nakedness) is clearly designed for the erotic titillation of the male reader.
*   **Post-War Nihilism:** The loss of family and home to "war damage" serves as the catalyst for the loss of morality. It suggests a society where the traditional structures (family, honor) have been vaporized.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story/Serial), Pulp Fiction.
*   **Genre:** Ero-Guro (Erotic-Grotesque), Melodrama, Tragedy.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Fallen Woman, Sex Work, Poverty, Corruption, Blackmail, Tobita Shinchi, Human Rights Abuses (Show Business).
*   **Classification:** Mature/Sensationalist.
