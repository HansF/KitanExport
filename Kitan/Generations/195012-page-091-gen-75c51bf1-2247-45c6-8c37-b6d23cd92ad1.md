「……に行くのが嫌でなかつたら、私が言つておきましょう。しかし、見ている間一言も声を立てないことをお約束してくれなきやいけませんよ」
「ええ」
　どうしてそんな事を言うのか、よく分らなかつたが、清子は素直に返をした。
　やがて、
「さあ、もうそろそろ始まるでしようから、行つて見ませんか」
　松井は気になつてドアの方へ向つた。
　清子も仕方なく松井の後について、始めて大きな黒いドアの中へ足をはこんだ。
　そこには、真赤なじうたんをはつた、長い廊下があり、その両側には、小さな扉がいくつも、いくつも並んでいた。そこを彼女は、松井に肩を抱かれながら眞すぐに進んだ。
　つきあたりの部屋の前まで行つたとき、松井は、一か八か図でもする調子で、ドアをノックした。
　開かれたドアの向うは、かなり広い部屋だつた。一方の壁に銀色の小さなくリーンがあり、寄木細工の床には、バア・ルウムのように、椅子やテーブルが並べられてあつた。
「まあ」
　入るなり、清子は頬を紅くした。あとずさりしたというのは、どの椅子にも男女が一組づつ、見ているにたえないしぐさで、グラスをあけていたからだつた。それはみんな、平然としたら、すまし返つている紳士や、会社の重役連、奥様連中だつた。
「約束！　もう何も言つちやいけませんよ。いいですか」
　と、松井は、清子の背中へ軽く手を廻して、片隅の椅子に案内した。
「いよう！　松井君、今日は可愛らしい小鳥を連れて来ましたなー」
　誰かが大仰に言うと、どつと笑い声や拍手が起つた。彼女は急に何となく、恐しくなつて、また一方には、いささか冒険心もあつたが、

（中略 - Illustration area）

別に契約金として五万圓出すと云うんだ……どうだい？その代り条件が君には難しいと思うんだが……」
「……」
　うちのスターだつて三万圓貰つている女は一人も居ない、その上契約金が五万圓も貰えるのだ、それにしても難しいつて、どんな条件なんだろう。
「つまりクラブの踊り子になれば最初の二ケ月間はクラブの秘密を守るために外出を絶対許さないと云う事なんだ。たどそれ丈の事なんだが、君の場合少し無理じやないかと思うんだ。勿論契約金と二ケ月分の給料は契約と同時に出す上、クラブに居る間の食費も宿泊費も一切負担すると云うのだがね」
　夢ならばさめずに居てくれと願わずには居れなかつた。全部合わせて十一万圓、それだけあればサナトリウムに入院させて人を雇つて看病させる事だつて出来るのだ。自分の生活費が全然要らないと云う事も大きな魅力であつた。

　その夜、由美は約束の梅田駅頭に、手渡されたバッヂをつけて、立つていた。
　丁度、約束の時刻に四八年型の自家用車が由美の眼前に停車すると、彼女を乗せて走りはじめた。中には昨日逢つたプロデューサー村田が居た。
「目隠しをしますから、しばらく窮屈でしようけれど辛抱して下さい。」
　眞黒い布で固く眼を掩われた。車はどこを走つているのか分らない。四、五十分も経つた頃、音を立てずにすべり込むように停車すると、あたりは、蒼としたヒマラヤ・シーダの樹立であつた。眼の前に真白い洋館が浮かび上つていた。
　長い廊下を曲り曲つて四帖半位の、瀟洒な洋室へ入つた。
「さあ、これが君の部屋です。あとで、ボーイがやつて来て、いろゝな事を説明するでしよう。それ迄に、こゝに、着物をそろえてありますから、君の身についているものを全部脱いで、着替えておいて下さい。もう一時間もすれば舞台が開きます。来週からは本格的なものを演つてもらいますが、今日は顔見世と云つた意味で、そのまゝ出てもらいますから…」
　と村田が出て行つた。
　由美は早速上衣をとり、シュミーズを脱いで、用意された着物を手にとつた。薄もの、眼もさめる様な真紅の腰巻に、桃色のなまめかしい長襦袢と、紫地の色あざやかな着物を引つかけると、サッとズロースも脱いでしまつた。やつと着付が終つた頃、待つていた様に純白の洋服を着たボーイが入つて来て、クラブの色々な事を細々と説明して出て行つた。

　突き当たりの部屋の前まで行ったとき、松井は一か八か、何かに挑戦するような調子で、ドアをノックした。
　開かれたドアの向こうは、かなり広い部屋だった。一方の壁に銀色の小さなスクリーンがあり、寄木細工の床には、バアルーム（バールーム）のように、椅子やテーブルが並べられてあった。
「まあ」
　入るなり、清子は頬を赤らめた。後ずさりしたのは、どの椅子にも男女が一組ずつ、見るに堪えない仕草でグラスを空けていたからだった。それは皆、平然と澄まし返っている紳士や、会社の重役連、奥様連中だった。
「約束！ もう何も言っちゃいけませんよ。いいですか」

「別に契約金として五万円出すと言うんだ……どうだい？ その代わり条件が君には難しいと思うんだが……」
「……」
　うちのスターだって三万円もらっている女は一人もいない。その上、契約金が五万円ももらえるのだ。それにしても「難しい」とは、どんな条件なのだろう。
「つまり、クラブの踊り子になれば、最初の二ヶ月間はクラブの秘密を守るために外出を絶対許さないということなんだ。たったそれだけのことなんだが、君の場合、少し無理じゃないかと思うんだ。もちろん契約金と二ヶ月分の給料は契約と同時に出す上、クラブにいる間の食費も宿泊費も一切負担するというのだがね」
　夢ならば覚めずにいてくれと願わずにはいられなかった。全部合わせて十一万円。それだけあればサナトリウムに入院させて人を雇って看病させることだって出来るのだ。自分の生活費が全然要らないということも大きな魅力であった。

　その夜、由美は約束の梅田駅頭に、手渡されたバッジをつけて立っていた。
　ちょうど約束の時刻に1948年型の自家用車が由美の目前に停車すると、彼女を乗せて走り始めた。中には昨日会ったプロデューサー村田がいた。
「目隠しをしますから、しばらく窮屈でしょうけれど辛抱して下さい」
　真っ黒な布で固く目を覆われた。車はどこを走っているのか分からない。四、五十分も経った頃、音を立てずに滑り込むように停車すると、あたりは青々としたヒマラヤシーダーの樹立であった。目の前に真っ白い洋館が浮かび上がっていた。
　長い廊下を曲がりくねって、四畳半ほどの、洒落た洋室へ入った。
「さあ、これが君の部屋です。あとでボーイがやって来て、いろいろな事を説明するでしょう。それまでにここに用意した着物に着替えておいて下さい。身につけているものは全部脱いでくださいね。もう一時間もすれば舞台が開きます。来週からは本格的なものを演じてもらいますが、今日は顔見せという意味で、そのまま出てもらいますから……」
　と村田が出て行った。
　由美は早速上着を取り、シュミーズを脱いで、用意された着物を手に取った。薄物、目も覚めるような真紅の腰巻に、桃色の艶めかしい長襦袢と、紫地の鮮やかな着物を羽織ると、さっと下着も脱いでしまった。やっと着付けが終わった頃、待っていたかのように純白の制服を着たボーイが入ってきて、クラブの色々な事を細々と説明して出て行った。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

III
"...If to go there is not hateful, I shall tell them. However, during the time you are looking, one word also you must not make a sound, that you must promise."
"Yes."
Why such a thing he says, she did not well understand, but Kiyoko obediently gave a reply.
Presently,
"Well, soon it will probably begin, so shall we go see?"
Matsui, becoming concerned, headed toward the door.
Kiyoko, having no choice, followed behind Matsui, and for the first time into a large black door set foot.
There, a crimson carpet was laid, a long corridor existed, and on its both sides, small doors many, many were lined up. There she, while her shoulder was held by Matsui, straight forward advanced.
When reaching the front of the room at the end, Matsui, with a tone of "hit or miss" (all or nothing), knocked the door.
The beyond of the opened door was a fairly wide room. On one wall a silver small screen existed, and on the parquet floor, like a bar-room, chairs and tables were lined up.
"Oh my."
Upon entering, Kiyoko made her cheeks red. That she recoiled was because, at every chair, men and women in pairs, in gestures unbearable to look at, were emptying glasses. They were all, if appearing calm, composed gentlemen, company executives, and groups of wives.
"The promise! Now, you must not say anything. Is it okay?"
So Matsui, lightly turning a hand to Kiyoko’s back, guided her to a corner chair.
"Hey! Matsui-kun, today a cute little bird you have brought, haven't you!"
When someone said grandly, a burst of laughter and applause arose. She suddenly somehow became afraid, and also on the other hand, a bit of adventurous spirit existed, but...

(Omitted)

"Separately, as contract money, 50,000 yen [they] say they will give... how about it? Instead, the conditions for you I think are difficult, but..."
"..."
Even among our stars, 30,000 yen receiving woman one person does not exist. On top of that, contract money 50,000 yen also can be received. Even so, "difficult"—what kind of conditions are they?
"In other words, if you become a club dancer, for the first two months, in order to protect the club's secrets, going out is absolutely not allowed, is what it means. Only that much it is, but in your case, I think it might be a bit forced. Of course, contract money and two months' worth of salary will be given at the same time as the contract, plus while at the club, food expenses and lodging expenses all will be borne [by them]."
If it were a dream, she could not help but pray it would not wake. Combined, 110,000 yen. If there were that much, she could put [someone] in a sanatorium and hire a person to nurse them. The fact that her own living expenses were completely unnecessary was also a great attraction.

II
That night, Yumi at the promised Umeda Station front, wearing the handed-over badge, was standing.
Exactly at the promised time, a '48 model private car in front of Yumi’s eyes stopped, and taking her on board, began to run. Inside, the producer Murata met yesterday was there.
"I will do a blindfold, so for a while it will be cramped, but please endure."
With a pitch-black cloth, eyes were firmly covered. Where the car was running, she did not know. After 40 or 50 minutes passed, stopping as if sliding in without making a sound, the surroundings were a stand of green Himalayan cedars. In front of her eyes, a pure white Western-style building floated up.
Winding through long corridors, she entered a four-and-a-half-tatami sized, elegant Western room.
"Now, this is your room. Later, a boy (waiter) will come and explain various things. Until then, since I have prepared clothes here, please take off everything on your body and change. In another hour, the stage will open. From next week, I will have you perform serious things, but today, in the sense of a 'face-showing' (debut), I will have you go out as you are..."
And Murata went out.
Yumi immediately took off her jacket, removed her chemise, and took the prepared clothes in hand. Thin material, a waking-the-eyes crimson waist-wrap, a pink alluring long under-robe, and a purple-grounded vivid kimono when she threw on, she quickly took off her drawers (underpants) too. When finally the dressing ended, as if waiting, a boy wearing a pure white Western suit came in, explained the club's various things in detail, and went out.
(In the nightclub, what kind of fearful...)

**III**
"If you don't find the idea of going there too repulsive, I'll put in a word for you. However, you must promise me one thing: not a single word is to leave your lips while you are inside."
"I understand."
Kiyoko didn't quite grasp why he was being so secretive, but she gave her word nonetheless.
Presently, Matsui turned toward the door, looking restless. "Well, it should be starting soon. Shall we?"
Reluctantly, Kiyoko followed him, stepping through a massive black door for the first time.
Beyond lay a long corridor carpeted in deep crimson, lined with row upon row of small doors. Matsui placed a hand on her shoulder, guiding her straight ahead. When they reached the door at the very end, Matsui knocked with the air of a man placing a final, desperate bet.
The door opened to a spacious room. A small silver screen was mounted on one wall, and the parquet floor was crowded with tables and chairs, reminiscent of a high-end lounge.
"Oh!" Kiyoko gasped, her cheeks flushing crimson. She instinctively recoiled; at every table, couples were entwined in scandalous displays of affection while nursing their drinks. These were not street thugs, but the very picture of respectability: composed gentlemen, corporate executives, and high-society wives.
"Your promise! Not a word," Matsui whispered, his hand sliding to the small of her back as he ushered her to a corner seat.
"Well now, Matsui! You've brought quite the pretty little bird today, haven't you?" someone called out grandly, triggering a burst of laughter and applause. Fear suddenly gripped her, yet beneath the dread, a spark of adventurous curiosity flickered.

(Omitted)

"They’re offering fifty thousand yen as a signing bonus," the man said. "What do you think? Though I suspect the conditions might be a bit much for you..."
Yumi remained silent. Not even the top stars at her current place made thirty thousand, and here was a fifty-thousand-yen bonus on the table. What could these "difficult" conditions possibly be?
"In short, if you become a dancer for the club, you won't be allowed to step foot outside for the first two months. It’s to ensure the club’s secrets are kept. That’s all there is to it, but I thought it might be too much of a sacrifice for you. Of course, they’ll pay the bonus and two months' salary upfront, and they cover all room and board while you're there."
Yumi prayed she wouldn't wake from this dream. A total of one hundred and ten thousand yen... with that kind of money, she could finally afford to put her loved one in a sanatorium and hire professional care. The fact that she wouldn't have to spend a dime on her own living expenses was the ultimate lure.

**II**
That night, Yumi stood outside Umeda Station as agreed, the identification badge pinned to her coat. Precisely on time, a 1948 model sedan pulled up. She climbed inside to find Murata, the producer she had met the day before.
"I’m going to have to blindfold you. It will be uncomfortable for a while, but please bear with it."
He bound her eyes tightly with a thick black cloth. She lost all sense of direction as the car drove on. After nearly an hour, the car came to a silent, smooth stop. When the blindfold was removed, she found herself surrounded by a dense grove of Himalayan cedars. Emerging from the greenery was a stark white Western-style mansion.
She was led through a maze of corridors into a small but elegant Western-style room.
"This is your room," Murata said. "A steward will be by shortly to explain the details. In the meantime, take off everything you're wearing and change into the clothes I've laid out here. The show starts in an hour. We'll have you doing the real routines starting next week, but for tonight, you're just making a 'face-showing' appearance."
After Murata left, Yumi quickly shed her jacket and chemise. She picked up the garments provided: a sheer, eye-popping crimson waist-wrap, an alluring pink under-robe, and a vibrant purple kimono. She even discarded her undergarments to achieve the right silhouette. Just as she finished, a steward in a crisp white uniform entered to give her the run-down of the club's operations.
(Inside the nightclub, what terrifying fate awaited her...)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** This is a classic "Yomimono" (reading matter) layout common in Japanese magazines of the late 1940s and 1950s. The text is arranged in three distinct vertical columns, interrupted by a central illustration.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The section numbers (二 and 三) are used to denote scene breaks. The story uses an inverted chronological order or jumps between perspectives, as "III" appears before "II" on this specific layout (though this may be due to the way the page was scanned or the story's non-linear structure).
*   **Typography:** The body text is set in a standard Mincho typeface. Punctuation follows the conventions of the era, including the use of "..." (ellipses) and distinctive quotation marks. The kanji includes *Kyūjitai* (old forms) like 圓 (yen), 眞 (true), and 變 (change), which were phased out post-1946 but persisted in popular literature for years.
*   **Illustrations:** The line drawings are suggestive but stylized. They depict a woman (likely the protagonist) in various states of dress and emotional distress, and a car (the 1948 model mentioned). The style is reminiscent of "Kasutori" magazines, which often balanced legitimate literature with sensationalist or erotic-grotesque imagery.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-War 1940s/50s):** The mention of a "1948 model car" places the story squarely in the immediate post-war period. This was an era of extreme poverty for many, contrasted with the "New Yen" millionaires and the burgeoning underground economy of nightclubs (*pan-pan* girls, cabaret dancers, and black markets).
*   **Economic Context:** The sums mentioned (50,000 yen contract, 110,000 yen total) were astronomical. In 1948-1949, the average monthly salary for a government worker was around 3,000 to 5,000 yen. The "110,000 yen" would be equivalent to several years of salary, explaining why the protagonist is willing to accept such "difficult conditions."
*   **Sanatoriums:** Mentioning a "sanatorium" (サナトリウム) is a common trope in early 20th-century Japanese literature (e.g., *The Wind Has Risen*). Tuberculosis was still a major health crisis in post-war Japan, and the need for expensive medical care was a common motive for characters to enter the "dark side" of the entertainment world.
*   **Westernization:** The setting is a "pure white Western mansion" (白洋館) and the clothes include a "chemise" (シュミーズ). This reflects the fascination with Western luxury and the "exotic" nature of modern nightclubs during the Allied Occupation.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **一か八か (Ichika-bachika):** A common idiom meaning "all or nothing" or "sink or swim." Here, it describes the tension of the scene.
*   **サナトリウム (Sanatorium):** A medical facility for long-term illness, specifically tuberculosis. It implies a tragic backstory for the protagonist.
*   **顔見世 (Kaomise):** Originally a Kabuki term for the first performance of the season where the actors are introduced. Here, it refers to a "debut" where the dancer is shown to the customers without a full routine.
*   **なまめかしい (Namamekashii):** Alluring, coquettish, or suggestive. Used here to describe the lingerie/under-robes.
*   **梅田駅頭 (Umeda Ekitō):** "In front of Umeda Station" (Osaka). This roots the story in a specific, recognizable urban geography.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Price of Survival:** The primary theme is the trade-off between personal freedom and financial survival. Yumi/Kiyoko accepts a "blindfold" and "confinement" in exchange for the money to save a loved one (implied by the sanatorium mention).
*   **The Male Gaze & Objectification:** The protagonist is referred to as a "cute little bird" and is forced to change clothes in a room where a "boy" (steward) enters immediately after she is done. There is a strong subtext of the woman being a "product" for the elite (executives and gentlemen).
*   **Post-War Decadence:** The scene in the room where "gentlemen and wives" are acting in "unbearable" (scandalous) ways reflects a post-war cynicism—the idea that the respectable upper class hides a debauched interior life.
*   **Mystery and "Noir":** The use of blindfolds, secret mansions, and "nightclub secrets" creates a classic noir atmosphere, playing on the reader's fear and curiosity about the hidden worlds of the wealthy.
