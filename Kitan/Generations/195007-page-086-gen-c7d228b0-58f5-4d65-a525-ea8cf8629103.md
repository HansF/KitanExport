## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

い女体が荒れ狂つている。咽せるようなセン情のメロデイ。私は口中に溜つた唾液をどくつと飲み下して主人の顔をのぞき込んだ。
ジャズが急に狂つたように鳴り立てると、夥しく増えた男女の渦が、昔もなく開いた扉の彼方に吸い込まれるように流れ出た。
隣りの部屋には舞台があつてスポット・ライトが明々と舞台の一角を照らし出している。
真ッ白い薄絹のドレスに全身をさらけ出したエキゾツクな混血児が、はち切れそうな腰の線をあらわに、踊り出した。
野性味に溢れる活撥な手肢の躍動。女は一昔流行したドイツの卑猥な淫歌を客に挑みかかるように歌いながら、ドレスを漸次舞台上に投げた。肩にかけられた真珠の首飾りがきらりと光つた。
女は汗ばんだ肌で舞台を下りてテーブルの間を歩き廻ると、皎々たるライトを全身に浴びて男達の前で踊り狂つた。まるで人魚の再来かと危ぶまれる程の妖艶さ。
狂燥なジャズの音にのつて美女たちは満顔の媚笑を投げかけて若鮎のように跳躍する。
彫りの深い美女の浮き彫りが、舞台一杯に淫欲の構図を刻み込んで歓楽の修羅場は最高潮に達するのだつた。
踊りは終つた。
スポット・ライトは消えた。
周りのネオンも徐々に消えて、死の様な静けさが、人間愛愁の姿を現出した。

一瞬、私の脳裡に、負傷者が呻吟する野戦病院の光景が蘇つた。
次々に運び込まれる重傷者の救いを求める呻き声、断末魔の悲鳴、頭を割られた者、腕を飛ばした者。私は血まみれになつて、應急処置を施していた。
「あゝ」
私は歎息してマスターの顔を窺つた。流石中年過ぎた彼の顔にも脂汗がにじみ出ているのか、淡いネオンの光りにテラ〜と光つている。
「君、驚くのはまだ早いよ。もつと、もつと凄い場面がこの奥で展開されているのだよ。」
私は主人の後について廊下に出た、丁度放送室のような、ふんわりとした絨緞の感触が快く足に感じる。壁も部屋の中も、すべて防音装置が完全に施されてあつて、如何に騒いでも外界へ洩れる気遣いがないのだ。否この川底の地下であつて見れば尚更その憂いはない筈である。
いくつにも仕切られた部屋、そこには埋れるような大きなダブルベットが横つており、その背後には化粧台と三面鏡が底知れる光りを湛えて妖しい姿態を反射する。
すべての調度は紫檀を用いて一流の高級ホテルの一室にも負けぬものである。
酒池肉林という言葉は、この場面を表現するために作られたかと思われる地下秘密境の有様であつた。

三、
私はその夜から幾日間もの間、中々落ち着かなかつた。レトルトやフラスコのきららかな輝きの中に、あのネオン輝やく地下のクラブで繰り広げられる情痴の数々がスクリーンのクローズアップのように眼前に追つて来るのだつた。
そんな思いに頭も乱れている私の前には今日も十八ばかりの若い女が、今宵の愛欲の調べを奏でるかのように、検診台の上に肉感的な体臭をふりまいてゆくのだつた。
歓楽の果てた帰り際の媚態は最早私には堪え切れない妖美というより凄惨なものであつた。
一週間に一人か二人は性病が発見された。そんな時の女の悲歎は見ておれなかつた。

（挿絵内テキスト）
このクラブで受けたものかそれとも外の仇し男に罹れたものか私の覗い知る所ではなかつたが、真ッ白い臀部にペニシリンの筋注に唆り泣く女の姿は哀れであつた。
「先生、何時治るの？一ヶ月もかつたら私困つてしまうわ」

Young female body raging is. Choking-like sensational melody. I, inside mouth accumulated saliva gulpingly swallowed and master's face peered into.

Pure white thin silk dress in whole body exposed exotic mixed-blood child, bursting-like waist line revealing, began dancing.
Wildness-overflowing active limbs' movement. Woman, one-era-ago popular Germany's obscene lewd-song to guests challenging-like singing while, dress gradually stage onto threw. Shoulder on hung pearl necklace glitteringly shone.

Frantic jazz sound riding beautiful-women full-faced coquettish-smiles throwing young-sweetfish-like leap.
Deeply-carved beautiful-woman's relief, stage-full lust's composition carving-in pleasure's carnage peak reached it-was.
Dance ended.
Spot-light extinguished.
Surroundings' neon also gradually disappearing, death-like silence, human sorrow's form manifested.

One moment, my brain-inside, injured-people moaning field-hospital scene revived.
One-after-another carried-in serious-injured-people's help-seeking moans, death-agony screams, head split person, arm blown-off person. I blood-smeared becoming, emergency treatment performing was.
"Ah..."
I sighed and master's face observed. As expected middle-age passed his face also greasy-sweat oozing-out is-it, faint neon light in glisteningly shining is.
"You, being-surprised is still early. More, more amazing scenes this back-in being-unfolded are."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

A young woman's body writhes in a frenzy. A stifled, sensational melody fills the air. I swallowed the saliva pooling in my mouth and peered into the Master’s face. As the jazz suddenly reached a fever pitch, the swelling vortex of men and women flowed out through the wide-open doors as if being sucked into the beyond.

In the adjacent room was a stage, one corner of it bathed in the brilliant glow of a spotlight. An exotic girl of mixed heritage, her body draped in nothing but a dress of sheer white silk that revealed the curves of her bursting hips, began to dance. With the vigorous, wild movements of her limbs, she sang a lewd German song popular years ago, as if taunting the guests, while gradually tossing her dress onto the stage. The pearls around her neck flashed in the light. Her skin slick with sweat, she descended from the stage to weave between the tables, dancing madly before the men under the dazzling lights. She was so bewitchingly beautiful she seemed like a mermaid reborn. To the frantic rhythm of the jazz, the beauties leapt like young trout, casting coquettish smiles. The deep features of these women etched a composition of pure lust across the stage, bringing this carnage of pleasure to its absolute zenith.

Then, the dance ended. The spotlight died. The surrounding neon faded, and a deathly silence revealed the true face of human sorrow.

In that instant, a scene from a field hospital where the wounded lay moaning flashed through my mind. The groans of the seriously injured crying for help, the screams of the dying, those with split skulls or severed arms—I was there, drenched in blood, performing emergency surgery.
"Ah..."
I sighed and looked at the Master. Even on his aging face, a greasy sweat seemed to ooze, glistening under the faint neon light.
"You're surprised too early," he said. "Even more incredible scenes are unfolding further back."

I followed him into the corridor. The soft carpet felt pleasant beneath my feet, much like the floor of a broadcasting studio. The walls and the rooms were all perfectly soundproofed; no matter how much noise was made, there was no fear of it leaking to the outside. Indeed, being in a basement beneath a riverbed, such worries were non-existent. We passed several partitioned rooms containing massive double beds that one could sink into. Behind them, vanity tables and three-sided mirrors reflected bewitching figures in their deep, mysterious light. All the furnishings were made of rosewood, rivaling the suites of a first-class luxury hotel. It was a secret underground world that seemed to give literal meaning to the phrase "an orgy of excess."

3.
For several days after that night, I could not settle my mind. Amidst the clean brilliance of my lab's retorts and flasks, the scenes of infatuation from that neon-lit underground club kept flashing before my eyes like cinematic close-ups. Distracted by these thoughts, I watched as another young woman, perhaps eighteen years old, spread her sensual scent across my examination table today, as if still playing the melody of tonight's desires. The coquettishness she displayed as she left after her night of pleasure was, to me, less an unbearable beauty and more something ghastly. Once or twice a week, we would discover a case of venereal disease. I could hardly bear to witness the grief of the women when they received the news.

(Caption)
Whether she contracted it at this club or from some lover on the outside, I did not know. But it was a pitiful sight to see her sobbing as I administered a penicillin injection into her snow-white buttocks.
"Doctor, when will I be cured? If it takes a month, I’ll be in real trouble."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The text is arranged in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left. The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page features a large, provocative illustration at the bottom left, which serves as a visual hook. The text is broken into numbered sections (the start of section "3" is visible), suggesting a serialized story or a multi-part essay.
*   **Illustration:** The drawing depicts a woman in a state of undress, bound with ropes (*shibari*). This is a hallmark of the *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque) genre. The lines are thin and sketch-like, typical of magazine illustrations of the era.
*   **Page Numbering:** The number "87" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger publication.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Use of repetition for emphasis (テラ〜) and specific punctuation like the dash and the tilde to indicate prolonged sounds or visual effects.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The "Kasutori" Era:** This text likely originates from a *kasutori* magazine. These were cheap, low-quality magazines that flourished in Japan during the Allied Occupation (1945–1952). The name comes from a low-grade shochu; just as the drink made you sick after three cups, these magazines were said to fold after three issues. They focused on "3S" topics: Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports (or Sensation).
*   **Post-War Trauma:** The narrator’s flashback to a "field hospital" (野戦病院) with horrific injuries (split heads, severed limbs) is a direct reference to the recent trauma of World War II. The juxtaposition of decadent night club life with the gore of the battlefield is a common theme in post-war literature (the *Buraiha* school).
*   **Penicillin:** Mentioned in the caption, penicillin was the "miracle drug" introduced to Japan by the US occupation forces. It was revolutionary for treating venereal diseases (STDs), which were rampant in the "Pan-pan" (prostitution) districts.
*   **Exoticism & Race:** The mention of a "mixed-race child" (混血児) and "German obscene songs" reflects the international presence in post-war Japan (Western soldiers and the cultural influence of the West).
*   **Underground Clubs:** After the war, many illegal or semi-legal "cabarets" and clubs operated in the ruins of cities, often in basements to avoid noise complaints and police raids.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **扇情 (Senjō):** Sensational, suggestive, or inflammatory. Used here to describe the music.
*   **混血児 (Konketsuji):** A person of mixed race. In the post-war context, this often referred to children of Japanese women and occupation soldiers.
*   **修羅場 (Shuraba):** Originally a Buddhist term for a scene of carnage/battlefield. Here it describes the frantic, chaotic energy of the dance floor.
*   **酒池肉林 (Syuchi-nikurin):** An idiom meaning "forest of meat and pond of wine," signifying extreme luxury, debauchery, and carnal excess.
*   **情痴 (Jōchi):** Blind love, infatuation, or sexual folly.
*   **筋注 (Kinchū):** Short for *kinniku chūsha* (intramuscular injection), the standard way penicillin was administered.
*   **仇し男 (Adashi-otoko):** A lover or a man other than one's husband/regular partner; an adulterer.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Contrast of Eros and Thanatos:** The text explicitly links the "raging" life of the nightclub with the "deathly silence" and memories of the war hospital. The narrator, likely a doctor (given the mention of retorts, flasks, and injections), views the decadence through a lens of medical clinicalism and wartime trauma.
*   **Social Decay:** There is an underlying sense of nihilism. The "glamour" of the club is revealed to be a facade for disease (STDs) and economic desperation (the woman worried about how long treatment takes because she needs to work).
*   **The Gaze of the Professional:** The narrator is an observer—first as a soldier/medic, now as a doctor/technician. He is part of this world but emotionally detached, watching the "carnage" with a mixture of fascination and pity.
*   **Gender and Power:** The women are depicted as exotic, powerful performers on stage, but reduced to "pitiful" patients sobbing over injections in the private sphere.
