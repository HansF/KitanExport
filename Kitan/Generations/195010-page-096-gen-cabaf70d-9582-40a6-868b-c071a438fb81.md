「健ちやん、どうする、早う返事をせぬと、先方さまに失禮になるわ、それに昨日も媒酌人の森川さんが見えて、健ちやんはもう年頃やのにまだ色氣がついとらんのやろか、それともひとゝ違つたところがあるのやろかと、それはそれは失禮なこと言いはるねん、うちくやしいたったら、腹が立つてしんぼうでけへんだ……
　どうするねん健ちやん、このひとどこのどこに不足があるのかいな、新地一流の料理屋、堺芳のいとはんの由美子はんや、あんたも、一度見てるか
ら知つとるやろ、うちの稽古に來はる娘さんのなかで一番の別嬪さんやし、氣心も判つているし、えゝ縁談やないか……どうやねん、黙つていてもうわからへん、いつまでも御母さんに心配かけずに、身をかためてくれたらどう……」
　母親の文字榮が、畳の上においた寫眞をみつめながら、パチだこのできた白い指にピースをはさんで、紫の煙をたてながら息子健一の煮えきらぬ態度をなじる。
「どうしたの、ノーかイエスかはつきりしてほしいわ、ひとさまが真録をもつてきてくれるときには相手になつておくもんや……それとも、あんたに意中のひとがあるのかいな……」
　なんとかしてこの縁談をまとめたいと、文字榮は躍起になつている。
「不足なんか、あらへんけれど……」
「そやつたら、なんで結婚する気になつてくれへんの……」
　健一は二階の押入れにかくしてある、コレクション・アーティクルが頭に浮んで、母親の言葉など馬耳東風、鵜の毛でついたほどの刺戟もない。
「それんや、由美子さんとのお話をすすめませ、わて、はよ孫の顔が、みたうおまつさかいになあ……どれ、森川さんに電話して……」
　立とうとする母親の氣配に、
「お母さん待つて下さい、僕は結婚なんかまだ考えていません、第一、生活能力もない僕が結婚するなんて喜劇ですよ、どつかへ就職してからにして下さい」
「あほらしい。サラリーマンになるなど、そんなケチなこと考えんでええがな、結婚して嫁さんを可愛がつてさえいたらよいんや、生活はお母はんの三味線一挺で充分や……」
「まああとにく、まだ早いから断つておいて下さい」

（二）
　健一は強固に断つてしまつた、健一としては、現在のコレクションが妻であり、戀人なのである。これによつて異常な昂奮、かぎりなき愉悦を健一は味つているのだ。
　結婚なんておかしくてする気がなかつた。
　健一は、三十女の年増ざかりにひどく魅力を感じていた。それというのは、母親の盲目的な溺愛にならされて、女を愛するというよりも、愛されて楽しむ受動的なものへと成長していついていたのだつた。
　三十女の匂うような濡れた肉体ろうたけた腰部の躍動に病的な昂奮へとかりたたてられ、これが進展して變態的になつてしまつた。
　健一の公開できぬコレクションの動機をつくつたのは、家へ稽古にくる、新地の藝者、しめこの緋の媚態であつた。
「ぽんぽん、ぽんぽん」
　としめこはくる度に健一の歓心を買うようにつとめ、なにかとまといついた、そのコケツトに富む身のこなし、健一が能動的にでれば崩れ折れてくるような媚態、故意に健一の好奇心を煽るように見せびらかす、緋の腰のもの、その緋の色に眩惑されて、健一のコレクションが病的に昇進していつた。
　しめこの着物の裾からのぞく緋の色を見なかつたら、健一は健康な結婚生活へ突入していたいろに……。

「健ちゃん、どうする？ 早く返事をしないと、先方さまに失礼になるわ。それに昨日も仲人の森川さんが見えて、『健ちゃんはもう年頃なのに、まだ色気が付いていないのだろうか、それとも人と違ったところがあるのだろうか』と、それはそれは失礼なことをおっしゃるの。私、悔しくて、腹が立って辛抱できなかった……。
どうするの、健ちゃん。この人のどこに不足があるのかしら。新地一流の料理屋『堺芳（さかいよし）』のお嬢さんの由美子さんよ。あんたも一度見ているから知っているでしょう。うちの稽古に来る娘さんの中で一番のべっぴんさんだし、気心も分かっているし、良い縁談じゃないの。どうなの？ 黙っていても分からないわ。いつまでもお母さんに心配かけずに、身を固めてくれたらどう……？」
母親の文字栄（もんじえ）が、畳の上に置いた写真を見つめながら、ペンだこのできた白い指にピース（タバコ）を挟んで、紫の煙を立てながら、息子・健一の煮え切らない態度をなじる。
「どうしたの？ ノーかイエスかはっきりしてほしいわ。人様が誠意を持ってきてくれる時には、相手になっておくものよ……。それとも、あんたに意中の人がいるのかしら……」
なんとかしてこの縁談をまとめたいと、文字栄は躍起になっている。
「不足なんか、ないけれど……」
「それなら、なんで結婚する気になってくれないの……」
健一は二階の押し入れに隠してある、コレクション・アイテムが頭に浮かんで、母親の言葉など馬耳東風、鵜の毛で突いたほどの刺激もない。
「それじゃあ、由美子さんとのお話を進めるわね。私、早く孫の顔が見たいのだから……。どれ、森川さんに電話して……」
立とうとする母親の気配に、
「お母さん、待ってください。僕は結婚なんかまだ考えていません。第一、生活能力もない僕が結婚するなんて喜劇ですよ。どこかへ就職してからにしてください」
「阿呆らしい。サラリーマンになるなんて、そんなケチなこと考えなくていいのよ。結婚して奥さんを可愛がってさえいればいいの。生活はお母さんの三味線一挺で十分よ……」
「まあ、とにかく、まだ早いから断っておいてください」

（二）
健一は強硬に断ってしまった。健一としては、現在のコレクションが妻であり、恋人なのである。これによって異常な興奮、限りなき愉悦を健一は味わっているのだ。
結婚なんておかしくてする気がなかった。
健一は、三十代の女盛りの女性にひどく魅力を感じていた。それというのは、母親の盲目的な溺愛に慣らされて、女を愛するというよりも、愛されて楽しむ受動的なものへと成長していたのだった。
三十代の女性の匂い立つような濡れた肉体、しなやかな腰部の躍動に病的な興奮へと駆り立てられ、これが進展して変態的になってしまった。
健一の公開できないコレクションの動機を作ったのは、家へ稽古に来る、新地の芸者・しめ子の緋色（ひいろ）の媚態であった。
「ぽんぽん、ぽんぽん」
としめ子は来る度に健一の関心を買うように努め、なにかとまといついた。そのコケット（色っぽさ）に富む身のこなし、健一が能動的に出れば崩れ落ちてくるような媚態、故意に健一の好奇心を煽るように見せびらかす、緋色の腰巻（こしまき）。その緋の色に幻惑されて、健一のコレクションが病的にエスカレートしていった。
しめ子の着物の裾から覗く緋の色を見なかったら、健一は健康な結婚生活へ突入していただろうに……。

健一は、城東線や近鉄の高架線に乗るのが好きだった。走る電車の窓からも見える。遠く近くの家々の物干し台、そこには風に吹かれて……

Ken-ichi strongly refused. Ken-ichi as-for, current collection wife is, lover is. This by abnormal excitement, limitless pleasure Ken-ichi tasting is.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**(1)**
"Ken, what are you going to do? If you don't give an answer soon, it will be an insult to the other party. Even the matchmaker, Mr. Morikawa, came by yesterday and said some incredibly rude things—wondering if you were just late to bloom or if there was 'something different' about you. I was so frustrated and angry I could hardly stand it!
What is it, Ken? What could possibly be wrong with this girl? She’s Yumiko, the daughter from Sakai-yoshi, a top-tier restaurant in Shinchi. You’ve seen her, so you know. She’s the most beautiful girl among those who come here for lessons, and we already know her temperament. It’s a perfect match, isn’t it? Say something; I can't tell what you're thinking if you stay silent. Why don't you stop worrying your mother and finally settle down?"
His mother, Monjie, stared at the photograph laid out on the tatami. Holding a Peace cigarette between her white fingers—calloused from playing the shamisen—she exhaled a plume of purple smoke and rebuked her son Ken-ichi for his lukewarm attitude.
"Well? I want a clear 'yes' or 'no.' When someone brings you such a sincere offer, you should at least give them a proper response. Or is there someone else you have your heart set on?"
Monjie was desperate to see this engagement through.
"It’s not that there’s anything wrong with her..."
"Then why won't you agree to marry her?"
Ken-ichi’s mind drifted to the "collection items" hidden in the closet upstairs. His mother's words were like water off a duck's back; they didn't prick his conscience in the slightest.
"In that case, I'll go ahead with the talk with Yumiko. I’m dying to see my grandchild’s face... Now, let me call Mr. Morikawa..."
Sensing his mother was about to get up, Ken-ichi interjected.
"Mother, wait. I’m not thinking about marriage yet. Besides, it would be a joke for someone like me, who can't even support himself, to get married. Please wait until I've found a job somewhere."
"Don't be ridiculous. Don't worry about petty things like becoming a salaryman. All you have to do is get married and dote on your wife. My shamisen playing alone is more than enough to support us..."
"Look, just... it's too early, so please just turn them down for now."

**(2)**
Ken-ichi refused adamantly. For him, his current collection was his wife and his lover. Through it, he experienced an abnormal level of excitement and boundless pleasure.
The very idea of marriage felt absurd to him.
Ken-ichi felt a powerful attraction to women in their thirties, the prime of their womanhood. Having been raised on his mother's blind doting, he had grown into a passive creature who preferred being loved to doing the loving.
The sight of a thirty-year-old woman’s fragrant, supple body and the movement of her graceful hips drove him into a state of morbid excitement, which eventually evolved into a full-blown perversion.
The catalyst for Ken-ichi’s secret collection was the scarlet-hued coquetry of Shimeko, a geisha from Shinchi who came to the house for lessons.
"Pon-pon, pon-pon," the shamisen went.
Every time Shimeko visited, she tried to win Ken-ichi’s favor, clinging to him with coquettish movements. Whenever he showed even a hint of initiative, she would act as if she were melting into him. She would intentionally flaunt her scarlet *koshimaki* (underskirt) to fan his curiosity. Dazzled by that vibrant scarlet, Ken-ichi’s collecting habit grew into a pathology.
If he had never seen that flash of scarlet peeking from the hem of Shimeko’s kimono, Ken-ichi might have entered into a normal, healthy marriage.

**(3)**
Ken-ichi loved riding the Joto and Kintetsu elevated train lines. From the windows of the moving train, he could see the laundry drying racks of houses near and far. There, fluttering in the wind...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is structured in a classic Japanese vertical (tategaki) layout, read from right to left. It is divided into three numbered sections: (一), (二), and (三).
*   **Typography:** 
    *   The title "**変態遺伝コレクション 女の腰巻を蒐める男**" (Abnormal Heredity Collection: The Man Who Collects Women's Underskirts) uses a bold, slightly stylized font to grab attention, typical of sensationalist pulp magazines.
    *   The author's name, **兵庫 一平** (Hyogo Ippei), is placed prominently below the title.
    *   The illustrator's credit **（絵）三は** is found near the bottom.
*   **Visual Elements:** A central illustration depicts a woman hanging laundry (specifically a *koshimaki*) while a man (Ken-ichi) watches with a wide-eyed, intense expression. The illustration is simple, ink-drawn, and characteristic of the "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) aesthetic of the era.
*   **Columns:** The text flows in columns that are occasionally broken by the title and the illustration, creating a dynamic but cluttered feel common in mass-market periodicals of the early Showa post-war period.
*   **Pagination:** The number (96) at the bottom indicates the page number in the magazine.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Magazines:** The content, tone, and visual style strongly suggest a "Kasutori" magazine. These were cheap, pulp-fiction magazines that flourished in Japan immediately after WWII (late 1940s). They specialized in "three S's": Speed, Sensationalism, and Sex. The name comes from *kasutori* shochu (dregs liquor), implying the magazines were "cheap, intoxicating, and left you with a bad hangover."
*   **The Scarlet Koshimaki:** The *koshimaki* is a traditional wraparound underskirt worn under a kimono. Traditionally, bright scarlet (*hi*) was the color worn by young women or geishas, symbolizing fertility and vitality. In early 20th-century Japanese literature and psychology, it became a potent fetish object.
*   **Shinchi (新地):** Refers to "Kita-shinchi" in Osaka, a famous entertainment and former red-light district. Mentioning a "Shinchi geisha" or a restaurant like "Sakai-yoshi" sets the story in the urban merchant culture of Osaka.
*   **Post-War Oedipal Themes:** The story touches on the "Mother Complex" (Maza-kon), which was a common psychological theme in post-war literature—men who were over-indulged by their mothers and struggled with adult masculine roles.
*   **"Abnormal Heredity" (変態遺伝):** The term reflects a pseudo-scientific fascination with "perversions" common in the early 20th century, often blending early psychology with sensationalist fiction.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **蒐める (Atsumeru):** An archaic/literary kanji for "collect" (usually 集める). Using the more complex kanji adds a "maniacal" or "curio-collecting" nuance.
*   **別嬪 (Beppin):** A beautiful woman. This term is particularly associated with the Kansai/Osaka dialect.
*   **いとはん (Ito-han):** An Osaka dialect term for the daughter of a wealthy merchant family.
*   **文字栄 (Monjie):** The mother's name. "Monji" is a rare surname, and "Ei" (Prosperity) is a classic female name element.
*   **ピース (Peace):** A high-end Japanese cigarette brand launched in 1946. It was a symbol of luxury in the impoverished post-war years.
*   **馬耳東風 (Baji-tofu):** An idiom meaning "utter indifference" or "like the east wind in a horse's ear."
*   **鵜の毛でついたほど (U-no-ke de tsuita hodo):** An idiom meaning "the slightest bit" (literally: as if pricked by a cormorant's hair).
*   **媚態 (Bitai):** Coquetry, seductive behavior, or "flirtatious charms."
*   **コケット (Coquette):** A loanword from French/English, often used in Japanese pulp to describe a woman who is flirtatious in a sophisticated way.
*   **城東線 (Joto-sen):** The old name for the JR Osaka Loop Line (East side).

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Fetishism as Escape:** The protagonist finds more fulfillment in his secret collection of women's undergarments than in actual human relationships or the prospect of marriage. The "collection" represents a safe, controllable substitute for the complexities of a real woman.
*   **Passive Masculinity:** Ken-ichi is described as having "no life ability" (no job) and being content to live off his mother's earnings. This mirrors the post-war "sun-tribe" or "dandy" anxiety where traditional masculine roles were in flux.
*   **The Forbidden Gaze:** Section (三) introduces voyeurism. The elevated train provides a vantage point into private spaces (the drying racks), allowing him to satisfy his fetish from a distance.
*   **The Scarlet Obsession:** The color red/scarlet (緋) is used repeatedly to symbolize the "morbid" or "sickly" nature of his obsession. It acts as the visual trigger that derails him from a "healthy" life.
*   **Dialect and Class:** The use of Osaka dialect (*~han*, *~yaro*, *~ma-sakai*) grounds the story in a specific urban merchant-class milieu, contrasting the traditional art of the shamisen with the modern perversion of the son.
