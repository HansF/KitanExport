## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**18/19**
From that night, his figure, in the woman's house inner parlor, could be seen.
That, for some reason, time was limited. From 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock, one *ikki* (approx. 2 hours) or more, staying did not happen. Rather than saying it didn't happen, it was that he could not.
During that one *ikki*, while warming at the kotatsu, being made to drink sake, and then like a cat, by the woman, he had to be pampered.
"This time for sure!" so Fujibei also, in the beginning, a certain expectation was holding, but lately, already such hope discarded, as the woman ordered, he was taking action.

**21**
Although it was a matter of being loathed, on nights when the woman's teasing went too far, his anxiety mounted to the extreme and would not stop.
But, always, when it reached that point, from nowhere, "pon-pon" a person clapping hands existed.

**22**
Indeed, it was to the extent one could only think it was someone peeping from the next room; always at the moment his emotions reached their peak, those hands would sound.
Hearing that, the woman immediately stood up and went, and to that place again did not return. Exhausted to a pulp, he, urged by the maidservant, dejectedly had to leave that house.

**23**
Since starting to frequent this house, he visibly emaciated, and eyes were dully clouded.
However, when the usual time came, as if pulled by a rope, to the woman's house he went.
One morning, Fujibei, at the Jizobashi bridge willow tree, having become cold, was hanging.
The woman of Choji-yu, who was worn down by a master nearly seventy and senile, having suddenly lost the "medicine" to satisfy that master's performance, had to search for a second Fujibei.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Sections 18–19**
From that night on, Fujibei was a regular fixture in the inner sanctum of the woman’s house. For reasons unknown, his visits were strictly timed; he never stayed longer than the two-hour window between the hour of the Sheep and the hour of the Monkey. It wasn't so much that he chose to leave, but rather that he was permitted no longer. During that brief interval, he would warm himself at the kotatsu, ply himself with the sake she forced upon him, and endure her fickle ministrations—treated like a pet cat to be toyed with and pampered at her whim. "This time, surely..." he had told himself in the beginning, harboring a desperate hope. But by now, even that hope had withered. He moved only as she commanded, a puppet to her will.

**Section 21**
Though he knew he was being toyed with, on nights when her provocations became too cruel, his agitation would reach a fever pitch. Yet, invariably, just as his passion reached its limit, the silence would be shattered by the sharp *clap-clap* of hands coming from somewhere in the house.

**Section 22**
The timing was so precise it seemed someone must be peeping through the sliding doors from the adjacent room; the signal always came at the exact moment his emotions reached their crescendo. Upon hearing it, the woman would rise instantly and vanish, never to return that night. Drained to the point of collapse, Fujibei would be ushered out by a maidservant, forced to leave the house in a state of dejected exhaustion.

**Section 23**
Since he began frequenting her house, Fujibei had wasted away before everyone's eyes, his gaze growing dull and clouded. Yet, as soon as the appointed hour arrived, he would find himself drawn back to her, as if led by an invisible leash.
One morning, Fujibei’s cold body was found hanging from a willow tree at Jizobashi Bridge. The woman, a bathhouse girl from the Choji-yu who was already exhausted by the demands of her nearly seventy-year-old, senile master, had suddenly lost the "resource" she used to satisfy him. She had no choice but to begin her search for the next Fujibei.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a non-linear, dynamic layout typical of mid-century Japanese pictorial storytelling. The text flows around hand-drawn illustrations that are numbered (18 through 23), suggesting a continuing serial.
*   **Typography:** The text is set vertically (tate-gaki). It uses a mix of printed type for the main narrative and hand-written numbers for the panel markers. Furigana (reading aids) are provided for difficult kanji like 悪戯 (itazura), 焦慮 (aseri), and 憔悴 (seusui).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The numbers act as anchors for the reader's eye. The illustrations provide a somber, noir-ish atmosphere, with heavy use of shadows and traditional Japanese motifs (kimono, willow tree, crescent moon).
*   **Column Structure:** The text blocks are somewhat irregular, fitting into the negative space around the artwork.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Time System:** The text mentions "Seven to Eight" (七ツから八ツ). This refers to the traditional Japanese Edo-period time-keeping system. "Seven" (nanatsu) is roughly 4:00 PM, and "Eight" (yatsu) is roughly 2:00 PM (counting backwards) or refers to specific intervals in the evening. Given the "night" context, it suggests a specific shift or window of time allowed for clandestine meetings.
*   **Choji-yu (丁字湯):** This refers to a bathhouse. In the Edo period and through the early 20th century, some bathhouses (specifically *yuna-buro*) were known for employing "bathhouse girls" (*yuna*) who provided sexual services.
*   **Jizobashi (地蔵橋):** A common name for bridges near a Jizo statue. Willow trees (*yanagi*) near bridges are a classic trope in Japanese ghost stories and tragedies (the "suicide at the willow" motif).
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The dark, slightly erotic, and tragic tone is characteristic of "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, pulp publications popular in Japan during the post-WWII occupation. They often dealt with themes of the "underworld," desperation, and the breakdown of traditional morals.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **炬燵 (Kotatsu):** A traditional Japanese foot warmer with a quilt. Here it symbolizes a false sense of domestic intimacy.
*   **ちやほや (Chiyahoya):** To pamper or make a fuss over someone. Usually has a connotation of being treated like a pet or a child.
*   **焦慮 (Aseri/Shoryo):** Intense anxiety or impatience. The furigana "aseri" is the kun-yomi reading.
*   **隙見 (Sukimi):** Peeping or voyeurism.
*   **悄然 (Shozen):** Dejectedly, despondently.
*   **憔悴 (Seusui/Shousui):** Becoming emaciated or worn out from worry or illness.
*   **性能 (Seinou):** Usually means "performance" or "efficiency" (as in a machine). Its use here in the context of an old man's sexual "performance" is a somewhat clinical or euphemistic objectification.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Predatory Power Dynamics:** The woman is not just a lover but a predator. She uses Fujibei as a "medicine" (resource) to satisfy her elderly master, essentially "draining" him of his life force.
*   **Fatalism and Obsession:** Despite knowing he is being destroyed, Fujibei is "pulled as if by a rope." This reflects the Buddhist concept of *innen* (karma) or *shūchaku* (attachment) that leads to ruin.
*   **The "Vampiric" Woman:** The ending reveals the woman's cold pragmatism. She doesn't mourn Fujibei; she simply views him as a lost tool that needs to be replaced. This fits the "Femme Fatale" archetype of post-war noir.
*   **Isolation:** The "clapping hands" suggest a hidden observer or a pimp-like figure controlling the encounter, highlighting Fujibei's lack of agency even in his most private moments.
