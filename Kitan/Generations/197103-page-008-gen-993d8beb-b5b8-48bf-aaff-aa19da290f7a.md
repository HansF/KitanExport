## Output

```
This text is a sophisticated piece of meta-commentary from the legendary magazine *Kitan Club* (奇譚クラブ). It appears to be a reader's letter or a regular column (likely "Tōrō no Ono" / The Mantis’s Hatchet) critiquing the current state of "Abu" (Abnormal/Fetish) fiction. The author argues that professional writers often lack the raw, visceral "physicality" that amateur or specialized writers bring to the genre.

## 2️⃣ Normalized Japanese (現代仮名遣い)

稚気あふれる御仁が「世間の今更ながらの風潮は、我々のような古くからのKK読者の目から見れば、おかしくて、吹き出したくなる」とか、本当に吹き出したくなるようなおかしな自慢たらたらで、「プロ作家には筆力あれども内容がなく、本誌傘下の作家陣には内容あれども表現力なしと、双方ともに相足らざる嘆きがある」とか、的外れの許され難い冒涜的な評を下し、「目が肥えてくるとニセモノとホンモノの区別がちゃんとついてくる」とか再び訳の分からぬ自慢たらたら、お気に召すまま言うまま気ままに駄弁っていたが、全く、恐れ入って、座りションベンをちびりそうになった。

　まあ、ご本人氏は、悪気があって言ったのではないと思うが、いささか病的な言であり、悪質な評ではあった。何なら、ひとつご自分で“ホンモノのアブ小説”とやらを書いてほしいものだ。僕の見た限りではプロ作家の多くは本誌にはあまり見られぬような、実にメンタリティーに富んだアブ（アブノーマル）を描いているし、反対に、本誌傘下の作家にだって、単なるアブ小説を書かすにはもったいないほど全てに通じた高級な作家がいる。

　例えば、宇光仙氏だが、氏の作品は感性的過ぎる、という誹謗を浴びせる向きもままあろうが、これこそアブの極致だと僕は思うし、でなくとも、個々の描写は存外フィジカルな描写をしているし、常に研ぎ澄まされた考察なり思想なりが潜んでいるし、表現力にしてもチンケな大衆作家など下駄を脱いで駆け出すほどだし、スタイルなども細密でロジカルで力強いし、芳野眉美氏の作品などは、極めて男性的（フィジカルかつ、ロジカル）で隙がないし、「青春の陥穽」など実に精緻な伏線を張り誰が読んでもついつい首肯せざるを得なくなるような必然性の高いプロットを組むし、そのうえオジサンとは思えぬほどの瑞々しい感覚や詩的な情感を散りばめるし、折りふしに飛び出す「考察」や「学問」やウィット等の価値たるや、これまた大であるし、その他の作家連についても、真砂氏、千葉氏、千草氏、鬼山氏、浅羽氏などなど、挙げればキリがないし、一晩や二晩では語り尽くせないものがある。とにかく、僕は本誌の作家陣が“筆力に乏しい”などとは、どう見ても思えないし、ちっとも思わないし、全然思ったこともない。まあ、それほど力を入れて読まないからかもしれないが、筆力があるかないかぐらいは、パラパラ拾い読みしただけでも分かるはずだ。

　大体「プロ作家とは筆力があるもの、アマ作家は表現力に乏しいもの」なんていう妙な先入観を持って読むから、妙な評価を下すんですよ。音楽や文学や絵画などのいわゆる、芸術と呼ばれるものには、プロもアマもない。唯一、それをメシの種にしているか否か、だけだ。田舎のおばさんが一躍、ベストセラーの大文学を出すでしょう。

　早い話が、プロ作家の、我らが鬼六の「花と蛇」にしても、そりゃあ、どこやらがムズムズしてくるほど最高だとは思うけど、僕の場合、その“最高”はサワリ（見どころ）の描写についてのみ言えることで、言うほどの小説ではないと思っている。責めのための責め小説という感じしか受けない。たまにはヘンテコリンな隙を作ってシラケさせてもくださる。一例を挙げれば「甲の身代わりを乙が買って出る」などの手法をよく使うようだが、いささか軟弱に思える。人間なんて奴は逆境の真っ只中にいる時には、たとえ親兄弟といえども容易に顧みないものだ。おまけに彼女たちの助け合い運動は、京子と美津子を除いては全て血縁のない他人相互間になされている。放恣三昧に育った高慢ちきな令夫人や令嬢や現代っ子たちが一様（に…）

## 3️⃣ Literal English Translation

A gentleman full of childishness [said], "The current social trends, from the eyes of long-time KK readers like us, are so funny they make me want to burst out laughing," and other such absurd boasts that truly make one want to burst out laughing. He gave offhand, unforgivable, and blasphemous critiques such as, "Professional writers have pen-power but no content, while the writers under this magazine's umbrella have content but no power of expression—a lamentable lack on both sides," and "As one's eyes become more refined, one can properly distinguish between the fake and the real." He went on babbling as he pleased, but honestly, I was so taken aback I almost wet myself sitting down.

Well, I don't think the person themselves meant any harm, but it was a somewhat pathological statement and a malicious critique. If that's the case, I’d like to see them try to write a "genuine Abu [abnormal] novel" themselves. As far as I can see, many professional writers describe a psychological brand of "Abu" rarely seen in this magazine, while conversely, among the writers under this magazine’s umbrella, there are high-class authors so well-versed in everything that it's a waste to have them write mere Abu stories.

Take, for instance, Mr. Ukō-sen; though some might hurl slander saying his works are too emotional, I believe this is the very pinnacle of Abu. Even if not, his individual descriptions are unexpectedly physical, and there is always a sharpened observation or ideology lurking within. As for his power of expression, it's enough to make cheap popular novelists take off their clogs and run away. His style is detailed, logical, and strong. The works of Mayumi Yoshino, for example, are extremely masculine (physical and logical) and without gaps. In "The Trap of Youth," they lay such exquisite foreshadowing that anyone reading it can’t help but nod in agreement at the highly inevitable plot. Furthermore, they sprinkle in a freshness of sense and poetic emotion that one wouldn't expect from an "old guy." The value of the "observations," "erudition," and "wit" that pop up occasionally is also great. Regarding the other writers—Mr. Masago, Mr. Chiba, Mr. Chigusa, Mr. Oniyama, Mr. Asaba, and so on—there is no end to them; they are things that couldn't be fully discussed in a night or two. Anyway, I cannot see, not even a bit, and have never once thought that the writers of this magazine "lack pen-power." Well, maybe it's because I don't read with that much intensity, but one should be able to tell whether there is pen-power or not just by flipping through and skimming.

In the first place, people give strange evaluations because they read with the odd prejudice that "professional writers are those with pen-power, and amateur writers are those lacking expressive power." In what is called art—be it music, literature, or painting—there is no professional or amateur. The only difference is whether or not one makes a living from it. A lady from the countryside can suddenly put out a best-selling work of great literature, can't she?

To put it simply, even regarding our own Oniroku's "Flower and Snake" (Hana to Hebi)—while I think it's the best to the point where "certain parts" start to itch—in my case, that "best" applies only to the description of the *sawari* (the climax/erotic hook). I don't think it's a novel worth as much as people say. I only get the impression of a "torture-for-torture's-sake" novel. Sometimes he creates weird gaps that make me lose interest. To give an example, he often uses the technique where "Person A offers to take the place of Person B," but that seems a bit weak [unrealistic]. Humans are creatures that, when in the midst of adversity, do not easily look back even upon their own parents or siblings. Moreover, their "mutual aid movement" is carried out entirely between unrelated strangers, with the exception of Kyoko and Mitsuko. Arrogant high-born ladies and daughters and "modern girls" who were raised in total self-indulgence all uniformly...

**The Mantis’s Hatchet**

Some childish fellow recently remarked, "To a veteran *Kitan Club* reader like me, current social trends are so absurd they’re laughable." He continued with a string of self-important boasts that were, in truth, the only things worth laughing at. He offered the dismissive and borderline blasphemous critique that "professional authors have the technique but no substance, while this magazine’s writers have the substance but no technique—a tragedy of mutual inadequacy." He went on to blather about how "a refined eye eventually learns to distinguish the authentic from the sham." Honestly, his arrogance was so overwhelming I nearly pissed myself in shock.

Now, I don’t believe the gentleman intended any malice, but his words were somewhat pathological and certainly spiteful. If he’s so confident, I’d like to see him try his hand at writing a "genuine abnormal novel" himself. From my perspective, many professional authors explore a psychological depth of "Abu" (the abnormal) rarely found here. Conversely, within our own stable of writers, we have high-caliber authors whose talents are far too vast to be squandered on simple fetish pulp.

Consider Ukō-sen. Some may slander his work as being overly sentimental, but I maintain it is the very zenith of the genre. His descriptions possess a surprising physicality, underpinned by sharp insight and ideology. His expressive power is so formidable it would send hack pop-novelists running for the hills. Then there is Mayumi Yoshino, whose work is intensely "masculine"—logical, physical, and airtight. In pieces like *The Trap of Youth*, the plotting is so meticulously foreshadowed that the reader is compelled to accept its inevitability. Moreover, Yoshino imbues the prose with a poetic sensibility and a youthful freshness one wouldn't expect from an older man. The erudition and wit that surface in these stories are of immense value. As for the rest—Masago, Chiba, Chigusa, Oniyama, Asaba—the list is endless. I could spend nights discussing them. I simply cannot fathom the claim that our writers "lack pen-power." Perhaps I’m just a casual reader, but one doesn't need to study a page to recognize talent; a mere glance is enough.

The problem lies in the prejudice that "professionals have skill while amateurs lack expression." In art—whether music, painting, or letters—such distinctions are meaningless. The only difference is whether the work puts food on the table. A housewife from the provinces can produce a masterpiece of literature just as easily as a veteran.

Take our very own Dan Oniroku. His *Flower and Snake* is certainly "the best" in the sense that it makes certain parts of the anatomy tingle, but for me, that excellence is limited to the erotic highlights. As a novel, it’s overrated. It feels like a "torture for the sake of torture" story. He often loses me with bizarre, unrealistic plot holes—such as the recurring trope where one character volunteers to take another's punishment. It’s too sentimental. In the cold reality of suffering, humans don't even look back at their own kin, let alone strangers. Yet, with the exception of Kyoko and Mitsuko, these pampered socialites and "Modern Girls" are suddenly depicted engaging in a selfless "mutual aid society" in the face of bondage...

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** This is a "Letter to the Editor" or a "Critic’s Column." Given the title "Tōrō no Ono" (a proverb about a mantis trying to stop a chariot with its claws—i.e., a brave but futile effort), it suggests a defiant stance against mainstream or "snobbish" literary criticism.
*   **Author Attribution:** Unclear, but written in the first person ("Boku" - masculine 'I'). It represents the voice of a "hardcore" *Kitan Club* devotee.
*   **Editorial Voice:** It functions as a defense of the magazine's "house style" against a specific (unnamed) critic who insulted the writers of *Kitan Club*.
*   **Target Audience Signals:** References to "KK" (Kitan Club) and "Abu" (Abnormal) assume a reader deeply familiar with the magazine's lexicon and roster of authors.
*   **Positioning:** Page 11 suggests it’s a lead editorial or a high-priority feedback section, designed to stir debate among the readership.

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

*   **Kitan Club (KK):** Published from 1946 to 1975, it was the vanguard of *ero-guro* and fetish subculture in postwar Japan. It wasn't just "porn"; it was a literary hub for SM (sado-masochism) and "abnormal" interests.
*   **Professional vs. Amateur:** In the 1950s and 60s, a divide existed between "Bungei" (High Literature) and "Kasutori" (Pulp). The author is arguing that "pen-power" (筆力) is a false metric used by elitists.
*   **Dan Oniroku (鬼六):** The most famous author of Japanese bondage fiction. The critique of his masterpiece *Flower and Snake* (Hana to Hebi) is daring—the author argues it is erotic but lacks psychological realism (the "mutual aid" among victims being too idealistic).
*   **"Modern Girls" (現代っ子):** A term used here to describe the spoiled, postwar generation of young women, often contrasted with the "high-born ladies" (令夫人) in SM fantasies.
*   **Swaying/Peeing sitting down (スワリションベン):** A vulgar, humorous idiom for being shocked or laughing so hard one loses control.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Abu (アブ):** Short for "Abnormal" (アブノーマル). In the context of *Kitan Club*, this refers to SM, bondage, and other paraphilias.
*   **筆力 (Hitsuryoku):** Literally "brush power." Refers to literary technique, prose style, and the ability to command language.
*   **メシの種 (Meshi no tane):** Literally "seed for rice." An idiom meaning "one's livelihood" or "way to make a living."
*   **サワリ (Sawari):** Often used today to mean "introduction," but in traditional theater and 20th-century slang, it refers to the "climax," the most moving part, or the "good bits" (often erotic).
*   **責め (Seme):** Torture or "active" role in an SM context.
*   **下駄を脱いで駆け出す (Geta o nuide kakedasu):** To run away in such a hurry one leaves their shoes behind; to be utterly outclassed.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Authenticity vs. Technique:** The core conflict is whether "good" fetish writing requires literary polish or raw, "physical" (フィジカル) truth.
*   **Masculinity in Writing:** The author equates "good" writing with being "logical" and "masculine" (芳野眉美氏の作品などは、極めて男性的), even when discussing eroticism.
*   **Cynicism toward Human Nature:** The author critiques Dan Oniroku for being too "soft" or sentimental, arguing that in true torture/adversity, people are selfish, not altruistic. This reflects a dark, postwar nihilism.
*   **Class Perversion:** The mention of "high-born ladies" (令夫人) and "arrogant daughters" (高慢ちきな令嬢) highlights the class-based fantasies prevalent in Japanese SM (the humbling of the elite).

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** High (Conceptual and literary discussion of SM/bondage).
*   **Violence:** Moderate (Discussion of "torture novels").
*   **Tone:** Polemical, critical, intellectual-pulp.
*   **Ethics/Power:** Focuses on the dynamics of "Seme" (the tormentor) and the realism of victimhood.
