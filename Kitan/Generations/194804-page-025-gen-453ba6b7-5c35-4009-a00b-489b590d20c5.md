も店への借金がかさむばかり。とうとうその頃からの仲良しのおキヨちゃんとしめ合せて飛田をズラかつたのよ。行先はどうせ堅気ぢやなかつた、飛田よりは客の金使いが荒いと聞いていた、今里遊廓だつたの。
　でも、他人の花は赤いと云う通りねえ、借金を踏み倒して肢がえした今里のいまの大新楼だつて、生活の苦しいことは前以上なの。此の中には、せつぱ詰まつて人殺しや強盗をやるものもある。上に立つ政府のえらい人だつて何千万圓の詐欺で擧げられるんだ、ばか〜らしい。なぜあたしたちばかりが、接待婦だの女郎だのと、犬畜生のように罵られなければならないの。
　ある晩、お茶を引いたあたしの部屋で、おキヨちゃんと、もう一人仲良しのオチヅちゃんと三人寄りつて、さんゞ世の中を憤慨したのよ。みんながそんな氣持なら、あたしたちだつてきつとやつてみせる。三人も男の弱點は知りぬいているんだものそれを利用したら、きつと大きな淫ろいお金儲けが出来ることを思いついたのよ。」
　十九の接待婦の頰に、一筋の涙がきらりと光りながら流れていた。江本刑事は、物判りのいゝ伯父のように、こくりと深くうなづいた。
「それで、このごろの遊廓は晝間自由に外出できるから、三人が相談してうまく抜け出し、近所のドブロク屋の二階で素人娘に變装して、地下鐵へ潜りこんだの。十一、十二、一、二、この三ヶ月ほどで、あたしだけでも三四十件は引つかけたわ。おキヨちゃんもチヅちゃんも馴れてきて、ずいぶん凄い荒稼ぎしてるにちがいないわ。」
　告白は終つた。江本刑事は、呆然とこの稀代の女スリ團の妖艶きわまる美貌を見つめた。阪南町の薄暗い横町のわが家で、今ごろつゝましく夕餉の支度に余念なくカンテキを破れ團扇であおいでいるにちがいないやさしい親孝行者として、近所の褒め者となつているわが娘を、刑事はしみゞと思い浮べたのである。
「うち、洗いざらいよく白状してくれたな、それになに、お前たちが接待婦だつて言う素性を、お前たちの戀人の「南の三羽烏」にさえ知らされていないのは何故だ。女郎つことを知られたら、捨てられると心配したからか？」
「江本さん、あなたほどの鋭どい頭脳を持つていらしても、あゝ、男にはやつぱり本當の女心がわかめないものかしら。あたしたちが、あたしが秀ちゃんに、おキヨが定公に、そしてオチヅが友坊に、もう何度も身体を許しながら、でも素性を匿名した理由はね。」
　マサの眼は、この時、うつとりと美しい幸福な夢に輝いていた。
「あたしたちは泥水に染まつた女郎そして秀ちゃんたちは、警察に追われているヨタモノ、どつちも悲しい暗い日影者同士よ。でも、愛しあつていることは、どんな立派な青年や處女の熱情にも負けない純潔なものなの。秀ちゃんがいま死ねと言つたら、あたし喜んで一緒に死ぬわ。何百人となく商賣上で嫌な男に抱かれて来たけれど、本當の戀は生まれて始めてなのよ。そりや、お終いには素性は判つてしまいます、けれど、けれど、好きな戀人と一緒に喫茶店へ入つたり、ダンスホールへ行つたり、ホテルへ泊つたりするときは、あたしたちもやつぱり、こんな接待婦なんかに落ちない前の身体も魂も綺麗な娘に歸りたいのよ。ね、江本さん、そんな幸福に酔つているときどうして接待婦だなんて白状できるものですか。あたしたちだつて夢はあるのよ。ね、江本さん、判つてくださるかしら？」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
Also the debt to the shop only increased. Finally, with the friend from that time, O-Kiyo-chan, conspired and slipped out of Tobita. The destination anyway was not respectable; I had heard that compared to Tobita, customers' money usage was rougher—it was the Imazato Brothel Quarter.

But, as the saying "others' flowers are red" goes, even at the current Daishinrou in Imazato where I moved after jumping my debt, the hardship of life is more than before. Among us, there are those who, being cornered, do killings or robberies. Even the great people in the government sitting on top are caught for tens of millions of yen in fraud; it's ridiculous. Why must only we be cursed like dogs and beasts, called "reception women" or "whores"?

One night, in my room where I had no customers, O-Kiyo-chan, and another good friend O-Chizu-chan, the three of us gathered and were utterly indignant at the world. "If everyone feels that way, we too will certainly show them. We three know men's weak points inside out; if we utilize that, surely we can make big, fruitful money," we thought.

On the cheek of the nineteen-year-old "reception woman," a single streak of tear was flowing while sparkling. Detective Emoto, like an understanding uncle, nodded deeply with a "kokuri."

"So, because brothels these days allow free going out during the day, the three of us consulted and successfully slipped out, disguised ourselves as amateur girls in the second floor of a nearby doburoku [unrefined sake] shop, and dove into the subway. In these about three months—November, December, January, February—I alone hooked thirty or forty cases. O-Kiyo-chan and Chizu-chan too have gotten used to it and must be making a quite amazing killing."

The confession ended. Detective Emoto stared blankly at the bewitchingly beautiful appearance of this rare female pickpocket gang. In his mind, the detective vividly pictured his own daughter, who at his home in a dim alley of Hannan-cho, must be single-mindedly preparing the evening meal, fanning the *kanteki* [charcoal stove] with a torn fan, being praised by neighbors as a gentle, filial person.

"You have confessed everything well to me. Besides, why is it that you haven't even told your lovers, the 'Three Crows of the South,' your true identity as reception women? Was it because you worried you'd be abandoned if they knew you were whores?"

"Mr. Emoto, even though you have such a sharp brain, ah, can men after all not understand a woman's true heart? The reason why we—I to Hide-chan, O-Kiyo to Sada-ko, and O-Chizu to Tomo-bo—while having given our bodies many times, still concealed our identities is..."

Masa's eyes at this time were shining in an entranced, beautiful, happy dream.

"We are whores stained in muddy water, and Hide-chan and the others are 'yota-mono' [delinquents] being chased by the police; both are sad, dark outcasts. But the fact that we love each other is a pure thing that doesn't lose to the passion of any fine young man or virgin. If Hide-chan told me to die now, I would happily die together. I've been held by hundreds of men I disliked for business, but a true love is the first time since I was born. Well, in the end, the identity will be found out, but, but, when entering a cafe with a favorite lover, or going to a dance hall, or staying at a hotel, we too, after all, want to return to being the girls with clean bodies and souls before we fell into being such reception women. Hey, Mr. Emoto, when drunk on such happiness, how could we confess being reception women? Even we have dreams. Hey, Mr. Emoto, do you understand?"

4. Hanshin Kasuri [Pickpocket]
   The End of a Family

Early morning, February 13th, a party of plainclothes police officers commanded by Detective Emoto dropped the net of a swift and daring mass arrest over the whole Abeno-bashi area!

From the Imazato Brothel Daishinrou, it goes without saying that the two, Kiyoko Yoimura and Chizu Kawada, were taken away in disheveled sleeping attire.

Pan-pan [prostitutes], male prostitutes, gamblers, hoodlum pickpockets, junk dealers—the small fry running hither and thither were caught in the arrest net in great numbers. But the biggest "large fish," the "Three Crows of the South," skillfully escaped again this time.

"Alright! I will fight to the end. Just you see, as long as this Emoto's eyes are black [as long as I live], the nest of evil in this Abeno neighborhood will be thoroughly washed out and crushed!"

For the sake of justice and public order, the cheeks of Detective Emoto, who had entered the underworld of knives and guns, were burning like a youthful lad's.

February 17th, the article "Enchanting Trio of Beauty Pickpockets 'Hanshin Kasuri' Family Destroyed, Sent to Prosecutor on Suspicion of Theft and Blackmail!" decorated the social pages of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Osaka Shimbun, Jiji Shimpo, and others in huge letters. (The End)

Her debts to the brothel only continued to mount. Finally, she and her close friend O-Kiyo conspired together and fled Tobita. Their destination was hardly respectable; they had heard the customers in the Imazato district were more free with their cash than in Tobita, so they headed for the Imazato red-light district.

Yet, as the saying goes, "the neighbor's grass is always greener." Even at her new post at the Daishinrou in Imazato, life was more grueling than before. Some women there, driven to the brink, turned to murder or robbery. "Even the 'great men' in the government get hauled in for multi-million yen frauds," she spat bitterly. "It’s absurd. Why is it only us who are cursed as 'reception girls' and 'whores,' treated no better than stray dogs?"

One night, in her room during a lull in business, she huddled with O-Kiyo and another friend, O-Chizu. They vented their shared resentment at the world. If everyone felt this way, they decided, they would take matters into their own hands. All three knew the weaknesses of men inside and out. They realized that if they exploited those flaws, they could finally make some real money.

A single tear rolled down the nineteen-year-old girl’s cheek, glinting in the light. Detective Emoto nodded deeply, projecting the air of a sympathetic uncle.

"Brothels these days let you out during the day," she continued, "so the three of us planned our escape. We slipped out, changed into 'straight' clothes on the second floor of a nearby moonshine shop, and vanished into the subway. Over the last few months—from November through February—I alone must have pulled off thirty or forty jobs. O-Kiyo and Chizu got the hang of it too; I’m sure they’ve been making a killing."

The confession ended. Emoto stared blankly at the bewitching beauty of this unprecedented female pickpocket. He couldn't help but picture his own daughter back at their home in the dim alleys of Hannan-cho—a girl praised by the neighbors as a paragon of filial piety, likely fanning the charcoal stove with a tattered fan as she prepared their humble evening meal.

"You've made a clean breast of it," the detective said. "But tell me—why didn't you reveal your identities as prostitutes even to your lovers, the 'Three Crows of the South'? Were you afraid they’d dump you if they knew?"

"Mr. Emoto, for all your sharp wits, do men really understand so little of a woman's heart? We gave our bodies to Hide, Sada, and Tomo over and over, yet we hid the truth because..."

Masa’s eyes glazed over, shining with the light of a fleeting, beautiful dream.

"We are whores stained by the mud, and they are thugs chased by the police. We’re all just tragic outcasts living in the shadows. But our love is as pure as any 'respectable' couple's. If Hide told me to die right now, I’d do it gladly. I’ve been held by hundreds of men I loathed for the sake of business, but this is the first real love I’ve ever known. Of course, they’d find out eventually. But when we’re sitting in a cafe, or at a dance hall, or staying in a hotel... for those moments, we want to go back to being the girls we were before we fell—clean in body and soul. How could we confess to being whores while we're drunk on that kind of happiness? Even we have dreams, Mr. Emoto. Don't you see?"

**IV. The Hanshin Pickpockets: The End of a Family**

In the early hours of February 13th, a squad of plainclothes officers under Detective Emoto’s command descended upon the Abeno-bashi district in a lightning-fast raid.

Naturally, Kiyoko Yoimura and Chizu Kawada were hauled out of the Daishinrou in Imazato, looking disheveled in their nightclothes.

The net swept up a diverse school of "small fry"—streetwalkers, male prostitutes, gamblers, petty thieves, and junk dealers. However, the "big fish"—the Three Crows of the South—managed to slip away once again.

"Fine! I’ll fight them to the bitter end," Emoto declared. "As long as there's breath in my body, I’ll scour every nest of vice in Abeno and crush them!"

Ablaze with the fire of justice, the detective set out to clean up the underworld of knives and guns.

By February 17th, the headlines screamed across the social pages of the *Osaka Mainichi*, the *Osaka Shimbun*, and the *Jiji Shimpo*: "The Enchanting Trio: 'Hanshin Pickpocket' Family Crushed! Arrested for Theft and Extortion!" (End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Format:** This is a page from a Japanese "pulp" magazine (likely a *kasutori* magazine or a similar sensationalist publication from the post-war era).
*   **Layout:** Standard vertical Japanese text orientation. It features three main columns. The right side contains the narrative/dialogue, while the bottom-left contains the dramatic conclusion and a small postscript note.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. It uses *furigana* (reading aids) for some kanji, though sparingly.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The section break "四、阪神カスリ" (4. Hanshin Kasuri) and the subtitle "一家の最後" (The End of a Family) are set in a larger, bolder weight to denote a transition in the narrative.
*   **Design Features:** The page number "— 25 —" is centered at the bottom. The text is dense, with little "white space," typical of low-budget magazines of the era trying to fit as much content as possible.
*   **Style:** The prose is "hardboiled" yet sentimental, a style common in *shakai-bu* (social affairs/crime) reporting of the 1950s.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era:** This text likely dates from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s (pre-1958).
*   **Red-Light Districts:** It mentions **Tobita** (飛田) and **Imazato** (今里). These were famous "Red Line" (Akasen) districts in Osaka where prostitution was quasi-legal before the Anti-Prostitution Law was fully enforced in 1958.
*   **Post-War Hardship:** The protagonist justifies her crime by pointing to government corruption ("ministers stealing millions"), reflecting the widespread cynicism and poverty in occupied and post-war Japan.
*   **Vocabulary of the Underworld:** Terms like *settai-fu* (reception girl) were euphemisms for prostitutes. *Kasuri* is a slang term for pickpocketing.
*   **Minami no Sanninchō (Three Crows of the South):** This sounds like a typical pulp fiction trope—a gang of three charismatic male outlaws who serve as the romantic counterparts to the three female pickpockets.
*   **Doburoku Shop:** These were often fronts for illegal activity or gathering spots for the lower classes/criminals to drink cheap, home-brewed alcohol.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **ズラかつた (Zurakatta):** Past tense of *zuraku*, slang for running away or escaping.
*   **お茶を引いた (Ocha o hiita):** A term from the Edo-period pleasure quarters meaning "to have no customers for the night." Literally "to grind tea."
*   **ドブロク (Doburoku):** Unrefined, home-brewed sake, often sold illegally in the post-war period.
*   **カンテキ (Kanteki):** Kansai dialect for a *shichirin* (small charcoal grill).
*   **ヨタモノ (Yota-mono):** A hoodlum, delinquent, or good-for-nothing.
*   **パンパン (Pan-pan):** A post-war term specifically for prostitutes who serviced Allied occupation soldiers, though often used more broadly for streetwalkers.
*   **十把一からげ (Jippa-ikarage):** An idiom meaning "lumping things together" or "treating everyone the same way," often referring to "small fry."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Nihilism vs. Morality:** The female protagonist (Masa) challenges the detective's morality. She argues that her crimes are a response to a corrupt society and that her "pure" love for a criminal is more honest than the hypocrisy of the "great men" in government.
*   **The "Pure" Prostitute:** A classic literary trope (the "prostitute with a heart of gold"). Despite her "muddy" profession, she yearns for a clean, normal life, if only for a few hours in a cafe or dance hall.
*   **Class Conflict:** There is a clear divide between the "sunny side" of society (the detective's daughter fanning the stove) and the "shadow side" (the pickpockets and thugs in Abeno).
*   **Police as Paternal Figures:** Detective Emoto is portrayed as both a hunter of criminals and a fatherly figure who "nods like an uncle," suggesting the complex, sometimes intimate relationship between the police and the underworld in urban neighborhoods.
