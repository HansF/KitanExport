情痴に狂う中年女
　　　　一、疑　惑

他人の噂はあてにならぬと思いいかえしてみたが、一度、確かめてみたい――いや、どうしても確かめなければと、田村信二は、会社の昼休みに家へ帰ってきた。
　忘れ物をしたといえばいい。
　道々思っていたことを、もう一度くりかえし、思いきって表戸に手をかけた。
　おや？――
　内から錠がかかっている。ためしにもう一度押したが、ビクともしない。
　声をかければ裏から逃がすだろう。
　擦硝子のまわった格子戸は一分の隙もない。板塀をぐるりと廻り、裏戸に手をかけると、のれんを押すように、軽く、開く。
　半分畑になっている庭先を、爪先だって進み、戸に手をかけてみると、そこは開かない。
「引きかえそうか？」
　しかし、好奇心と憎悪のかたまりみたいになった信二は、じっと耳を澄まして内部を窺った。
　義理の母でも母だ、その秘密を暴いて何になろう――いや、何も知らずにいまごろ、大学で、めつきり白髪のふえた頭をふって講義をしているだろう父の、やさしい眼、――柔和な微笑――そのためのなのだ。
　信二は、障子の隙間に耳をあて、呼吸をひそめた。
――と、気のせいではない、息使いがする。爛熟した四十女の、激しい慾性の息吹だ――。
　信二は、始めて、恋人光子の肌を知った夜の公園を思い出した。
　大樹の暗い葉蔭、ほのかな月明りで味った、処女の、白く、匂やかな肢体――。
　光子と、早く結婚したい、そのためもある。己れの快楽のために、子に夫に逆く淫婦奴ッくそッ！
　すると、動く気配と、母の、含み笑いが、微かにした。男の、太い声が、何かいつて笑った。絹づれの音もする。
　今だッ。思わず信二は戸を叩いた。
「お母さん――」
　呼ぼうとした声がかすれて――返事もない。中で、驚いて、慌てて、男と何か早口にいっている――と、足音が表へ駈けた。
「しまった。」と思ったが、二度目の戸を叩いていた。
「誰ッ？、どなた？」
　慌てた返事だ。部屋を二、三回往復している義母の姿が見えるようだ。
　おぉッ、表戸が開いて、閉まった。
　小走りに去行男の姿が見える。

「お母さん」
　まるで、悪いことをしたような、駆け出したような、胸が波立って、信二は
「ぼ、ぼくです」
　慌てて、たたきを歩く下駄の音がして
「信二かえ？――いまあけるから――頭が痛いて、ちょっと――」
　錠を外す音がして
「変な押売りでもくるといけないから――と思って――」
　ガラ～と障子が開き、義母、満枝の、大きな眼が、キッ信二をみつめた。
「どうしたんだえ？――いまごろ」
　母の眼をさけて、低く、
「ぼく、忘れものを――したんです」
「なにを？」
「書、書類です――」
　義母は返事をしない、じろ～とみている。
　信二は、さけるようにして義母の傍を通るとき、いまの痴態を連想させるむうっとした女の体臭を生温く感じて逃げるように奥へ――。
　二階へ上って、本箱の傍に、しばらく立ちつくして、動悸を鎮めようと、あせりながら、書類を探しているらしく装い、ひきだしを開け閉めしてからやがて、階下へ――度胸をすえて、しづかに、降りた。
　たしかに、髪が乱れて、頸筋が汗ばんでいた――。
　義母は、片膝を立てて、長火鉢に肘をつき、掌に額をのせていたが、降りてきた信二をチラッとみたたり、何かいわない。

情痴に狂う中年女
一、疑惑

他人の噂はあてにならぬと思い返してみたが、一度、確かめてみたい――いや、どうしても確かめなければと、田村信二は、会社の昼休みに家へ帰ってきた。
「忘れ物をした」と言えばいい。
道々思っていたことを、もう一度繰り返し、思い切って表戸に手をかけた。
おや？――
内から錠がかかっている。試しにもう一度押したが、ビクともしない。
声をかければ裏から逃がすだろう。
擦りガラスの回った格子戸は一分の隙もない。板塀をぐるりと回り、裏戸に手をかけると、暖簾を押すように、軽く、開く。
半分畑になっている庭先を、爪先立って進み、戸に手をかけてみると、そこは開かない。
「引き返そうか？」
しかし、好奇心と憎悪の塊みたいになった信二は、じっと耳を澄まして内部を窺った。
義理の母でも母だ、その秘密を暴いて何になろう――いや、何も知らずに今頃、大学で、めっきり白髪の増えた頭を振って講義をしているだろう父の、優しい眼、――柔和な微笑――そのためのなのだ。
信二は、障子の隙間に耳をあて、呼吸を潜めた。
――と、気のせいではない、息遣いがする。爛熟した四十女の、激しい欲性の息吹だ――。
信二は、初めて、恋人・光子の肌を知った夜の公園を思い出した。
大樹の暗い葉陰、ほのかな月明かりで味わった、処女の、白く、匂やかな肢体――。
光子と、早く結婚したい、そのためもある。己の快楽のために、子に夫に背く淫婦奴、くそっ！
すると、動く気配と、母の含み笑いが、微かにした。男の太い声が、何か言って笑った。衣擦れの音もする。
今だ。思わず信二は戸を叩いた。
「お母さん――」
呼ぼうとした声がかすれて――返事もない。中で驚いて、慌てて、男と何か早口に言っている――と、足音が表へ駆けた。
「しまった」と思ったが、二度目の戸を叩いていた。
「誰？、どなた？」
慌てた返事だ。部屋を二、三回往復している義母の姿が見えるようだ。
おおっ、表戸が開いて、閉まった。
小走りに去り行く男の姿が見える。

「お母さん」

「ぼ、僕です」
慌てて、叩きを歩く下駄の音がして、
「信二かい？――今開けるから――頭が痛くて、ちょっと――」
錠を外す音がして、
「変な押し売りでも来るといけないから――と思って――」
ガラリと障子が開き、義母・満枝の、大きな眼が、キッと信二を見つめた。
「どうしたんだい？――今頃」
母の眼を避けて、低く、
「僕、忘れ物を――したんです」
「何を？」
「書、書類です――」
義母は返事をしない、じろりと見ている。
信二は、避けるようにして義母の傍を通る時、今の痴態を連想させるムッとした女の体臭を生温く感じて、逃げるように奥へ――。
二階へ上がって、本箱の傍に、しばらく立ち尽くして、動悸を鎮めようと焦りながら、書類を探しているらしく装い、引き出しを開け閉めしてから、やがて階下へ――度胸を据えて、静かに降りた。
確かに、髪が乱れて、襟足が汗ばんでいた――。
義母は、片膝を立てて、長火鉢に肘をつき、掌に額を乗せていたが、降りてきた信二をチラッと見たり、何も言わない。
少しはだけた、薄桃色の長襦袢の裾が乱れ、白い脚が覗いて――信二は、いつもならそんなことはないのだが、今日はそれが艶めかしく感じ、ぐったりしている母の姿に、

**A Middle-aged Woman Driven Mad by Sexual Infatuation**
**1. Suspicion**

Other people's rumors, [he] thought they were unreliable and tried to reconsider, but once, [he] wanted to confirm—no, [he] must confirm by all means—and so Tamura Shinji, during his company's lunch break, returned home.
Saying he forgot something would be fine.
The things he had been thinking along the way, [he] repeated once more, and resolutely placed his hand on the front door.
Oh? —
From the inside, it is locked. As a test, he pushed once more, but it did not budge.
If he called out, [she] would likely let [the man] escape from the back.
The lattice door with frosted glass has not even a tiny gap. Going around the board fence, when he put his hand to the back door, like pushing a curtain, lightly, it opens.
The yard, which has half become a field, he proceeded on tiptoe, and when he tried putting his hand on the [inner] door, there, it does not open.
"Should I turn back?"
However, Shinji, who had become like a mass of curiosity and hatred, listened intently and peered inside.
Even if she is a stepmother, she is a mother; exposing that secret, what would come of it? —No, at this time, knowing nothing, at the university, shaking his head with hair that has noticeably turned white while giving a lecture, probably, is his father's gentle eyes—and gentle smile—it is for that sake.
Shinji applied his ear to the gap in the shoji and suppressed his breath.
—And, it is not his imagination, there is the sound of breathing. It is the intense, lustful breathing of a fully ripened woman of forty—.
Shinji, for the first time, remembered the park at night where he learned the skin of his lover, Mitsuko.
The dark leaf-shade of a large tree, tasted in the faint moonlight, the virgin's white, fragrant limbs—.
He wants to marry Mitsuko soon; there is that reason too. For the sake of her own pleasure, a hussy who betrays child and husband, damn it!
Then, there was a sign of movement and his mother's muffled laugh, faintly. A man's thick voice said something and laughed. There is also the sound of silk rubbing.
Now! Without thinking, Shinji knocked on the door.
"Mother—"
The voice that tried to call out was hoarse—there is no reply. Inside, surprised, in a hurry, [she] is saying something to the man in a fast voice—and then, footsteps ran to the front.
"Damn it," he thought, but he was knocking on the door a second time.
"Who? Who is it?"
It is a flurried reply. The figure of the stepmother walking back and forth in the room two or three times can almost be seen.
Oh, the front door opened and closed.
The figure of a man leaving at a trot can be seen.

"Mother."
As if he himself had done something bad, as if he had run out, his chest heaving, Shinji:
"I-it's me."
Hurriedly, the sound of wooden clogs walking on the concrete floor made:
"Is that Shinji? —I'll open it now—my head hurts, just a bit—"
The sound of removing the lock made:
"I thought it might be a strange peddler coming—so—"
With a clatter, the shoji opened, and the stepmother Mitsue's large eyes stared sharply at Shinji.
"What's the matter? —At this hour."
Avoiding the mother's eyes, lowly:
"I, something I forgot—did [it]."
"What?"
"Do... documents—"
The stepmother does not reply; she is staring "jiro~" (intently).
Shinji, as if to avoid her, when passing by the stepmother's side, felt the lukewarm body odor of the woman that gave off a stuffy feeling reminiscent of the recent lewdness, and as if escaping, went to the back—.
Going up to the second floor, by the bookcase, he stood still for a while, and while rushing to calm his palpitations, pretending as if searching for documents, after opening and closing drawers, eventually to the ground floor—setting his courage, quietly, he descended.
Certainly, her hair was disheveled, and her neckline was sweaty—.
The stepmother, with one knee up, leaning her elbow on the long brazier, had her forehead on her palm, but she only glanced at the descending Shinji and said nothing.
The hem of the slightly disheveled pale pink long under-kimono was messy, and a white leg peeked out—Shinji, usually that would not be so, but today, he felt that was voluptuous, and at the figure of the mother who was limp...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Middle-aged Woman Drowned in Lust**
**Chapter 1: Suspicion**

Shinji Tamura tried to dismiss the rumors as idle gossip, but the urge to know the truth gnawed at him. He had to be sure. Driven by a desperate need for certainty, he slipped away from work during his lunch break and returned home. If anyone asked, he would simply say he’d forgotten something.

Steeling his nerves, he repeated his excuse once more before reaching for the front door. To his surprise, it was locked from the inside. He pushed again, but it wouldn't budge. *If I call out now,* he thought, *she'll just let him out the back.* 

The frosted-glass lattice door offered no glimpse inside. He circled the wooden fence to the rear entrance. To his relief, the back door gave way easily, like pushing aside a light curtain. He crept through the yard—now half-overgrown like a field—on tiptoe. But the inner door was barred.

"Should I just go back?" he whispered to himself. But Shinji was no longer just a son; he was a knotted mass of morbid curiosity and growing hatred. He pressed his ear against the wood, straining to hear.

*She is my stepmother, yes, but she is still a 'mother.' What good will it do to expose her secret?* Then he thought of his father—the man currently at the university, his hair thinning and graying, lecturing with those kind eyes and that gentle smile, blissfully unaware. *It’s for him,* Shinji told himself. *I’m doing this for him.*

He pressed his ear to a crack in the sliding door and held his breath. It wasn't his imagination. He heard it: the heavy, ragged breathing of a woman in the throes of passion—the lustful gasps of a woman in her prime.

Suddenly, Shinji was transported back to a night in the park when he first felt the skin of his lover, Mitsuko. He remembered the dark shadows of the trees and the virgin’s white, fragrant body bathed in pale moonlight. He wanted to marry Mitsuko soon. That was another reason he was here. *To betray her child and husband just for her own sick pleasure... damn that hussy!*

A soft movement came from within, followed by his stepmother’s muffled giggle. A man’s deep voice rumbled a response and laughed. Then came the unmistakable rustle of silk against silk.

"Now!" Shinji's hand struck the door. "Mother!"

His voice cracked, coming out hoarse. Silence followed. Then, the frantic sound of whispering inside—hurried, panicked exchanges. Heavy footsteps bolted toward the front of the house. *Damn it!* he thought, even as he pounded on the door a second time.

"Who? Who is it?" Her voice was breathless, panicked. He could almost see her pacing the room in a frenzy. 

Suddenly, the front door clicked open and shut. Through the gap, he saw the fleeting shadow of a man trotting away into the distance.

"Mother," Shinji called out again. His heart hammered against his ribs as if he were the one who had committed a crime. "It... it's me."

The sound of wooden clogs clattered on the entryway floor. "Shinji? Is that you? I'll open it in a second... I have a bit of a headache..." The lock clicked. "I thought it might be a persistent peddler, so I..."

The door slid open with a sharp *clack*. His stepmother, Mitsue, stood there, her large eyes fixed on him with a sharp, piercing intensity. "What are you doing home at this hour?"

Avoiding her gaze, he muttered, "I... I forgot some papers."

"What papers?"

"Just... documents."

She didn't answer. She just stood there, staring at him. As Shinji brushed past her, he caught the stifling, lukewarm scent of her body—a musky odor that brought back the lewd scene he had just overheard. He fled toward the back of the house.

He ran upstairs and stood by the bookcase for a long time, trying to steady his racing pulse. He made a show of rummaging through drawers, opening and closing them with unnecessary noise to sell the lie. Finally, he gathered his courage and descended the stairs.

Up close, there was no mistaking it. Her hair was a mess, and her neck was damp with sweat. Mitsue sat by the long brazier, one knee drawn up, leaning her head on her hand. She gave him a fleeting glance but remained silent. 

The hem of her pale pink under-kimono had fallen open, revealing the stark white of her leg. Normally, Shinji wouldn't have noticed, but today, the sight of her—languid and disheveled—felt dangerously provocative.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography**: This is a classic example of Japanese pulp magazine layout from the mid-20th century. The text is arranged in vertical columns, reading right to left.
*   **Visual Hierarchy**:
    *   **The Sensation Title**: "情痴に狂う中年女" (The middle-aged woman mad with lust) acts as a sensational hook at the top right, likely the theme of the issue or a recurring segment.
    *   **Main Title**: "夫は生きていた" (The Husband Was Alive) is set in a much larger, stylized hand-drawn font in the center-bottom. This is likely the title of the serialized story.
    *   **Chapter Header**: "一、疑惑" (1. Suspicion) is boxed, clearly demarcating the start of the narrative.
    *   **Illustrations**: There are two small illustrations. On the bottom left, a man's face (likely Shinji), looking distressed. On the bottom right, a woman's legs peeking out from a kimono—a visual "fan service" element typical of *Kasutori* magazines.
*   **Design Elements**: The use of "ruby" (furigana) is minimal, suggesting an adult audience. The page number "(60)" is visible at the bottom. The framing of the text around the large central title creates a dynamic, if somewhat cluttered, visual flow.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era**: Late 1940s to 1950s. This was the era of *Kasutori* (dregs) magazines—cheap, sensationalist publications that flourished in post-war Japan. They focused on "3S" content: Screen, Sport, and Sex (specifically *ero-guro-nansensu*).
*   **Social Morality**: The story touches on the tension between traditional family structures and the perceived "moral decay" of the post-war period. The contrast between the "pure" college professor father and the "lustful" stepmother reflects common tropes of the time.
*   **Domestic Life**: Mentions of the *nagahibachi* (long brazier) and *tataki* (concrete or earth entryway) place the setting in a traditional Japanese house, common before the widespread Westernization of domestic architecture in the 60s.
*   **Gender Tropes**: The "lustful middle-aged woman" (forty years old was considered "middle-aged" and sexually "ripe" in this era's literature) and the "innocent young man" are classic archetypes in Japanese erotic-leaning pulp.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **情痴 (Jōchi)**: A state of being blinded or driven mad by sexual passion or infatuation. It's a heavy, slightly archaic term often used in pulp titles.
*   **爛熟 (Ranjuku)**: Literally "overripe." Used here to describe a woman in her 40s, implying she is at the peak of her sexual maturity.
*   **欲性 (Yokusei)**: Passion or carnal desire.
*   **肢体 (Shitai)**: Limbs or body. In this context, it has a distinctly sexualized nuance.
*   **淫婦 (Impu)**: A hussay, lewd woman, or adultress. The suffix "奴" (me/do) adds a layer of contempt ("that damn hussy").
*   **長襦袢 (Nagajuban)**: A full-length under-kimono. Seeing a woman in just her *juban* with the hem open was a common erotic shorthand in Japanese literature and art.
*   **たたき (Tataki)**: The hard-packed earth or finished concrete floor of a traditional Japanese entryway where shoes are removed.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Oedipal Tension**: While she is his stepmother, Shinji’s disgust is mixed with a budding, unwanted physical awareness of her sensuality. He compares her to his virgin lover, creating a psychological conflict between "pure" love and "corrupt" lust.
*   **Generational Conflict**: The son acts as a moral guardian for his father’s honor. The father is portrayed as a scholarly, perhaps physically declining man, while the stepmother is "overripe" and vital, suggesting a mismatch that leads to her infidelity.
*   **Class & Education**: The father is a university professor, representing the intellectual elite. The stepmother’s "low" behavior (affair with a man who trots away like a commoner) suggests a betrayal of their social standing.
*   **Suspense & Voyeurism**: The narrative relies heavily on sensory details—the sound of breathing, the smell of a body, the glimpse of a leg—engaging the reader's voyeuristic tendencies.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type**: Fiction, Pulp, Serialized Novel.
*   **Genre**: Melodrama, Erotica (soft), Mystery/Suspense.
*   **Themes**: Infidelity, Family Secrets, Step-parental relations, Post-war Japan, Sensationalism.
*   **Classification Flags**: Adult themes, suggestiveness.
