## 3️⃣ Literal English Translation

**Header:** To everyone who loved me (Page 36)
**Title:** To Everyone Who Loved Me
**Subtitle:** Yuko's Words of Farewell
**Author:** Furukawa Yuko

**Handwritten Text:**
The monkey-gag might be / for the sake of / sexual desire / [I] do not know.

**Body Text:**
I am now in the midst of an unspeakable confusion. Since writing my "Confession"—fantasies and expectations of humiliation—in the December issue of *Kitan Club*, not even a few days passed before a mountain-like bundle of letters came rushing to my hand.
No, it is not letters only. Despite the fact that outside of my pen name, no one besides myself—no, myself and my brother-in-law—was supposed to know the real name of Furukawa Yuko, there are even people who came directly to me saying, "Perhaps it is you? No, there is no mistake, it is you."
While marveling at the goodness of those people's "intuition," how could I say on the spot, "As you guessed, I am Furukawa Yuko"? At any rate, I cannot help but deny it once. It is a story that does not match logic. Having called out [to people] on the magazine pages myself...

## 4️⃣ Literary English Translation

**Header:** To Everyone Who Loved Me
**Title:** **To All Those Who Loved Me**
**Subtitle:** Yuko's Farewell Address
**Author:** Furukawa Yuko

**Image Caption:** *Perhaps this gag is worn for the sake of lust... I truly do not know.*

**Body Text:**
I currently find myself in a state of indescribable turmoil. It has been only a few days since I published my "Confession"—my fantasies and expectations regarding humiliation—in the December issue of *Kitan Club*, yet a mountain of letters has already arrived at my doorstep.
But it wasn't just letters. Other than myself—no, other than myself and my brother-in-law—no one was supposed to know the real identity behind the pen name "Furukawa Yuko." And yet, there have been men who approached me in person, insisting, "It's you, isn't it? There is no mistake; you are her."
While I marveled at the terrifying accuracy of their intuition, how could I simply admit on the spot, "Yes, as you guessed, I am Furukawa Yuko"? I felt compelled to deny it at least once. It defies logic, I know. After all, I was the one who called out to you in these very pages...

## 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Genre:** **Pseudo-Confessional / Reader-Participatory Erotica.** This is a classic *Kitan Club* trope where a "female contributor" (real or editorial fabrication) engages in a dialogue with readers to heighten the sense of reality.
*   **Narrative Strategy:** The text employs the **"Exposure Anxiety" trope**. By claiming readers tracked her down in real life, the magazine blurs the line between fantasy and reality, making the erotica feel illicit and dangerous.
*   **Key Character:** The mention of the **"Brother-in-law" (義兄 - Gikei)** is structurally significant. In 1950s Japan, living arrangements often included extended family. The brother-in-law represents a proximate, taboo male authority figure, a staple in Japanese SM literature.
*   **Placement:** The reference to the "December Issue" suggests this is a follow-up feature, likely early in the new year (January or February issue), designed to retain readership continuity.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

*   **Kitan Club (奇譚クラブ):** The most influential underground fetish magazine in post-war Japan. It was instrumental in codifying the aesthetics of Japanese Bondage (Shibari). The "December Issue" reference anchors this text in a specific (though currently unidentified) year, likely mid-1950s based on the font and layout.
*   **Ryōjoku (凌辱 - Humiliation):** A keyword in Showa era erotica. Unlike Western BDSM which often emphasized "discipline," Japanese SM of this era focused heavily on the emotional state of shame and the aesthetic of the suffering victim (often clad in kimono).
*   **The Pen Name Paradox:** The author claims "Furukawa Yuko" is a pen name, yet implies people found her real identity. This is a common logical loop in pulp magazines intended to make the reader feel like a detective or an insider.
*   **Post-War Censorship:** The text is careful. It focuses on "feelings" (confusion, intuition) rather than explicit sexual acts, skirting the *waihisetsu* (obscenity) laws of the time by focusing on psychological masochism.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes

*   **Saru-gutsuwa (猿ぐつわ):** Lit. "Monkey Gag." A specific type of gag often used in Japanese bondage where the mouth is stuffed with cloth or a dedicated bit, distinct from the ball gags common in Western imagery.
*   **Wakuran (惑乱):** Confusion, distraction, derangement. A slightly literary term implying a loss of composure due to intense emotion or desire.
*   **Rikutsu / Rikutsu (理窟 / 理屈):** Logic or reason. The text uses the kanji `理窟` (an older variant often used for "quibbling" or "sophistry") rather than the standard `理屈`, adding a nuanced flavor of "twisted logic."
*   **Kan (感):** Translated here as "intuition," but implies a gut feeling or sixth sense.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Thrill of Discovery:** The central fantasy here is not just the bondage, but the **breach of anonymity**. The idea that the "perverted woman" is hiding in plain sight (perhaps a neighbor or relative) is the core erotic engine.
*   **Performative Reluctance:** The narrator claims she had to deny her identity ("I cannot help but deny it once"), manifesting the cultural script of *tatemae* (public facade) vs. *honne* (true desire). This reluctance enhances the masochistic flavor—she wants to be found, but social rules force her to hide.
*   **The Kimono:** The illustration features a kimono, reinforcing the "traditional Japanese beauty" subjected to modern/perverse curiosity. The contrast between the formal attire and the "monkey gag" is a staple of *Kitan Club* aesthetics.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Classification Tags

*   **Type:** Text & Illustration
*   **Sexual Themes:** Bondage (Shibari), Gagging, Masochism, Humiliation (Ryōjoku).
*   **Taboo:** Incestuous undertones (Brother-in-law mentioned as the only confidant).
*   **Consent:** Ambiguous (Consensual fantasy of non-consent).
*   **Violence:** Restraint implies psychological violence/dominance, but no gore is depicted.
