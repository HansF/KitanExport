　彼は思った。捨てゝ置けない気がした。それは憎んでも余りある汚い行為だと彼は思考力の萎えた頭で、いろいろと考え悩んだが、結局、何か得体の知れぬもやもやしたものが粕のように胸に残った。

　夜は気温がぐっとくだり、毛布一枚ではうすら寒く、幾度も目が覚め、充分な睡眠がとれなかった。
　浅い眠りから覚めた中田伍長の眼に木の間を洩る陽光が眩しかった。水筒の水で口をすすぐと、飯盒を引寄せ、冷えきった粥をすすり始めた。温める事は出来ないのである。暮間火を焚くと煙が目標になり、砲弾の雨を浴びなければならない。火はすべて夜間、入口を密蔽した横穴の中で、ひそかに焚かれていた。燈間火を焚く事は厳重なタブーとなつていて、それを犯す事は絶体許されなかった。粥には南方毒菊（俗称）の葉が米より多く入って居て、それに極く少量の塩が入れてあつた。しかし今は、その貴重な塩も残り少ない。
「二三日米を搗くのが彼等の日課になつていた。彼は籾の束を携帯天幕に包んで立上り
「米搗きに行って来るからな」
とマラリアの衰弱で震た切りの佐野一等兵に壁を残して小屋を出た。初め十五人居た第二分隊も今は中田伍長と佐野一等兵の二人切りになって仕舞つていた。
　約二百米後方に、なかば倒壊した土人の家屋が七戸あり、その家の中に木製の臼が数個あつて、兵隊達はそこを米搗き場と云つていた。
　杵は何と云う木なのか馬鹿に重く。一升搗くと額に汗がにじみ出た。単調な動作を繰返していると、次から次へとんいろな想いが浮び、そして消えた結局昨夜のもやもやとした不燃焼物のようなものが、再び彼の頭の中に一杯ひろがり、彼をいらいらさせた。
（よし！行ってやろう！そしてこの嫌な胸につかえているものを叩きつけ、さっぱりしよう！）
　彼は谷へ降りて、女が居るという横穴の前に立った。女は三尺程の入口を背にして髪を解いていた。
「今日は！」
　彼は冷静にと勉めて言葉をかけた心算だつたが、内心の怒りを抑え切れず声がふるえた。女は振り返ると、
（今頃何の御用？）
と云つた表情で首をかしげ彼の眼をのぞき込んだ。
　彼が思わず感嘆の吐息を洩らして仕舞つた程の美貌だつた。
（華麗なダリアだ！）
瞬間彼はそう思うた。その美しさに二十四才の彼の若さは忽ち圧倒されてしまった。
（此れは人違いかも知れない、だが現地人達はもっと後方にいる筈だが…）
　彼は、いさゝか周章て気味で、用意して来た数々の言葉が仲々思い出せなかつた。
「……君が……米で……」
　充分意味のとれぬ言葉に、女は一寸首をかしげて居たが、すぐ、朝の若い訪問者の来意を覚つたと云つた表情で「え、そうですね！どうぞお入りになつて」
　ガーン！！横穴の位置から十米位の地点に砲弾が落下して、二人は土煙に包まれた。
「危いわ！早く……」
　彼が中に入ると、そこは一坪半位の広さで、細い丸太を並べた床の上に毛布が敷いてあり、その上に雪のように白いバス・タオルがかけてあつた。女は空罐製のラムプに燈を点じ、入口の戸を締め、つゝかいをした。ラムプの燈が妖しい迄に美しく彼女を照らし出していた。
　二十二三だと彼は思った。深緑色の薄いワンピースに包まれた、なだらかな肉体の曲線、胸元からのぞいているむっちりした白い肉、彼の若い官能は烈しい炎となって燃え上り、今にもぐらぐらと自制心が崩れてゆきそうで心細かつた。彼は身を固くし乍ら持つて来た米袋を床の上に置き、危やふやな心にぴしりと鞭打ち、思い切つて口をきつた。
「自分は！自分は神聖な戦場を汚してもらいたくないんだ！」

　夜は気温がぐっと下がり、毛布一枚ではうすら寒く、幾度も目が覚め、十分な睡眠がとれなかった。
　浅い眠りから覚めた中田伍長の眼に、木の間を漏れる陽光が眩しかった。水筒の水で口をすすぐと、飯盒を引き寄せ、冷え切った粥をすすり始めた。温めることはできないのである。昼間、火を焚くと煙が目標になり、砲弾の雨を浴びなければならない。火はすべて夜間、入口を密閉した横穴の中で、ひそかに焚かれていた。昼間に火を焚くことは厳重なタブーとなっていて、それを犯すことは絶対に許されなかった。粥には南方毒菊（俗称）の葉が米より多く入っていて、それに極く少量の塩が入れてあった。しかし今は、その貴重な塩も残り少ない。

　彼は谷へ降りて、女がいるという横穴の前に立った。女は三尺（約90cm）ほどの入口を背にして髪を解いていた。
「今日は（こんにちは）！」
　彼は冷静に、と努めて言葉をかけた格好だったが、内心の怒りを抑えきれず声が震えた。女は振り返ると、

　二十二、三歳だと彼は思った。深緑色の薄いワンピースに包まれた、なだらかな肉体の曲線、胸元から覗いているむっちりした白い肉。彼の若い官能は烈しい炎となって燃え上がり、今にもぐらぐらと自制心が崩れてゆきそうで心細かった。彼は身を固くしながら持ってきた米袋を床に置き、あやふやな心にぴしりと鞭打ち、思い切って口をきいた。

He thought. Leaving it alone feeling not doing he felt. That [was] even if hating more than enough dirty act, he with thinking power withered head, various ways thought and suffered, but in the end, something identity unknown murky thing like dregs in chest remained.

    II

Night temperature sharply fell, with one blanket was chilly, many times eyes opened, sufficient sleep could not be taken.
From shallow sleep awakened Corporal Nakada’s eyes in, through trees leaking sunlight was dazzling. With canteen water mouth rinsed, mess tin pulled close, cold congee slurping started. Warming up thing cannot do. During day fire burn then smoke target becomes, shells rain must bathe in. Fire all during night, entrance sealed dugout inside, secretly was burned. During day fire burning thing strict taboo becoming was, that violating thing absolutely was not permitted. In congee South-side poisonous chrysanthemum (common name) leaves more than rice were in, and in that extremely small amount of salt was put. But now, that precious salt also remaining few.
These two-three days rice pounding their daily task had become. He paddy bundles in portable tent wrapping stood up,
"Rice pounding going coming because"
to malaria weakness from shaking only Private First Class Sano wall [space] leaving hut exited. First fifteen people were Second Squad also now Corporal Nakada and Private First Class Sano two people only had become.
About 200 meters rear, half-collapsed natives' houses seven existed, that house inside wooden mortars several existed, soldiers there rice-pounding place were calling.
Pestle what kind of wood is it foolishly heavy. One sho pound then forehead sweat seeped out. Monotonous movement repeating, one after another various thoughts floated, and disappeared. In the end last night's murky unburned-matter-like thing, again his head inside full spread, him irritated made.
(Right! Go let's! And this unpleasant chest in stuck thing strike down, refreshed let's be!)
He to valley descended, woman exists called dugout front stood. Woman about 3-shaku entrance back to hair unbinding was.
"Today (Hello)!"
He calmly to striving words spoke intention was, but inner anger suppressing could not voice trembled. Woman turned around then,
(This time what business?)

He unintentionally admiration sigh leaked finished extent's beauty was.
(Splendid Dahlia it is!)
Moment he so thought. That beauty by twenty-four years old his youth immediately overwhelmed was finished.
(This person mistake might be, but locals more rear should be but...)
He, somewhat flustered feeling, prepared came numerous words quite could not remember.
"...You... with rice..."
Sufficient meaning not taken words to, woman a bit head tilting was, but immediately, morning's young visitor's intent realized said expression with "Yes, that is so! Please enter become"
BAM!! Dugout position from 10 meters point to shell fell, two people soil smoke in were wrapped.
"Dangerous! Quick..."
He inside entered then, there one-tsubo-half extent's space, thin logs lined floor on top blanket spread was, that on top snow like white bath towel hung was. Woman empty-can made lamp to light lit, entrance door closed, propped. Lamp's light bewitching extent to beautifully her was illuminating.
Twenty-two or three he thought. Dark green thin one-piece dress in wrapped, gentle body curves, from neckline peeping plump white flesh, his young sensuality intense flame becoming burned up, even now wobbling self-control crumbling going seems lonely was. He body stiffening while brought rice bag floor on placed, uncertain heart to sharply whipping, courageously mouth opened.
"I! I sacred battlefield defile not want to have!"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

He thought to himself. He felt he couldn't just let it go. With a mind withered of its power to think, he agonized over it, viewing the situation as a filthy act beyond even the reach of hatred. In the end, a murky, unidentifiable residue remained in his chest like dregs.

    II

The temperature plummeted at night. With only a single blanket, the chill was persistent; he woke frequently and could not get sufficient sleep. When Corporal Nakada finally roused from his shallow slumber, the sunlight filtering through the trees was dazzling. After rinsing his mouth with water from his canteen, he pulled his mess tin toward him and began to slurp cold congee. It was impossible to warm it up. Lighting a fire during the day would create smoke that served as a target, inviting a rain of artillery shells. Fires were only ever lit secretly at night inside dugouts with sealed entrances. Lighting a fire during the day was a strict taboo, and violating it was absolutely forbidden. The congee contained more leaves of the so-called "Southern Poison Chrysanthemum" than actual rice, seasoned with a tiny amount of salt. But now, even that precious salt was running low.

For the past few days, pounding rice had become their daily chore. Nakada wrapped a bundle of unhulled rice in his portable tent cloth and stood up. 
"I'm heading out to pound the rice," he said to Private First Class Sano, who lay shivering incessantly from the effects of malaria, and stepped out of the hut. The Second Squad, which had originally consisted of fifteen men, was now reduced to just Corporal Nakada and Private Sano.

About two hundred meters to the rear stood seven half-collapsed native huts. Inside were several wooden mortars, and the soldiers referred to the place as the "rice-pounding station."
The pestle was made of some unknown wood that was absurdly heavy. After pounding just one *sho* of rice, sweat began to bead on his forehead. As he repeated the monotonous motions, various thoughts drifted in and out of his mind. Ultimately, that murky, "unburned" feeling from the previous night filled his head again, irritating him.
(*Fine! I'll go! I'll strike down this unpleasant thing stuck in my chest and be done with it!*)

He descended into the valley and stood before the dugout where the woman was said to be. She stood with her back to the three-foot-wide entrance, unbinding her hair.
"Hello!"
He intended to speak calmly, but his voice trembled, unable to suppress his inner rage. The woman turned around and looked into his eyes with a tilted head, as if to say, *What business do you have at this hour?*

Her beauty was such that he unintentionally let out a sigh of admiration.
(*She’s a magnificent dahlia!*)
The thought struck him instantly. At twenty-four, his youth was immediately overwhelmed by her beauty.
(*I might have the wrong person... the locals are supposed to be further to the rear...*)
Somewhat flustered, he found himself unable to remember the various words he had prepared.
"...You... about the rice..."
The woman tilted her head at his incoherent words, but she soon seemed to grasp the young morning visitor’s intent. With a knowing look, she said, "Oh, I see! Please, come in."

*CRASH!!* An artillery shell landed about ten meters from the dugout, enveloping them both in a cloud of dust.
"It’s dangerous! Hurry..."
When he stepped inside, he found a space of about one and a half *tsubo*. Blankets were spread over a floor of thin logs, and atop them lay a bath towel as white as snow. The woman lit a lamp made from an old tin can, closed the door, and barred it. The light of the lamp illuminated her with a beauty that was almost haunting.

She looked to be twenty-two or three, he thought. Wrapped in a thin, dark-green one-piece dress, the gentle curves of her body and the plump white flesh peeping from her neckline set his young sensuality ablaze. He felt vulnerable, as if his self-control were about to crumble. Bracing himself, he set the bag of rice on the floor, whipped his wavering heart into submission, and finally forced the words out:
"I—I won't have you defiling this sacred battlefield!"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text follows the traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left, top to bottom.
*   **Structure:** This page (53) begins mid-narrative and introduces a new section marked by the numeral "二" (II). It features a mix of descriptive prose, internal monologue (often in parentheses), and spoken dialogue (in Japanese quotation marks 「 」).
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century Japanese publishing. It utilizes iteration marks like ヽ and ゝ (for repeating kana) and 々 (for repeating kanji), which were more common in the mid-20th century than they are in digital text today.
*   **Visual Elements:** There is a circular illustration at the top left showing two figures—likely the soldier Nakada and the woman mentioned in the text—set against a sketched natural background. The style is reminiscent of charcoal or woodblock prints common in "Bungei" (literary) magazines of the 1940s-50s.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "—53—" is centered at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era and Setting:** The text is set during World War II (likely the early 1940s) in the "Southern Front" (South East Asia or the Pacific Islands), as evidenced by terms like "南方" (Nanpō - the South), malaria, and "土人" (dojin - a then-common, now derogatory term for indigenous/local people).
*   **Rations and Survival:** The mention of mixing "poisonous chrysanthemum" leaves into rice and the desperate shortage of salt reflects the severe supply line failures the Japanese Imperial Army faced toward the end of the war.
*   **"Sacred Battlefield" (Shinsei na Senjō):** This phrase reflects the state-sponsored ideology of the time, which glorified the war as a holy mission. The protagonist's conflict between his physical attraction to the woman and his desire to keep the battlefield "pure" or "sacred" illustrates the psychological strain on young soldiers indoctrinated with imperial ideology.
*   **Comfort Women/Local Interaction:** The presence of a beautiful woman in a dugout trading or interacting with soldiers for rice strongly suggests the "comfort women" system or local women forced into survival-based prostitution, a dark reality of the front lines.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **飯盒 (Hangō):** A standard-issue Japanese military mess tin used for cooking rice and eating.
*   **伍長 (Gochō) / 一等兵 (Ittōhei):** Corporal and Private First Class, respectively.
*   **米を搗く (Kome o tsuku):** To pound rice to remove the husk. A labor-intensive task.
*   **一升 (Isshō):** A traditional unit of volume, approximately 1.8 liters.
*   **三尺 (San-jaku):** A traditional unit of length, approximately 90 cm.
*   **一坪半 (Ittsubo-han):** A measurement of area. One *tsubo* is about 3.3 square meters (the size of two tatami mats). 1.5 *tsubo* is a very cramped space (approx. 5 square meters).
*   **周章てる (Awateru/Futameku):** To be flustered or panicked. Written here with old kanji usage.
*   **官能 (Kannou):** Sensuality or carnal desire.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eros vs. Thanatos:** The proximity of a beautiful, sensual woman ("Dahlia") to the constant threat of death (the falling artillery shell) is a classic literary trope, especially in Japanese "Nikutai bungaku" (flesh literature) or post-war war novels.
*   **Idealism vs. Reality:** The protagonist's outburst about the "sacred battlefield" is a defensive mechanism. He is physically aroused and tempted, but his training and the "filthy act" he previously witnessed (likely sexual in nature) make him lash out to protect his sense of moral purpose.
*   **Dehumanization and Admiration:** The use of "土人" (native) contrasts with his description of the woman as a "splendid dahlia." He is confused by her presence, finding her too beautiful to be a "local" as he understands them, showing a colonialist/racialized gaze.
