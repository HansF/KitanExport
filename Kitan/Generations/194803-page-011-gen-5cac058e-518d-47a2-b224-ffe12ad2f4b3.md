邪戀に狂う
エロ婆殺し
宇津　大兒
紫莊兒・え

「た、大変です、下宿のお婆さんが殺されていますッ」
　昭和二十二年の初冬、八王子の警察署へ、顔と言わず手と言わず掠傷だらけの若い男がとび込んできた。
　その朝、正雄（十九）がフト何かの音を聞いた様な気がして目をさましかけた時、隣室のおきぬ婆さん（六十三）の部屋から唯ならぬ氣配と重苦しい緊張とが流れてきた。
　不審に思った正雄が、そつと布團を抜け出して様子をうかがうと、ワッと悲鳴をあげて驚いた。布團の中で無慘に腦天を叩き割られ、傷口から灰白色の腦漿を流して、朱に染まつてひっくりかえつているのは、正しくおきぬ婆さんである。
　傍の疊の上には、血塗れの薪割斧がほうり出してある。その部屋の片隅のタンスの前には、一人の逞しい男がしきりに抽斗を開けて、目ぼしい衣類を物色している。
　突如に正雄の頭に浮かんだのは、「強盗殺人」と言う兇悪な文字であった。「泥棒ッ、人殺しッ」
　と思わず正雄は夢中で叫んでしまった。正雄の聲にギョッとなりかえつた賊は、形相も恐ろしく、血まみれの斧をとり上げて、矢庭に襖を左右に蹴開くと、逃げる間もあらせず襲いかかつた。どういう気持で正雄は賊と格闘したかわからない。やっとのことで賊の手をふりきって、戸外へ走り出た時は、激動と恐怖で膝がガク〜ともすれば地面に着きそうであつたと言うのである。
　ソレッと言うので、係官は現場へ急行した。
「ウム――」
　思わず彼等係官も息をのんだ程、犯行は慘忍を極めていた。顔が半分に割れる程の鋭い一撃が、致命傷で他には傷は無かつたが、そこから流れ出た血が、枕の下にベットリと溜って、玉虫の背の様に不氣味に光っていた。
　布團の縁を掴んだ斷末魔の苦悶の指先が喰い入るように爪を立てていた。
　半ばうつむけに顔を枕に押しあてた、その唇の間から、僅かにのぞいた白い歯に、歯垢が黄色く浮いて見え、その上に乱れた髪の毛が、たれかかつているのが、生々しく気味が悪かつた。
　係官の眼は職業的に輝やいて、部屋の中を舐める様に一巡した。タンスの抽斗、散らばつている衣類、血の斧、硝子（ガラス）の破れた柱時計、犯行の時間を示すように針は二時十分で止まつている。
　硝子の破片が、あたかも幽鬼のあざ笑うかのように、凄慘な部屋の中にかすかに光りを放つている。永年の經驗を持つ刑事が一應の調査を終えると、
「とにかく、署で詳しく犯人の人相や殺しの様子を聞きたいから」
　と一先づ正雄を参考人として署へ送ると、捜査陣は型通り檢死の段どりとなつた。

**Driven Mad by Wicked Love**
**The Ero-Old Woman Murder**
By Utsu Daiji
Illustration by Shisōji

"I- it is a disaster! The old lady of the boarding house is being killed!"
In the early winter of Showa 22 [1947], into the Hachioji police station, not saying face and not saying hands [all over face and hands], a young man covered in scratches came jumping in.
That morning, when Masao (19) felt like he suddenly heard some kind of sound and was about to wake up, from the room of the neighbor Okinu-baasan (63), an unusual presence and heavy tension flowed out.
Masao, thinking it suspicious, softly slipped out of the futon and peeked at the situation, then gave a "Wa!" scream and was surprised. Inside the futon, miserably having her crown of the head smashed open, from the wound flowing gray-white brain-slush, dyed in vermilion and overturned, it was truly Okinu-baasan.
On the tatami nearby, a blood-smeared wood-splitting axe was thrown out. In the corner of that room, in front of the chest of drawers, one sturdy man was incessantly opening drawers and scouting for prominent clothing.
Suddenly, what floated into Masao's head were the atrocious characters saying "Robbery-Murder." "Thief! Murderer!"
Without thinking, Masao shouted in a daze. The thief, who was startled by Masao's voice, had a terrifying countenance; picking up the blood-smeared axe, he suddenly kicked open the sliding doors to left and right, and without giving time to flee, he attacked. With what feeling Masao fought the thief, he does not know. When he finally shook off the thief's hand and ran outside, from agitation and fear his knees were shaking-shaking, almost touching the ground, it is said.
With a "There!" the officials rushed to the scene.
"Umu..."
The officials also unintentionally caught their breath; the crime reached the extremes of cruelty. A sharp single blow enough to split the face in half was the fatal wound, and there were no other wounds, but the blood that flowed out from there gathered stickily under the pillow, eerily shining like the back of a jewel beetle.
The fingertips of the death-agony suffering, which gripped the edge of the futon, were setting nails as if biting in.
With the face pressed against the pillow half-downward, from between those lips, the white teeth slightly peeking out showed yellow tartar floating, and over them the disheveled hair was hanging; it was vividly creepy.
The eyes of the officials shone professionally and made a round as if licking the inside of the room. Drawers of the chest, scattered clothing, the bloody axe, the wall clock with broken glass—showing the time of the crime, the hands were stopped at 2:10.
The fragments of glass, as if a ghost were sneering, were emitting a faint light inside the gruesome room. When the detective with many years of experience finished the preliminary investigation:
"Anyway, because I want to hear the details of the criminal's features and the state of the killing at the station,"
Saying so, he first sent Masao to the station as a witness, and the investigation team began the routine procedures for the autopsy.

The wide-angle lens photographed the six-mat scene in eight frames, and then began the photography of the victim. Without breaking that posture, one frame and again one frame, carefully even amidst the tension.

**Maddened by Lust: The "Ero-Granny" Murder**
By Daiji Utsu
Art by Shisōji

"Help! Someone help! The lady at the boarding house... she’s been murdered!"
It was early winter in 1947 when a young man burst into the Hachioji police station, his face and hands covered in frantic scratches. 
That morning, nineteen-year-old Masao had been drifting awake, thinking he’d heard a strange noise, when an oppressive, heavy tension began to seep from the room of his neighbor, sixty-three-year-old Okinu.
Sensing something was wrong, Masao crept out of his futon to investigate. He let out a strangled cry of horror. There, sprawled in her bedding, was Okinu. Her skull had been brutally split open, gray-white brain matter oozing from the wound, her entire body soaked in a brilliant, ghastly crimson.
A blood-stained wood-splitting axe lay discarded on the tatami nearby. In the corner, a hulking man was ransacking a chest of drawers, hunting for anything of value.
The words *Robbery-Murder* flashed through Masao’s mind in jagged, ugly characters. "Thief! Murderer!" he screamed, lost in a trance of terror. 
Startled, the intruder turned—his face a mask of primal fury. He snatched up the bloody axe, kicked the sliding doors aside with a crash, and lunged at Masao before he could even turn to run. Masao didn’t know how he managed to fight the man off; he only knew that by the time he broke free and staggered out into the street, his knees were knocking so violently with fear and adrenaline that he nearly collapsed.
"Move out!" the lead officer barked, and the team raced to the scene.
"Good god..."
Even the seasoned officers recoiled. The cruelty of the act was absolute. A single, savage blow had nearly split the woman’s face in two. There were no other marks, but the blood had pooled beneath her pillow in a thick, viscous slick that shimmered with an eerie, iridescent sheen, like the back of a jewel beetle.
Her fingers, locked in the final agony of death, were clawing into the edge of her quilt. Her face was pressed into the pillow, her lips parted just enough to reveal yellowed teeth. Strands of matted hair clung to her skin—a sight so raw and wretched it turned the stomach.
The officers’ eyes scanned the room with practiced, clinical precision: the hanging drawers, the clothes strewn everywhere, the gore-slicked axe, and the wall clock with its shattered glass, the hands frozen at 2:10—the silent witness to the moment of the crime.
Splinters of glass glinted in the gloom like the mocking laughter of a ghost. After a preliminary sweep, the veteran detective turned to Masao.
"We’re taking you to the station. We need a full description of the suspect and every detail of what you saw."
As Masao was led away for questioning, the forensics team began the grim, routine work of the autopsy.

(Illustration Caption)
With a wide-angle lens, they took eight shots of the six-mat room before turning the camera to the victim. Frame by frame, they documented her exactly as she was found, moving with meticulous care through the heavy air of the crime scene.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text follows the traditional Japanese vertical right-to-left (tategaki) format. The title is large and bolded on the right, followed by the author and illustrator credits.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface typical of mid-century printing. Note the use of "ッ" (small tsu) at the ends of dialogue to indicate a sharp, clipped, or frantic tone.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "邪戀に狂う" (Maddened by Lust) is positioned highest, followed by the more sensational "エロ婆殺し" (Ero-Old Woman Murder). This layout is designed to grab the reader's attention with "Ero-Guro" (Erotic-Grotesque) appeal.
*   **Illustration:** The artwork is an ink-wash or woodblock-style illustration depicting the moment of the struggle or the discovery. It adds a visceral, noir-like quality to the story.
*   **Footer:** There is a page number "- 11 -" at the bottom center, suggesting this is an early page in a magazine or a short story collection.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Showa 22 / 1947):** This was the height of the "Kasutori" magazine era in post-war Japan. These magazines were cheap, printed on poor-quality paper (the word *kasutori* refers to dregs of sake), and focused on "3S" content: Sex, Screen, and Sports (or more broadly, Eroticism, Grotesque, and Nonsense).
*   **Ero-Guro-Nonsense:** This subculture, which began in the 1920s and saw a resurgence after WWII, blended eroticism with the macabre. The title "Ero-Old Woman" (エロ婆) is a classic example of this—using a provocative term to describe a victim who, in the text, is actually 63 years old.
*   **Hachioji:** A city in western Tokyo. Mentioning specific locations added a sense of "True Crime" realism, even if the story was fictionalized or exaggerated.
*   **Social Context:** The story reflects the instability and crime rates of post-war Japan, where "robbery-murders" (強盗殺人) were a significant public fear during the reconstruction period.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **邪戀 (Jaren):** Wicked, illicit, or depraved love. 
*   **エロ婆 (Ero-baba):** A derogatory/sensationalist term. In this context, it implies a woman of advanced age involved in some sort of sexual scandal or "lustful" situation, though the text focuses more on the murder.
*   **腦漿 (Nōshō):** Brain matter or "brain juice." A very common term in Guro literature to emphasize the visceral nature of a head injury.
*   **薪割斧 (Makiwari-ono):** A wood-splitting axe. A common household tool in the 1940s, frequently used as a weapon in rural/suburban crime stories.
*   **玉虫の背 (Tamamushi no se):** "The back of a jewel beetle." A specific literary trope used to describe the iridescent, shimmering quality of blood or oil, adding a disturbingly "beautiful" element to a grisly scene.
*   **斷末魔 (Danmatsuma):** The moment of death, or the "agony of death." It originates from Buddhist terminology.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and Sensationalism:** The text lingers on the physical state of the corpse (the brain matter, the yellow teeth, the hair). This is intended to satisfy the reader's morbid curiosity.
*   **Post-War Trauma:** The setting of Showa 22 (1947) is crucial. Japan was under Allied occupation, dealing with extreme poverty and a breakdown of social order. The "robber" lurking in the corner reflects the precariousness of domestic life at the time.
*   **The Contrast of Youth and Age:** The protagonist is 19, and the victim is 63. The title suggests "lust" or "eroticism," creating a subtext of forbidden or "twisted" sexual dynamics that were hallmarks of pulp fiction.
*   **Professionalism vs. Horror:** The detective's "professional" eye is contrasted with the "ghostly" atmosphere of the room, a common trope in detective noir to ground the supernatural/horrific in reality.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction / Pulp Fiction / Short Story.
*   **Genre:** Crime, Mystery, Ero-Guro (Erotic-Grotesque).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Murder, Post-war Japan, Sensationalism, Noir, True Crime Style.
*   **Classification:** Mature (Graphic descriptions of violence).
