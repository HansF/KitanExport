```
This text is a fascinating artifact from the Japanese "Kasutori" (pulp magazine) era of the late 1940s and early 1950s. It contains two distinct parts: a sensationalist narrative about a confrontation with street prostitutes ("Pan-pan girls") and a domestic drama script.

## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

路次に入つたのであつた。
　私たちは、すぐに取りかこまれているとすれば、パンパン宿を出るときから尾行されたのであろう。取りかこむがごとくジリジリ迫つてくる夜の女たちの群れのひとりのタバコの火がポイとすてられ、踏み消された。
　五、六名はいるかな。でも相手は女たちばかりのようである。あきらかに挑戦の氣配が感じられた。監視の輪がジリジリとせばめられてきたからである。女たちのはげしい息づかいを感じた。

**２　夜の女群と格闘す**

「ベニ子ぢやないか。こちらへおいで」
　彼女は、ベニ子という名らしい。私のうしろにかくれるようにして、ふるえている。
「こつちへ出ておいで。その男は、あたしがとつめるから。」
　彼女は、黙つて、小さくなつたままである。
「せわをやかせる娘だね。こいつ、にくいわ」と、しやがるじやないか」
　女の一人はいきなりグツと腕をのばして、ベニ子をひき倒そうとした。
「待て、ちょっと待て。」
　私は、ポイと女の腕を軽くたたいた。
「あいたツ、いたいわよ。」
　女は、悲鳴ににた金切聲をあげた。
　軽くさわつただけでも、唐手術の修行がものをいつた。
「君たちは、みんな女かい」
「それがどうしたの。女だと思つてなめるなよ」
「ベニ子をどうするというのかい」
「ベニ子は、こちらのもの。おまえさん、いらぬ干渉すると、めんどうなことになるよ。」
　そのときだつた。再び頭上を叩きつけるように、電車が通つた。私はくらくらと目まいを感じて、何か非常に憎悪に燃え立たないではいられなかつた。私は頭を左右にふりながら、正氣であることを自分に自信をもとうとした。
　自信はぐらぐらと足もとから、くずれはじめた。もはや意識をささえることは出来なかつたが、その境目で私のありつたけの狂燥性が爆発した。手と足を同時に躍らせて群りつく獲物に立ちむかつていた。
　ふれるものは、かならず傷ついたであろう。キャーッキャーッというベニ子のしぼるような叫びを最後に、私は完全に意識のけん外にノック、アウトされていた。
　私は最初強烈な刺激物で鼻を打たれ唇がしびれるのを感じ、多くの腕や足がからみついて、私のからだを倒そうとするのをはつきりと意識している。麻薬だ。それはたしかに麻薬の匂いだつた。私は決して、相手を女だとみくびつたのではない。二、三人を突き倒して、ベニ子を安全なところへ逃がしてやろうと思つただけであつた。
　しかし、彼女たちは、単にからかいではなかつた。それぞれ背後に強い力をもたなければ、自分以上の何かの武器をもつているものだ。麻薬もその一つであつた。
　相手の男を強引に自分の客として、つれ込む最後の手段に用いられることもあつた。この客は手ごわい。しかし金をもつている。または金になるもの、たとえば時計とか、寫眞機とか指輪とか、何かを身につけていると思つたら、強引に、それを獲得するために、肉体の押し売りをするのであつた。
　わたしがこれと見込んだら、絶対にものにして見せるわよ。彼女たちは、

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Into the alley, [we] entered.
We, if [we] were being immediately surrounded, from the time [we] left the Pan-pan lodging, must have been followed. Like surrounding [us], slowly approaching night women's group's one person's cigarette fire "poi" was thrown away, and stepped-extinguished.
Five, six people exist, I wonder. But the opponents were all women, it seems. Clearly the air of a challenge was felt. Because the circle of surveillance was slowly being narrowed. The women's heavy breathing [I] felt.

**2 Fighting with the Night Women**

"Is it not Beni-ko? Come over here."
She, Beni-ko called name seems to be. Like hiding behind me, [she] is shaking.
"Come out over here. That man, I will punish him."
She, remaining silent, remains small.
"A girl who makes [one] take care of [her]. This one, hateful," saying, isn't she?
One of the women suddenly "gui" extended [her] arm, and tried to pull Beni-ko down.
"Wait, wait a moment."
I, "poi" lightly tapped the woman's arm.
"Ouch, it's painful!"
The woman, a scream-like metallic voice let out.
Even just lightly touching, the Karate training told the tale.
"Are you all women?"
"What of that? Don't look down [on us] thinking [we are] women."
"What do you intend to do with Beni-ko?"
"Beni-ko is ours. You, if [you] do unneeded interference, troublesome things will happen."
It was that time. Again, as if striking the top of the head, a train passed. I, feeling dizzy, couldn't help but burn with a very great hatred. I, while shaking [my] head left and right, tried to have confidence in being sane.
Confidence, "gura-gura" from the feet, began to crumble. Already supporting consciousness was not possible, but at that boundary, all my franticness exploded. Dancing hands and feet simultaneously, [I] was facing the swarming prey.
Things that touched, surely were injured. "Kyaa-kyaa" Beni-ko's wringing-like scream at the end, I was completely knocked out outside the realm of consciousness.
I, first by a strong stimulant, [my] nose was hit, [my] lips felt numb, many arms and legs entangling, trying to knock down my body, I was clearly conscious of. Narcotic. It was certainly the smell of a narcotic. I never, underestimated the opponent as women. Only pushing down two or three people, and letting Beni-ko escape to a safe place, I thought.
However, they were not simply teasing. Unless they held a strong power behind each of them, they have some kind of weapon greater than themselves. Narcotics were one of those.
Forcibly taking the opponent man as their own customer, it was also used as a final means of dragging [them] in. This customer is tough. But [he] has money. Or things that become money, for example, a watch, a camera, a ring, if [they] thought [he] was wearing something, forcibly, to acquire that, they would do the "push-selling" of the flesh.
"If I decide on this [one], I will definitely make [him] mine." They...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

We ducked into the alley. If we were being surrounded—and it seemed we were—they must have been tailing us ever since we left the "Pan-pan" house. One of the women in the pack slowly closing in on us flicked away her cigarette and ground it out under her heel.
There were five or six of them, I reckoned, and they all appeared to be women. There was a palpable air of defiance about them as they tightened their circle. I could hear their heavy, jagged breathing.

**2. A Brawl with the Women of the Night**

"Well, if it isn't Beni-ko. Come over here, dear."
The girl's name was apparently Beni-ko. She was trembling, trying to make herself invisible behind my back.
"Come out here. I'll take care of this man myself," another woman barked.
Beni-ko stayed silent, huddling small.
"What a troublesome girl. You’re starting to annoy me," the woman sneered.
Suddenly, one of them lunged, grabbing for Beni-ko to pull her to the ground.
"Hold on, just a minute," I said, lightly parrying the woman's arm.
"Ow! That hurts!" she shrieked, her voice like grinding metal.
Even a light touch from someone trained in Karate was enough to make an impression.
"Are you all just women?" I asked.
"What’s it to you? Don't you dare underestimate us just because we're women."
"What do you want with Beni-ko?"
"She belongs to us. Mind your own business, mister, or things are going to get ugly."
Just then, a train thundered overhead, the noise like a physical blow to the skull. My head began to spin, and I felt a surge of uncontrollable loathing. I shook my head, trying desperately to cling to my senses.
But my footing felt unsteady, and my grip on reality began to crumble. At that razor's edge of consciousness, a frantic, primal energy exploded within me. My limbs lashed out instinctively at the "prey" swarming around me.
Anyone I touched must have come away bruised or broken. The last thing I heard was Beni-ko’s piercing scream before I was knocked out cold.
I remember the sharp, stinging sensation in my nose—some kind of chemical—and my lips going numb. I was aware of countless arms and legs tangling around me, trying to drag me down. It was a narcotic. I smelled it clearly. I hadn't made the mistake of underestimating them because they were women; I had only intended to knock a few aside so Beni-ko could escape.
But these women weren't just playing around. They were backed by something powerful, armed with weapons more dangerous than themselves—and narcotics were their weapon of choice.
They would use such means to force a man into becoming a customer. They saw me as a tough mark, but one who had money—or at least things that could be turned into money, like a watch, a camera, or a ring. To get what they wanted, they were prepared to "sell" their bodies by force.
"Once I've set my sights on a man, I never let him go," they seemed to say...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This is a page from a Japanese "Kasutori" magazine (named after a cheap, potent shochu), popular during the post-war Occupation era.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of traditional and slightly modernized kanji. The font is a standard serif (Mincho) style typical of mid-20th-century printing. Note the use of "唐手術" for Karate, an older term.
*   **Layout:** The page is split into two distinct editorial zones. The top two-thirds contain a sensationalist prose narrative in two vertical columns. The bottom third contains a dialogue-based script (likely a short humorous play or "skit").
*   **Illustration:** A stylized, charcoal or ink illustration sits in the center-right. It depicts a woman in a state of distress or repose, with a man's face looming near her. The art style is typical of the "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) pulp aesthetic of the time.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "２ 夜の女群と格闘す" is set in a slightly larger, bold font to catch the reader's eye.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Pan-pan Girls (パンパンガール):** This term refers to street prostitutes who catered primarily to the Allied Occupation forces (GIs) and Japanese men in the devastation following WWII. They were a common sight in districts like Ginza and Shinjuku.
*   **Pan-pan Lodgings (パンパン宿):** Illegal or semi-legal brothels or boarding houses where these women lived and worked.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The period between 1946 and 1955 saw a boom in cheap, sensationalist magazines that focused on "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Eroticism, Grotesquerie, and Nonsense). They provided escapism and reflected the raw, desperate social conditions of the time.
*   **Crime & Narcotics:** The mention of "narcotics" (likely ether or another inhalant) used by prostitutes to incapacitate and rob marks reflects the high crime rates and the lawlessness of the black-market era (Yami-ichi).
*   **Karate (唐手術):** The use of the older characters "唐手" (Tang/Chinese Hand) instead of "空手" (Empty Hand) is a period-specific spelling that was still in transition in the mid-century.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **路次 (Roji):** An alley or narrow street.
*   **ジリジリ (Jiri-jiri):** Onomatopoeia for something approaching slowly or a situation becoming tense.
*   **金切聲 (Kanaki-goe):** A shrill, metallic, or piercing scream.
*   **唐手術 (Tou-jutsu/Karate):** Martial arts. The narrator uses this to explain his physical prowess.
*   **意識のけん外 (Ishiki no kengai):** Literally "outside the sphere of consciousness"; knocked unconscious.
*   **肉体の押し売り (Nikutai no oshiuri):** Literally "forced selling of the flesh." A euphemism for forced prostitution or a honey trap leading to robbery.
*   **腰巻 (Koshimaki):** A traditional Japanese underskirt or loincloth-like wrap worn by women, mentioned in the lower script to suggest a scandalous proximity/affair.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Urban Danger and Lawlessness:** The alleyway setting and the predatory "pack" of women highlight the perceived dangers of post-war urban life.
*   **The "Vamp" Archetype:** The women are portrayed as predatory and dangerous, using both their bodies and chemicals (narcotics) to trap men. This reflects a male anxiety regarding the changing social roles and the perceived "toughness" of women surviving the ruins.
*   **Misogyny vs. Survival:** While the text frames the women as villains, it also implicitly acknowledges their desperation—robbing men of watches and cameras as a "final means" of survival.
*   **Juxtaposition of High and Low:** The top story is a gritty "noir" action piece, while the bottom story is a "home drama" or light comedy about a jealous wife. This contrast was common in Kasutori magazines to provide a variety of "titillations" and entertainment.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Pulp/Noir), Script (Comedy/Drama).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Occupation Era, Prostitution (Pan-pan), Martial Arts, Crime, Domestic Jealousy, Kasutori Culture.
*   **Classification:** Adult-oriented (mild sensationalism/eroticism).
