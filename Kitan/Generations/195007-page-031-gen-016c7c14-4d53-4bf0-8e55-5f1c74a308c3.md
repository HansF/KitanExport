一、獵奇の街 神戸

夜食後、ふらりとホテルを出た僕は、いつの間にか薄闇に蔽はれた三宮駅のガード下に出ていました。隨分歩いたらしく、腕時計は既に九時を過ぎていました。
街路樹に点綴する街燈は、だゝッ廣い、アスファルト路を斑蛇の背のように照して、空は低く、星一つ瞬いていませんでした。高架を通る電車の轟音で冷たい空氣が、こまかく震えました。
僕は、國際都市神戸のどこに、怪奇があり惨虐があり、戰慄、恐怖があり、そして残酷な歡樂境があるのかを探し求めるように、あちこちを眺めながら歩いていました。
氣まぐれだつたかも知れません。十一月の白い月が右手の倉庫の屋根の上に縮み上つてゐる夜。獵奇の港神戸の夜を僕のような田舎者が一人歩くなんて、まことに無鐵砲だつたかも知れません。
僕は、鼻紙を切り抜いて空へはりつけたような月を六十度の角度で眺めながら、薄暗い倉庫の通りを眞直ぐに、とある明るい六間道路を横切ろうとしました。すると、
「モシ、モシ――」
軽い不安に引かれて、振り返ると、葉つぱのなくなつた柳の下で、
「いかがです。旦那、ヘヘ、……」
と、しゃくるような顔で、リンタクのハンドルを、松の木のような腕で握つている男がにた～と笑つています。
僕は、まごつきました。そのまごつきを見てとつた車夫は
「いかがです。面白い所へ御案内しましょうか。いいところがありますよ」
と僕に、すれ～に寄つて
「へへ、……。今夜はお一人では寒過ぎる」
「寒いね！」
僕もつられて微笑を刻んだ。

Weird Tale
**Mermaid Secret-Manufacturing Cave**
Satomi Teruharu
Illustration by Sanpei

1. Bizarre-Hunting City Kobe

After dinner, aimlessly having left the hotel, I found myself, before I knew it, under the Sannomiya Station tracks covered in dim darkness. Having walked quite a bit, it seemed, my wristwatch had already passed nine o'clock.
The streetlights punctuating the roadside trees illuminated the wide asphalt road like the back of a speckled snake, the sky was low, and not a single star was twinkling. With the roar of the trains passing on the elevated tracks, the cold air trembled finely.
I was walking while looking here and there, as if seeking where in the international city of Kobe there was mystery, there was cruelty, there was shivering, there was fear, and where a cruel pleasure-ground might be.
It might have been a whim. A night when the white November moon was shriveled up over the roofs of the warehouses on the right. For a country bumpkin like me to walk alone in the night of the bizarre-hunting port of Kobe might have been truly reckless.
While looking at the moon, which looked like it was cut out of a paper tissue and pasted onto the sky, at a sixty-degree angle, I tried to cross a certain bright six-ken (approx. 11m) wide road from the dim warehouse street. Then,
"Excuse me, excuse me—"
Drawn by a light unease, I looked back, and under a willow tree that had lost its leaves,
"How about it, Master? Heh-heh..."
With a face like it was sobbing, a man gripping the handlebars of a cycle-taxi with arms like pine trees was grinning.
I was flustered. The driver, having caught that flustered state, said,
"How about it? Shall I guide you to an interesting place? There’s a good spot."
Closing in right next to me, he said,
"Heh-heh... It's too cold to be alone tonight."
"It is cold, isn't it!"
I also, drawn in, etched a smile.

A Weird Tale
**The Secret Mermaid Workshop**
By Satomi Teruharu
Illustrated by Sanpei

1. Kobe: City of the Macabre

After dinner, I drifted out of my hotel and soon found myself beneath the dark, looming overpass of Sannomiya Station. I must have been walking for some time; my watch already showed past nine.
The streetlights, interspersed among the roadside trees, cast a glow across the sprawling asphalt that resembled the scaly back of a viper. The sky hung low, devoid of a single star. Every time a train thundered along the elevated tracks, the biting night air seemed to shudder.
I wandered through the streets of this international port, my eyes searching for the hidden pockets of Kobe—searching for the strange, the cruel, the thrilling, and the terrifying. I was looking for some dark, decadent paradise of pleasure.
Perhaps it was merely a whim. It was a November night, with a pale moon huddled over the warehouse roofs to my right. For a rustic fellow like myself to be prowling the shadows of such a notorious port alone was, perhaps, the height of recklessness.
I was gazing up at the moon—which looked like a scrap of tissue paper snipped out and pasted onto the sky—at a sharp sixty-degree angle, just as I moved to cross from a dim alley of warehouses onto a well-lit thoroughfare. Suddenly, a voice called out.
"Pardon me, sir... Pardon me..."
A prickle of unease made me turn. There, beneath a leafless willow tree, stood a man.
"How about it, Governor? Heh, heh..."
His face was twisted into a strange, sobbing grimace. He gripped the handlebars of a cycle-taxi with arms as gnarled as old pine branches, a greasy smirk plastered across his face.
I faltered, momentarily taken aback. Sensing my hesitation, the driver pressed closer.
"How about it? Care for a tour of somewhere... interesting? I know just the place."
He leaned in until he was nearly brushing against me.
"Heh, heh... It's far too cold to be wandering alone tonight."
"It certainly is," I replied, a small, involuntary smile etching itself onto my face.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Genre Layout:** The page is typical of *Kasutori* magazines or "weird tale" (怪奇探偵 - *kaiki tantei*) pulps from the post-war era.
*   **Typography:** The main title is set in a large, bold, slightly stylized font to grab attention. The subtitle "獵奇の街 神戸" (Kobe: City of Bizarre-hunting) uses a standard bold font. The body text is set in traditional vertical columns (tategaki), reading right-to-left.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration dominates the top half of the page, bleeding into the title area. The title and author are placed prominently on the right. The text begins with a numbered section, indicating a serialized or multi-part story.
*   **Illustration Style:** The artwork by "Sanpei" is surreal and evocative of the *Ero-Guro* (Erotic-Grotesque) style. It features a collage of elements: a gnarled hand, a spider, a building with a spire (suggesting a church or a western-style institution), and a creature that appears to have a scaly, mermaid-like body but a human face. This reflects the "weird" and "mysterious" theme of the story.
*   **Design Features:** The page number "-32-" at the bottom is flanked by decorative dashes. The use of small circles (iteration marks) like "にた～と" and "すれ～に" is a common stylistic choice in mid-century Japanese printing for emphasis or to indicate a trailing sound.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-war 1940s-50s):** The setting and terminology strongly suggest the immediate post-war period. This was an era of poverty and social upheaval, but also a boom in "decadent" literature and "weird" mystery pulps.
*   **Kobe as an "International City":** Kobe has long been one of Japan's most prominent port cities, known for its foreign influence, Western-style architecture (the *Ijinkan*), and a perceived "exotic" and slightly dangerous atmosphere. It was a favorite setting for hardboiled and mystery fiction.
*   **Rintaku (輪タク):** Short for "bicycle taxi" (*jitensha takushi*). These pedicabs were ubiquitous in Japanese cities immediately after WWII due to extreme fuel shortages that made motorized taxis rare. The presence of a *rintaku* driver immediately dates the story to the late 1940s or very early 1950s.
*   **The "Ryōki" (猟奇) Boom:** The word *ryōki* (seeking the strange/bizarre) became a massive cultural keyword in the Shōwa era (especially the late 1920s-30s and again in the post-war period). It refers to a fascination with the grotesque, the macabre, and the fringe elements of urban life.
*   **Sannomiya Station (三宮駅):** A major transit hub in Kobe. The "guard-shita" (under the tracks) areas were (and some still are) known for narrow alleys, small bars, and a somewhat gritty atmosphere.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **怪奇譚 (Kaikitan):** A "weird tale" or story of the supernatural/strange. A popular genre tag.
*   **猟奇 (Ryōki):** Bizarre-hunting; curiosity-seeking; macabre. It conveys a specific sense of seeking out the grotesque or hidden "dark side" of society.
*   **密造窟 (Mitsuzōkutsu):** Literally "secret manufacturing cave/den." Often used for illegal stills or counterfeit operations. Here, combined with "Mermaid," it suggests something much more sinister and surreal.
*   **点綴 (Tentetsu):** To be scattered here and there; to intersperse. A literary term.
*   **斑蛇 (Hanja/Madarahebi):** A speckled or mottled snake. The comparison of the road to a snake's back is a classic hardboiled/noir trope.
*   **享楽境 (Kanrakukyō):** A pleasure district or a place of decadent amusement.
*   **無鉄砲 (Muteppō):** Reckless; daredevil; thoughtless.
*   **鼻紙 (Hanagami):** Literally "nose paper," i.e., a tissue or scrap of paper.
*   **六間道路 (Rokken-dōro):** A road measuring six *ken* in width (approx. 11 meters). *Ken* is a traditional unit of measurement.
*   **リンタク (Rintaku):** A bicycle taxi (pedicab).
*   **車夫 (Shafu):** A rickshaw or pedicab puller/driver.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Urban Noir & The Flâneur:** The protagonist is a "country bumpkin" (*inak amono*) wandering the dark, "international" city. He is a modern version of the flâneur, seeking stimulation and "shivers" in the urban landscape.
*   **The Grotesque vs. The Mundane:** The moon is compared to a piece of tissue paper, and the road to a snake. These metaphors flatten the distinction between the natural world and the artificial/dirty city, setting a tone of unease.
*   **Post-War Desperation:** The *rintaku* driver, with his gnarled arms and "sobbing" face, represents the gritty, desperate reality of post-war life. He acts as a "gatekeeper" to the "interesting places" (the underworld) the protagonist seeks.
*   **The Allure of the Forbidden:** The title "Mermaid Secret Manufacturing Cave" and the protagonist's search for "cruel pleasure grounds" suggest a subtext of illicit desires and the dark side of urban modernization.
