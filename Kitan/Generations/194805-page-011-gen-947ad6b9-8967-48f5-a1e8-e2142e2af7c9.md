## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The traditional music section suddenly, of melancholy-like tempo, entered the stage.
The lighting gathered upon her, the eyes of all spectators were simultaneously observing her.
That moment! *Putsun* (snap) the dull sound along with it, Tetsuko-san's pants' elastic snapped.
That person was dancing without caring. When she noticed, the malicious pants slipped off, and the sight of the barren hill, appearing as if oily, was in the center of the fierce spotlight.
*Atsu* (Ah!) she cried out, at that time the audience came falling down.
The band, knowing nothing, sends the sound of the large drum onto the stage.
Tetsuko-san, surprised, pulled them up with one hand, but if she released her hand, they slipped down *Nuru* (slickly).
The crowd bursts into laughter and cheers. "Venus, splendid!" "Just like that, dance more!" Such heckles fly out.
Tetsuko-san, who until now had the face of an imposing lord (*O-tono*), was now wearing a face of pathos, not shame.
Tetsuko-san, unable to cry or stop, in the predicament where she could neither dance nor run away, shook the body that had been exposed.
She could no longer be stopped by anyone, and since she was also hungry, she could not give up over just this, on the stage, Togaga, like a madman, was yelling, "Close the curtain!"

And, it seems that the reason Tetsuko-san danced on the street corner was to save her own family member. Someone said she wanted to dance wearing the sweets that Shimada Manzoku was using.
No one expected Venus would dance on the street corner. However, it was not that she expressed it; the dissection of the expression was not possible.
Sometime, Togaga, who came dropping the key, having entered into the heart of the apple, shook hands, whistled, and furthermore, the Japanese newspaper, holding the band in a T-shirt, not knowing anything, sends the sound of the large drum onto the stage.
Tetsuko-san, surprised, pulled them up with one hand, but if she released her hand, they slipped down *Nuru* (slickly).
The crowd bursts into laughter and cheers.

...you might be doing, but even so, amid the thunderous applause, someone whistled vulgarly.
Following the heckling, there were also people who practiced their tricks on the street.
Among them were students specializing in riding/acrobatics, and there were also people who did playful things like respectfully presenting her with hair restorer.

Starting the next day, Tetsuko-san was soaked in tears all day, and her friends felt the resentment of this truly unfortunate irresistible force, which Togaga carved into me as irreverent chance.
But I, appreciating the one safety-cutter sword I kept in my breast pocket, carefully enclosed its blade in my pencil case, protecting my yet-great achievements even from inefficient irresistible force.
Held between my sleeves, the absolute sword that accomplishes that grave mission, its secret is deeply known only by the safety-cutter sword and me alone.
Ah, Oh, completely naked Venus.
I beg forgiveness for the sin, grant it to her. Then, retribution must be carried out.
Amen men. (End)

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The traditional orchestra suddenly shifted, commencing the performance in a tempo steeped in melancholy. The spotlight converged upon her, and the gazes of the entire audience were fixed intently on her.
It was at that moment! *Snap*—a dull sound—and the elastic of Tetsuko's pants broke. She had been dancing without a care in the world. When she realized what happened, the troublesome pants slipped off, revealing a bare patch of skin, slick and starkly visible under the intense spotlight, like a barren, oily hill.
She cried out, "Ah!" just as the audience erupted.
The band, oblivious, continued to blast the sound of the bass drum onto the stage. Startled, Tetsuko desperately grabbed the pants, pulling them up with one hand, but the moment she let go, they slid smoothly back down.
The crowd roared with laughter and cheers. "Venus, you're magnificent!" "Just like that, dance more!" they yelled, hurling abuse.
Tetsuko, who moments before had displayed an imposing, lordly demeanor, now wore a face of sorrow, not shame. Unable to cry or stop, caught in a terrible dilemma—she could neither continue dancing nor flee—she simply shook her exposed body in place.
There was no stopping anyone now. And because she was hungry, she couldn't simply give up over this small incident. On stage, Togaga, like a madman, screamed, "Close the curtain!"

And it appeared that Tetsuko-san had danced on the street corner previously to save a family member. Someone mentioned that she was eager to dance wearing the "Sweets" outfit that Shimada Manzoku used.
No one could have imagined Venus dancing on a street corner. Yet, it wasn't about her performance; the analysis of the performance itself was lacking. Unnoticed, Togaga, who had come dropping a key, having slipped into the heart of the Apple, performed a handshake and whistle, trying to obscure whether the audience knew Venus was performing. Furthermore, the Japanese newspaper, holding the band in T-shirts, continued playing the great drum, completely unaware. Tetsuko, surprised, pulled them up with one hand, but the moment she let go, they slid smoothly back down. The crowd roared with laughter and cheers.

...[Although] you might be doing that, even amidst the booming applause, vulgar whistles still rang out. Following the heckling, there were people who performed street tricks. Among them were students specializing in riding (acrobatics) who performed facetious stunts, like respectfully presenting her with hair restorer.

From the very next day, Tetsuko was soaked in tears all day long. Her friends resented this truly unfortunate catastrophe, which Togaga had carved into me as an act of insolent chance.
But I, grateful for the single safety-cutter knife I carried close to my heart, carefully tucked its blade away in my pencil case, protecting my still-great achievements even from inefficient irresistible force. Concealed within my sleeve, the absolute blade that executes that grave mission—its secret is profoundly known only by the safety-cutter and myself.
Oh, wholly naked Venus.
I confess the sin, grant her absolution. Thus, retribution must surely follow.
Amen. (End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is presented in a traditional Japanese format: vertical columns read right-to-left (R-L).

**Illustration and Layout:** A large, striking line drawing dominates the left-center of the page, depicting a woman's profile (likely the dancer, Venus/Tetsuko), drawn with simple, slightly angular lines typical of mid-century serialized illustration. The illustration forces the text to wrap around its edges, creating extremely narrow and fragmented columns in the middle of the page.

**Structure and Flow:**
1.  **Right Column (Introduction to Climax):** Sets the scene (stage, lighting, music change) and narrates the core climax: the pants elastic snapping (プツン), the exposure, and the immediate, chaotic reaction of the audience (laughter, heckling).
2.  **Middle Columns (Narrative Fragmentation/Repetition):** This section is highly disjointed due to the illustration wrapping. It provides fragmented backstory (Tetsuko's street dancing motive, the character Togaga, the Apple/key incident) and bafflingly, *repeats* the description of the band's ignorance and Tetsuko's inability to keep her pants up ("バンドは何も知らずに大管鼓の風を舞台に送つて来ます..."). This duplication is almost certainly a printing or typesetting error in the original publication.
3.  **Left Columns (Aftermath and Conclusion):** Describes the immediate aftermath (vulgar audience actions, the "hair restorer" joke) and transitions into the narrator's philosophical, highly personal reflection involving the concepts of "irresistible force" (不可抗力), Togaga, and the symbolic "safety-cutter sword" (安全割剣), ending with a dramatic, theological pronouncement and the story marker (終).

**Typography:** Standard Minchō (serif) typeface is used throughout. Historical kana usage (ゐる, ゐた, etc.) is consistent, dating the text stylistically or historically to the pre-1946 orthographic reforms, or a literary style mimicking that era. The page number "- 11 -" is centered at the bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Publication Era (1940s–1960s):** The historical kana usage (*rekishiteki kanazukai*) suggests the text either predates the 1946 reform or was published shortly after in a publication aiming for a highly literary, traditional, or slightly anti-modern aesthetic. The subject matter—a dramatic, scandalous burlesque or modern dance performance involving stripping/exposure—is consistent with the popular entertainment of post-war Japan (especially the 1950s), where theaters and cabarets flourished after years of strict wartime censorship.

**Thematic Context:** The contrast between the formal traditional music (邦楽部) and the "Venus" performance highlights the clash between old Japanese culture and burgeoning modern, often scandalous, Westernized entertainment.

**Key Terminology and References:**
*   **邦楽部 (Hōgaku-bu):** Traditional Japanese music section, used here ironically or contrastingly to score a striptease/modern dance routine.
*   **ヴィーナス (Venus):** Clearly referencing the Roman goddess of love, beauty, and desire, establishing the dancer's persona as an idealized (and nude) figure.
*   **島田まんぞく (Shimada Manzoku):** A name mentioned in connection with a "Sweets" costume. Likely a reference to a contemporary popular comedian, actor, or entertainer of the era, adding a layer of contemporary cultural reference.
*   **乗専の生徒さん (Jōsen no Seito-san):** Students specializing in "riding" (乗専), possibly acrobatics, or perhaps a euphemism for a type of street performance or gang activity, implying low-class or street-level hecklers.
*   **毛生薬を謹呈 (Mōseyaku o Kinzei):** Presenting hair restorer respectfully. This is a cruel, mocking joke aimed at the dancer, possibly implying she is older or has thinning hair, demonstrating the vulgarity of the crowd.
*   **安全割剣 (Anzen Wariken):** Literally "safety-cutter/divider sword." This is the central symbolic object. It suggests a safety razor blade (common in the era), a small sharp tool, or perhaps a letter opener. The narrator treats it with immense reverence, symbolizing truth, protection, and esoteric knowledge, elevating a mundane object to a spiritual artifact.

**Tone:** The language is highly melodramatic, philosophical, and intensely personal (first-person narration by the individual obsessed with Venus and Togaga).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

| Term | Original Reading/Usage | Modern Equivalent/Meaning | Contextual Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ゐる/ゐた | Iru/Ita (Historical kana) | いる/いた | Standard historical orthography (pre-1946 reform). |
| 邦楽部 | Hōgaku-bu | Traditional Japanese Music Section | Juxtaposed against the Western-style theatrical scandal. |
| 眸 | Hitomi | Eye/Pupil | Highly literary word for eye, emphasizing the intense gaze of the crowd. |
| プツン | Putsun | Snap/Ping (onomatopoeia) | The sudden sound of the elastic breaking, triggering the catastrophe. |
| 経潤の見える不毛の丘 | Keijun no mieru fumō no oka | Barren hill appearing oily/greasy | Euphemistic, highly literary/grotesque description of exposed pubic area/belly under harsh light. "経潤" (Keijun) is obscure, possibly implying 'greasy' or 'oily texture'. |
| 大管鼓 | Daikan-ko | Bass drum/Large pipe drum | The massive drum continuing the beat, oblivious to the disaster, heightening the tragicomic element. |
| 羣衆 | Gunshū | Crowd/Masses | Old form of 群衆. Used to emphasize the uncontrolled, vulgar nature of the audience. |
| 牡殿 | O-tono | Lord/Gentleman | Used here in a derogatory or ironic sense ("O-tono no kao"), possibly meaning "stiff/imposing/haughty" face, contrasting with her later "pathos." Could be a printing error for another kanji. |
| トガガ | Togaga | Togaga (Character name) | A key, mysterious figure (antagonist/narrator’s rival) associated with the key and the accidental exposure, later described as "carving insolent chance" into the narrator. |
| 戯骨なヤツ | Gikotsu na yatsu | Playful/Facetious fellow | Used to describe the vulgar hecklers who perform mocking stunts. |
| 安全割剣 | Anzen Wariken | Safety-Cutter/Razor Sword | The narrator’s symbolic, sacred object, representing esoteric knowledge and self-protection against "irresistible force." |
| 因果應報 | Inga Ōhō | Karmic Retribution/Justice | A Buddhist concept used by the narrator in the concluding, quasi-religious plea for justice. |

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**The Catastrophe of Control vs. Chaos (不可抗力):** The central theme is the devastating impact of random, uncontrollable misfortune (*fukakōryoku*, irresistible force). Tetsuko's careful, professional performance is ruined by a tiny mechanical failure (a broken rubber band). This accident strips her of her glamour (Venus) and her dignity, forcing her to confront reality.

**The Narrator's Obsession and Delusion:** The text is narrated by an intense first-person observer who appears obsessed with Tetsuko (Venus) and her fate, linking her public humiliation directly to the mysterious figure Togaga, whom he sees as having "carved insolent chance" into him. The narrator elevates his mundane "safety-cutter" into a spiritual "absolute sword" (絶刀) capable of achieving a "grave mission," indicating profound psychological instability or highly stylized literary delusion.

**Public Spectacle and Degradation:** The audience's response—shifting from amusement to vulgar, cruel heckling ("dance more!") and mocking jokes (hair restorer)—transforms the stage into a site of public degradation. The scene critiques the inhumanity of the mass audience when confronted with vulnerability.

**Redemption and Karmic Justice:** The conclusion is a sudden shift to quasi-religious language (Amen, confession of sin, plea for retribution/因果應報). The narrator seeks to reconcile the tragedy through a spiritual lens, begging for absolution for Venus and demanding karmic balance, suggesting the event holds cosmic significance for him.
