## Literal English Translation

[She is] a woman I hunted while [she was] loitering about. Incidentally, I should add in writing that restaurants inside department stores and rooftop playgrounds are perfect for married-woman hunting. I have hunted five married women so far.

Yasue is small-framed, but a fat woman of about 60 kilos; when she rides on my knees, a skinny man like me feels as if he will be crushed.
With this Yasue, I finished with normal sex the first time, but from the second time, I suddenly began *shibari* (binding). At first, as is standard, it was with the sash of a hotel yukata, but immediately I began binding with rope.
This is because Yasue was terribly lecherous (*kōshoku*) and was a woman starving for strange stimulation. For doing SM play, there is nothing easier to handle than a lecherous woman. I showed her not only SM magazines but also *shunga* (erotic woodcuts) and *shunpon* (erotic books), and went on "rearing" (*shiiku*) Yasue into an increasingly lecherous woman.

Conveniently, Yasue's husband, due to work circumstances, repeated a life of going out to the countryside for one month and returning home for one week, so during the month the husband was absent, we could indulge in SM play more and more. When I did not know that, I thought "It would be bad if the husband saw the skin with rope marks remaining," but after hearing Yasue's story, I bound her up tightly without hesitation.

Because Yasue is fat, she finds things like the cross-legged tie painful and cannot continue them for long, but tortures that expose her shameful parts, such as the open-leg tie or the one-leg suspension, she rather gladly accepts. On top of that, if I do vibrator torture, she overflows with love fluids to an amazing degree and writhes in madness.

When I see a fat woman, I excessively want to slap her buttocks, and Yasue was no exception to that.
With both hands tied behind her back, I make Yasue, whose body is tied folded in two, stick out her huge buttocks—which look like they would take an armful to hold—high up; the pleasure when I slap them *bishi-bishi* (smacking sound) with a whip is quite something. Naturally, Yasue raises screams that are indistinguishable between screams of pain and joy, but when it becomes too severe, I made her hold my thing in her mouth instead of a monkey-gag (*sarugutsuwa*).

I am one who does not prefer the Enema Play (*kanchou play*) that is popular these days, but...

## Literary English Translation

She is a woman I "hunted" while she was idling about. I should note, for the record, that department store restaurants and rooftop amusement areas are the perfect grounds for hunting married women. I have claimed five such housewives to date.

Yasue has a small frame, but she is a plump woman of nearly sixty kilograms. When she sits on my lap, a skinny man like myself feels nearly crushed under the weight.
With Yasue, I kept things to standard intercourse the first time, but from our second meeting, I abruptly introduced bondage. I started, as is custom, with a hotel yukata sash, but quickly graduated to rope.
I did this because Yasue was terribly amorous—a woman starving for deviant stimulation. When it comes to S&M, there is nothing easier to manage than a woman with a lecherous appetite. I trained her, using not only S&M magazines but also traditional *shunga* and erotic texts, rearing her into an even more insatiable creature.

As luck would have it, Yasue’s husband worked a schedule that took him to the countryside for a month at a time, returning for only a week. Consequently, during the month of his absence, we could indulge in S&M play with abandon. before I knew this schedule, I used to worry, thinking, "It would be trouble if her husband saw the rope marks on her skin." But once Yasue explained the situation, I began to bind her tightly, grinding the ropes in without hesitation.

Because Yasue is heavy, she finds positions like the cross-legged tie painful and cannot endure them for long. However, she gladly accepts tortures that expose her private parts, such as the open-leg tie or the single-leg suspension. Furthermore, if I apply a vibrator, she writhes in ecstasy, overflowing with juices to a degree that leaves one astounded.

Whenever I see a fleshy woman, I am seized by an overwhelming urge to slap her buttocks; Yasue was no exception.
I bind her hands behind her back and fold her body in two, forcing her to thrust her massive hips—broad enough to require a full embrace—high into the air. The pleasure I derive from whipping them with a sharp *crack* is considerable. Naturally, Yasue lets out cries that hover between anguish and rapture. When her screaming becomes too intense, I force my member into her mouth to serve as a gag.

I, for one, have no taste for the "enema play" that is currently in vogue, but...

### 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

```markdown
## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Genre:** "Jitsuwa" (True Story) / Ero-Guro Nonsense. This is likely a fictionalized "reader submission" or a column written by a recurring author posing as a seasoned dominant male.
*   **Narrative Voice:** The narrator adopts a clinical, detached, yet boastful persona. He positions himself as a "Hunter" and "Trainer" (Shiiku), utilizing specific jargon to establish authority within the subculture.
*   **Target Audience:** Adult men in the Showa era (likely late 1950s to mid-1960s). The text appeals to fantasies of dominating married women (infidelity), navigating the logistical freedom of the husband's absence, and the fetishization of specific body types ("plump" women).
*   **Layout:** The text is set in standard vertical columns but is clearly designed to frame the central photograph. The photograph serves as a "visual proof" or illustration of the techniques described (specifically the "folded in two" posture mentioned in the text).
```

### 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

```markdown
## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Department Store Rooftops (Okujou):** In the mid-Showa era, department store rooftops were major social hubs with small amusement parks, beer gardens, and cafes. The text identifies these as prime spots for "hunting" bored housewives, reflecting the social geography of the time.
*   **"Hunting" (Hanto):** A loanword popular in the postwar era referring to picking up women (nanpa). The specific focus on *hito-zuma* (married women) taps into the "danchi-zuma" (apartment complex wife) pornography boom that gained traction in the 1960s.
*   **Body Standards:** Yasue is described as "fat" at 60kg (approx. 132 lbs). In modern Western context, this is average, but in postwar Japan (where malnutrition was a recent memory and average height was lower), 60kg on a "small frame" would indeed be considered "plump" or "fleshy."
*   **The Absent Husband:** The husband works away for a month, returning for a week. This reflects the intense corporate demands of the Japanese "Economic Miracle" period, where *tanshin funin* (job transfer without family) or long absences were common, creating a trope of the lonely, sexually frustrated wife left behind.
*   **Enema Play (Kanchou):** The narrator mentions this is "popular these days" (*sakkon hayari no*). This dates the text somewhat, as enema fetishes saw specific booms in underground magazines in the late 50s and 60s as a subset of medical play.

### 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes

```markdown
## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **綁り (Shibari):** The text uses the kanji `綁` (radical *ito* + *hou*) instead of the standard `縛`. This character is rarer and often adds a nuance of "arrest" or "capture," preferred in SM literature for its aesthetic.
*   **飼育 (Shiiku):** "Breeding" or "Rearing" (animals). Used here to describe the "training" of the woman, emphasizing dehumanization and the owner/pet dynamic.
*   **春本 (Shunpon):** "Spring Books." An older Edo-period term for pornography. Its use alongside "SM magazines" suggests the narrator views himself as a connoisseur of erotica across history.
*   **猿ぐつわ (Sarugutsuwa):** Lit. "Monkey bit." A gag used to silence someone.
*   **あぐら綁り (Agura-nawari):** "Cross-legged bind." A specific bondage posture.

### 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

```markdown
## Themes & Subtext

*   **Corruption of the Domestic:** The narrator takes a "hunted" housewife—a symbol of domestic stability—and "trains" her using pornography and rope. The use of the *hotel yukata sash* as the gateway drug to *rope* symbolizes the transition from normative sex to fetishism.
*   **Voyeurism & Shame:** The narrator emphasizes postures that "expose the shameful parts" (*chibu wo sarasu*). The pleasure is derived not just from the sensation, but from the humiliation of exposure.
*   **Masculine Fragility/Compensation:** The narrator describes himself as "skinny" and easily crushed by the "fat" woman. His use of ropes, whips, and "training" serves to reassert dominance over a physical presence that naturally overwhelms him.

### 9️⃣ Content Flags

## Content Classification Tags
