港々の乙女
内海の娼樓
中原春美

瀬戸内海の地図をひろげて見ると屋島、壇ノ浦、一の谷と、幾多の古戦場が、その昔の歴史を眼のあたりに展開してくれるのである。
然しそれは昔を偲ぶよすがとしての地名であり、海岸であり島である。内海は、今も昔も漁場として沿岸の村々を支えたことに變りはない。
それと共に、籠と馬と徒歩が陸上の代表的な交通機關であつた時代には百石、二百石の船旅こそ、唯一のハイスピードの多量の輸送機關であつた。従つて、堺から馬關へ、中國から四國への物産の輸送には十日も一月も家を外に、これら船頭の海上生活が續けられた。
昔も今も旅窓の佗びしさを慰めるものは、酒であり、女である。まして板子一枚下は地獄の海上生活者は港々の女に、憧れを求め、これがあるによつて、二月八月の大暴風も堪えることが出来た、苦しい船路を一飛びに夢心地となることが出来た港の乙女！
此れが國際都市上海であれ、マルセイユであれ、ヴェニスであれ、横濱であれ、或は徳川時代の博多であれ、堺浦であれ、海岸沿いに立ち並ぶ豪華な妓樓が先づ見られた。
それに寄生するところの商家の發達が、現在の海港都市を作つたと言つても過言ではない。
徳川時代の政治的、經濟的に、太平を謳つた時代には、この遊女の生活も又至極平和そのもの、夢のようなものであつた。明治時代以降、せち辛い生活がおしよつて来て、遊女は完全に性の取引者、肉体の提供者として機械的なサービスに堕し去つたのであるが、その以前を辿れば、夢のような戀愛市場であり、旅人の滯在中を、女房氣取りで、その夫の洗濯もしてやれば、相談相手ともなる、本當の慰め役、エキストラ女房をつとめた。
強盗、殺人、と行きづまつた現代の世相にこそ、との様な慰安所、魂をとかすような戀愛市場も必要であるが、金、金、金をと、さながら金の申し子のような性取引市場はあつても、のんびりとした昔の妓の世界は夢物語である。
しかし山陽線の大驛の近くに、昔さながらの港の町、女の港があるから紹介したい。廣島縣下、瀬戸内海に面して、中國と四國を繋ぐ最短距離である。
ボーボーと貨物船が汽笛を鳴らして沖からくる。陸ではまるで戦場のような騒ぎ、それぞれの傳馬舟に、パーマネントの娘子軍がとび乗り、いせい沖の船めがけて、よいしよよいしよと船頭の力漕で攻撃する。先着順に従つて、船長からパーサー、機關長、運轉手と、高級船員から油差しの水夫の部屋まで突進する。
日本で唯一の海上エロ、飢えたマドロス達は、それぞれ性的契約が成立して半日を、一日を陸の人魚の愛撫にすごして命の洗濯をするのである。
漸く遅れてサンパンに沖仲仕が満載されて到着する。ウインチが運轉して荷役が始まる。
やがてボツボツ臨時の中の房を出て洗濯をしてやるのもあれば朝風の甲板で髪をかきあげている妓もあるとゆうわけ、
潮流にもまれて長い航海の禁慾生活は十日二十日と経つに従つて、マドロスの氣がすさみ、航海日数が嵩めば嵩むだけ喧嘩や争論が多くなるとゆう。港の乙女達の總勢は二百人。荒くれたマドロス相手だから、さぞかし、おかめ面の古女房かと思えば逢つてみておどろく。何れも十八九から二十四五止まり、相當に踏めるのが多い。
板一枚下は海底だとゆうマドロスは明日の命がわからない。船が港に入ると、なけなしの財布の底をはたいて一夜の女に入れあける、陸の贅六共の知らない遊蕩ぶりだ。
何もにしろ歸りの電車賃がいるでなし、飯は日に三回宛船で食わせてくれる。僅かの金の残りより彼女に財布ぐるみ與えて、その純情に浸るのである。
だから同じ娼婦づめでも、海上の稼ぎは、陸かせぎに比べてずつと樂で身入りがいいとゆう。
四國から中國へ、中國から九州各地への貨物船の集散地として立つこの港町は、モダンなセイラーと帆船の若い船頭さんの落す金が主として町の賑わいの元である。
つまり、町の特殊な發展のためにこの海上ローマンス、おしかけ娼婦の營業が、その決死的サービスが、煽情的なアッピールが必要だつた。
船が港に入ると、大擧して性取引に出掛ける。何にしろこれでハサミ取る金額が町の經費の大半を負擔しているのであるから、秘事は一切街から見えぬ沖合の船室で便じ、すべて海上に流して上陸するため、陸での娼妓より弊害は少いと言われる。
かくて海港、エロの街は、入港する貨物船に明け、貨物船に暮れる。

**Girls of the Ports: Brothels of the Inland Sea**
**By Nakahara Harumi**

When spreading out a map of the Seto Inland Sea, numerous ancient battlefields like Yashima, Dannoura, and Ichinotani unfold the history of old before one's eyes. However, those are names of places, coasts, and islands that serve as means to remember the past. The Inland Sea, now as in the past, has not changed in supporting the coastal villages as a fishing ground. Along with that, in the era when palanquins, horses, and walking were the representative means of transport on land, a sea voyage of 100 or 200 *koku* [capacity] was the only high-speed, large-volume transport mechanism. Consequently, for the transport of goods from Sakai to Bakan, or from Chūgoku to Shikoku, the sea life of these sailors continued for ten days or a month away from home.

In both the past and present, the things that console the loneliness of a traveler's window are sake and women. Furthermore, those living at sea, where "one plank below is hell," seek longing in the girls of various ports; because of this, they could endure the fierce storms of February and August, and the painful sea route could instantly become a dream-like feeling—the maidens of the port! Whether it be the international city of Shanghai, Marseille, Venice, Yokohama, or Hakata of the Tokugawa era, or Sakai-ura, first of all, luxurious brothels lined up along the coast could be seen. It is no exaggeration to say that the development of merchant houses parasitic to them created the current seaport cities.

In the era when peace was sung politically and economically during the Tokugawa era, the lives of these courtesans were also extremely peaceful itself, like a dream. Since the Meiji era, a harsh life has crowded in, and courtesans have completely fallen into being sexual traders and providers of flesh as a mechanical service; however, if one traces before that, it was a dream-like romance market where, during a traveler's stay, they would act like a wife, doing the husband's laundry and becoming a consultation partner—serving as a true consoler, an "extra wife."

In today's social conditions of robbery and murder, such comfort stations and soul-melting romance markets are necessary, but though there are sex trade markets that are like children of money, crying "money, money, money," the carefree world of courtesans of old is a dream story. However, near a large station on the Sanyō Line, there is a port town just like the old days, a "port of women," which I want to introduce. It is in Hiroshima Prefecture, facing the Seto Inland Sea, the shortest distance connecting Chūgoku and Shikoku.

*Bo-bo* goes the cargo ship, sounding its whistle from offshore. On land, it is a commotion like a battlefield; onto each *temmabune* (shuttle boat), an "army of girls" with perms leaps, and with vigor toward the offshore ship, they "attack" with the boatmen's powerful rowing, shouting "yoisho, yoisho." According to the order of arrival, they rush from the captain to the purser, chief engineer, driver—from high-ranking officers to the rooms of the oiling sailors.

The only "maritime erotica" in Japan; hungry "madros" (sailors) each establish a sexual contract and spend half a day or a day in the caresses of "land mermaids" to do the "laundry of life." Finally, with a delay, *sampans* packed with stevedores arrive. The winches operate and cargo handling begins. Soon, some come out of the temporary rooms one by one to do laundry, while others are seen tossing their hair in the morning breeze on the deck.

The life of abstinence during long voyages tossed by tides—as ten or twenty days pass, the sailors' spirits grow desolate, and it is said that as sailing days pile up, quarrels and arguments increase. The total number of port maidens is two hundred. Since they deal with rough sailors, one might think they are "Okame-faced" (plain) old hags, but meeting them brings surprise. All are from eighteen or nineteen to twenty-four or twenty-five at most, and many are quite "steppable" (attractive/talented).

The sailors, who say "one plank below is the seabed," do not know if they will live tomorrow. When the ship enters port, they empty their meager wallets for a woman of one night—a level of profligacy unknown to the "zeiroku" (land-lubbers). After all, there's no need for return train fare, and they are fed on the ship three times a day. Rather than a tiny bit of remaining money, they give her the whole wallet and immerse themselves in her purity.

Therefore, even among the same brothel work, earning at sea is said to be much easier and better-paying than earning on land. This port town, standing as a distribution center for cargo ships from Shikoku to Chūgoku and from Chūgoku to various places in Kyūshū, has the money dropped by modern "sailors" and young boatmen of sailing ships as the main source of the town's prosperity.

In other words, for the special development of the town, this "maritime romance," the business of "intruding prostitutes," and their "do-or-die service" required a sensational appeal. When ships enter port, they go out for sex trade in large numbers. At any rate, since the amount "snipped off" here bears most of the town's expenses, the secret matters are transacted in offshore cabins invisible from the town, and since everything is washed away into the sea before landing, it is said there is less harm than from brothels on land. Thus, the seaport, the town of erotica, dawns with incoming cargo ships and sets with cargo ships.

**The Maidens of the Ports: Brothels of the Inland Sea**
**By Harumi Nakahara**

Gazing at a map of the Seto Inland Sea, the names of ancient battlefields—Yashima, Dannoura, Ichinotani—bring the ghosts of history vividly to life. Yet today, these are merely names, coastlines, and islands that serve as markers for nostalgia. The Inland Sea itself remains unchanged, its fishing grounds supporting the coastal villages now just as they did in centuries past. 

In the days when travel on land meant palanquins, horses, or one's own feet, a voyage on a cargo boat of 100 or 200 *koku* was the only "high-speed" method for bulk transport. Consequently, sailors hauling goods between Sakai and Bakan, or Chūgoku and Shikoku, spent weeks or even months away from home, living entirely upon the waves.

Then, as now, the only solaces for the weary traveler are sake and women. For those living the perilous life of a mariner—where, as the saying goes, "hell is but the thickness of a single plank away"—the girls of the port were a beacon of longing. It was their presence that allowed sailors to endure the ferocious gales of February and August; the "Maidens of the Port" could transform a grueling voyage into a dreamlike reverie in an instant.

Whether in international hubs like Shanghai, Marseille, and Venice, or in the Japanese ports of Yokohama, Tokugawa-era Hakata, or Sakai, the first thing one would see along the coast were the magnificent brothels. It is no exaggeration to say that the development of the merchant houses that fed off these establishments laid the foundations for today’s great port cities.

During the political and economic peace of the Tokugawa era, the lives of these courtesans were themselves serene, almost dreamlike. Since the Meiji era, however, the harsh realities of modern life have encroached. Prostitutes have been reduced to mere "sex traders," providers of flesh delivering a mechanical service. Yet, looking back further, one finds a "romance market" of a more lyrical sort. During a traveler’s stay, the girl would act as a surrogate wife—doing his laundry, listening to his troubles, and serving as a true source of comfort—an "extra wife," so to speak.

In today's bleak landscape of robbery and murder, perhaps such "comfort stations" and soul-soothing romance markets are still necessary. But today’s sex trade is a creature of "money, money, money," and the leisurely, old-world atmosphere of the courtesan has become little more than a fairy tale.

However, near a major station on the Sanyō Line, there remains a port town that still feels like the "port of women" of old. Situated in Hiroshima Prefecture, it sits at the shortest crossing point between Chūgoku and Shikoku.

The low drone of a cargo ship’s whistle echoes from offshore. On land, a frenzy erupts, reminiscent of a battlefield. An "army" of girls with permed hair leaps into shuttle boats, and with spirited shouts of "Yoisho! Yoisho!", they "attack" the incoming vessel as the boatmen row with all their might. They swarm aboard in order of arrival, rushing past the captain, the purser, and the engineers, all the way down to the cramped quarters of the oilers.

In this unique hub of "maritime erotica," the sex-starved "madros" (sailors) strike their bargains. They spend half a day or a full day in the embrace of these "land mermaids," washing away the grime of their existence. Eventually, *sampans* loaded with stevedores arrive, the winches begin to groan, and the work of unloading starts. Soon, you might see the girls emerging from the temporary cabins to do laundry, or standing on the deck, running their fingers through their hair in the morning breeze.

After ten or twenty days of forced celibacy on the tides, a sailor's spirit begins to rot; the longer the voyage, the more frequent the brawls. There are about two hundred of these port maidens in total. One might expect them to be plain-faced old hags to match the rough sailors they serve, but the reality is surprising. Most are between eighteen and twenty-five, and many are quite striking.

For a sailor who lives with "only a plank between him and the seabed," there is no guarantee of tomorrow. When they hit port, they blow their entire meager savings on a woman for a single night—a level of abandon unknown to the "land-lubbers." They don't need train fare home, and they get three square meals on the ship. Rather than clutch a few remaining coins, they often give their entire wallet to the girl, losing themselves in her perceived "purity."

Thus, despite being the same line of work, earning a living on the water is said to be far easier and more lucrative than working the streets on land. This port town, a vital hub for cargo moving between Shikoku, Chūgoku, and Kyūshū, thrives primarily on the money spent by both modern sailors and the young crews of traditional sailing vessels.

The town’s unique development has relied on this "maritime romance"—this industry of "ambush prostitutes" and their desperate, sensational appeal. When a ship docks, they go out in force. Since the money "snipped" from these encounters pays for most of the town's expenses, the authorities look the other way. Because the "secret business" takes place in offshore cabins and is "washed away" by the sea before anyone sets foot on land, it is often said to be less socially damaging than land-based prostitution. And so, the port—this city of erotica—wakes and sleeps to the rhythm of the cargo ships.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Structure:** The text is presented in a traditional Japanese vertical layout (*tate-gaki*), spanning four columns. This format is typical for mid-20th-century magazine features or literary essays.
*   **Typography:** The typeface is a classic Mincho serif style. The title is significantly larger and bolder, using a brush-stroke style for "港々の乙女" (Girls of the Ports). Sub-headings or related titles like "内海の娼樓" (Brothels of the Inland Sea) are slightly smaller.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The author's name, 中原春美 (Nakahara Harumi), is placed prominently below the title. The use of whitespace between columns and the justified text alignment suggests a professional publication.
*   **Formatting Elements:**
    *   **Kanakai (Kana usage):** The text uses modern *shin-kanazukai* (e.g., とゆう instead of といふ), but retains some older kanji forms (*kyūjitai*) like 樓 (tower/brothel), 變 (change), 關 (gate/connection), and 國 (country).
    *   **Emphasis:** Specific terms like セイラー (Sailor) and アッピール (Appeal) use katakana for emphasis and to denote modern/Western concepts.
    *   **Punctuation:** Commas and periods are used traditionally. Quotation marks (「 」) are used for idioms and direct quotes.
*   **Pagination:** A small page number "- 34 -" is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger magazine or anthology.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII, approx. late 1940s-1950s):** The mix of historical references (Tokugawa/Meiji) with modern terms like "Permanent" (perm), "Sailor" (in katakana), and "Cargo ships" suggests the early post-war period. Prostitution was legal (or tolerated in specific zones) in Japan until the Prostitution Prevention Law of 1956.
*   **The Seto Inland Sea:** Historically, this was the most important maritime corridor in Japan. The mention of Yashima and Dannoura refers to the Genpei War (12th century), romanticizing the sea's history before transitioning to the gritty reality of the sex trade.
*   **Port Town Culture:** Port towns (*minato-machi*) were historically "border zones" where social norms were looser. The "extra wife" (*ekisutora nyōbō*) concept refers to the *meshimori-onna* or *shukuba-jorō* of the Edo period, who provided domestic services alongside sex.
*   **Sailor Slang:** The term "Madros" (マドロス) comes from the Dutch *matroos* (via Portuguese), common in Japanese maritime culture to describe a salty, romanticized sailor. "Zeiroku" (贅六) is an old derogatory term used by sailors or Kyoto/Osaka people to describe people from Edo (Tokyo) or, more generally, dull land-dwellers.
*   **"Itako Ippai Shita wa Jigoku":** A famous Japanese maritime proverb ("One plank below is hell"), emphasizing the constant proximity to death for those at sea.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **娼樓 (Shōrō):** A brothel. The use of the character 樓 (tower/building) gives it a slightly more literary or historical weight than modern terms.
*   **乙女 (Otome):** Maiden or young girl. Using this term for prostitutes creates a contrast between their perceived innocence/youth and their profession.
*   **マドロス (Madorosu):** Sailor. Evokes a sense of 1950s maritime romanticism.
*   **伝馬船 (Temmabune):** A small traditional boat used for shuttling people and goods between the shore and larger ships.
*   **娘子軍 (Jōshigun):** Literally "army of women/girls." Here used metaphorically to describe the group of women swarming the ships.
*   **沖仲仕 (Okinakashi):** Stevedores or longshoremen who load/unload ships.
*   **ハサミ取る (Hasami-toru):** Literally "to snip off." Used as slang for taking a cut of money or overcharging.
*   **エキストラ女房 (Ekisutora Nyōbō):** "Extra wife." A euphemism for a temporary, domestic-acting prostitute.
*   **命の洗濯 (Inochi no Sentaku):** "Washing of life." A common idiom meaning to relax, refresh oneself, or have a "blowout" to relieve stress.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Dehumanization of Modernity:** The author laments how the "dream-like" and "peaceful" romance of the Edo period has turned into a "mechanical service" in the modern era. This reflects a common post-war intellectual anxiety about the loss of "traditional Japanese spirit" to Westernized capitalism.
*   **Economic Symbiosis:** A major subtext is the economic dependence of the town on the sex trade. The author explicitly states that these women's earnings cover most of the town's expenses, framing the "maritime romance" as a necessary fiscal engine.
*   **Isolation and Human Connection:** The sailors are depicted as "starved"—not just for sex, but for human warmth and domesticity (symbolized by the women doing their laundry).
*   **Liminality:** The "offshore" space (the ships) is treated as a lawless or "safe" zone where moral transgressions can be washed away by the sea, making it "less harmful" than land-based vice. This highlights the ship as a *heterotopia*—a space outside normal social rules.
*   **Masculinity and Risk:** The sailor's life is defined by the constant threat of death ("one plank away"). Their reckless spending is framed as a natural response to their high-risk environment.
