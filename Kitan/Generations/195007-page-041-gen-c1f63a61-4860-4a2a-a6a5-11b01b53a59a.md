享樂の蔭に咲く
劇藥 三題話
須山　透

一、ヒロポンのヤミ値百七十圓

**[Main Body Text]**
世紀末的な頹廢氣分の横溢している現代、刺戟の強烈さを求めてやまない病的な人々にとって、落ち着く先が恐ろしい麻藥であることは申すまでもなからう。
ところが、アヘン、モルヒネ、コカイン、ナルコポンなどは、取しまりが嚴重な上に、値段もべらぼうに高く、普通の人にはなかなか入手が困難である。その代りに……といふわけであらうか、麻藥代りにさかんに使はれるのが、ヒロポン、アドレム、それに最近ふたゝび芽を吹き出したヨヒンビンである。
第一のヒロポンの方は、商賣柄女士や藝能人、さてはスリ、チヤリンコなどに愛用され、ヒロポン欲しさに強盗や窃盗をやる犯罪者が激増し、さらに濫用する結果、慢性中毒の精神病人が氾濫したため、大きな社會問題となり、たまりかねた厚生省では今年一月、呼法令でヒロポンの製造および販賣を禁止してしまった。

ところが、醫師の證明書があれば、期間四十日間として、一日三本を限度にして藥局から買うことができる抜け道もあり、よんぱ證明書がなくても、顔なじみの薬局にたのめば金次弟で魚心に水心別に不自由することはないのが實情である。
そのために、ヒロポンのヤミ値はいま物凄く暴騰して、丸公の八十一圓の約二倍百七十圓ぐらいが相場になっており、それでもわれ先へのうばいあいである。
ヒロポンの効果のすばらしさは知る人ぞ知るだが、一本注射すれば五分たたぬうちに心ウキウキと浮きたち、頭は冴え、身体中に元気が充ちてくる。矢でも鐵砲でも持つてこいと傲然ハッキリ、文士ならペンがすみ、藝能人ならステージに立って、どつと観衆の拍手を浴びる。
ところが、これも薬の作用が効いている二三時間の間だけで、さめてしまえば元のモクアミどころか、心身にむりをした疲労がどつと出て来て、霊廟でもトロトロとわれ知らず、ぶったおれて眠りこんでしまう。だから又注射して元気をとりもどす。これを何べんもくり返すから、しまいには一、時間おきに立てつづけに注射しなければ効かないさになってしまうものだ。
男だけでなく女にもヒロポン中毒はずいぶん多い。ストリツプショウの踊り子、キャバレーの女給、ホールのダンサーさてはパンパン連中は特にヒロポンを愛用する。あるパンパンの告白によると、一夜にヒロポンを五本打てば十人の客を満足させて平気だといっていたぐらいである。
ヒロポン（同種品＝ゼトリン、ホスビタミン、ネオアゴチン）の正体はなんであろうか。これは化合名をエチルプロパミンといって発見されたのはいまから四十年も...

Blooming in the shadows of pleasure
Strong drugs: Three stories
Suyama Tōru

1. Hiropon's black market price: 170 Yen

**[Main Body Text]**
In the present day where an end-of-the-century decadent mood is overflowing, for sickly people who do not stop seeking intense stimulation, it goes without saying that the place they settle is terrifying narcotics.
However, opium, morphine, cocaine, narcopon and so on, on top of strict enforcement, prices are also absurdly high, and for ordinary people, obtaining them is quite difficult. Instead of that... is that why? What are actively used instead of narcotics are Hiropon, Adrem, and Yohimbine which recently sprouted again.
Regarding the first one, Hiropon, because of their profession, "hostess ladies" and entertainers, as well as pickpockets and "charinko" (petty thieves) etc. use it habitually; criminals who do robberies and thefts wanting Hiropon have increased sharply, and furthermore as a result of abuse, because chronic-addicted mental patients overflowed and it became a big social problem, the Ministry of Health, unable to bear it, in January this year, by decree prohibited the manufacture and sale of Hiropon.

However, if there is a doctor's certificate, there is a loophole where one can buy from a pharmacy with a limit of three vials a day for a 40-day period, or even if there is no certificate, if one asks a familiar pharmacy, depending on money, "fish heart to water heart" (reciprocity), the reality is there is no particular inconvenience.
Because of that, Hiropon's black market price is now incredibly soaring, about 170 Yen which is double the official price of 81 Yen is the market rate, and even so, it is a scramble of "me first."
The greatness of Hiropon's effect is known to those who know, but if one injects one vial, before five minutes pass, the heart becomes cheerful and buoyant, the head clears, and energy fills the whole body. "Bring on arrows or guns" (I'm invincible), proudly and clearly, if it's a writer the pen moves, if it's an entertainer they stand on stage and receive a burst of applause from the audience.
However, this too is only for the two or three hours while the drug's action is effective; when it wears off, far from being "original state," the fatigue from overtaxing the mind and body comes out all at once, and like a tomb (sluggishly) without knowing it, one collapses and falls into a deep sleep. Therefore, one injects again to regain energy. Because one repeats this many times, eventually it becomes a thing where it won't work unless one injects continuously every hour.
Not only men but among women Hiropon addiction is quite common. Strip show dancers, cabaret waitresses, hall dancers, and further the "pan-pan" (prostitutes) groups especially use Hiropon habitually. According to the confession of a certain pan-pan, she said that if she shots five Hiropon in one night, she could satisfy ten customers and be fine.
What is the true identity of Hiropon (similar products = Zedrin, Hospitamin, Neo-Agotin)? This chemical name is called Ethylpropamine and it was discovered forty years ago...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Blooming in the Shadows of Pleasure: Three Tales of Lethal Drugs**
By Tōru Suyama

**1. The 170-Yen Black Market Price of Hiropon**

In our modern age, awash in a decadent, fin-de-siècle atmosphere, it goes without saying that those pathologically driven to seek ever-more intense stimulation eventually find themselves in the terrifying grip of narcotics. 
However, drugs like opium, morphine, cocaine, and Narcopon are not only under strict government control but are prohibitively expensive, making them nearly impossible for the average person to obtain. Perhaps that is why Hiropon, Adrem, and the recently resurgent Yohimbine have become such popular substitutes.

Hiropon, in particular, has become a staple for certain professions—hostesses, entertainers, and even pickpockets or petty thieves. The number of criminals committing robberies and thefts just to get their hands on the drug has surged. Furthermore, the resulting flood of chronically addicted individuals suffering from mental illness became such a massive social crisis that the Ministry of Health finally prohibited its manufacture and sale by decree in January of this year.

Yet, loopholes remain. With a doctor’s certificate, one can still legally purchase up to three vials a day for a forty-day period. And even without a certificate, the reality is that if you have a rapport with a local pharmacist and enough cash, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours," and obtaining it is no trouble at all. 
Consequently, the black market price of Hiropon has skyrocketed. The current rate is about 170 yen—roughly double the official price of 81 yen—and even at that cost, people are fighting over every vial.

Those who have tried Hiropon know its incredible effects. Within five minutes of a single injection, your spirits soar, your mind becomes razor-sharp, and your body surges with vitality. You feel invincible, as if you could take on arrows or bullets. A writer’s pen flies across the page; an entertainer takes the stage to thunderous applause. 
But the high lasts only two or three hours. Once it wears off, you don't just return to normal—the accumulated exhaustion of pushing your body to its limit hits you all at once. You collapse into a stupor, falling into a dead sleep before you even realize it. To get that energy back, you inject again. This cycle repeats until eventually, you find yourself needing a shot every single hour just to function.

Addiction is rampant among women as well as men. Strippers, cabaret girls, ballroom dancers, and especially the "pan-pan" streetwalkers are frequent users. One such girl even claimed that with five shots of Hiropon, she could service ten clients in a single night without breaking a sweat.
So, what exactly is Hiropon (and its counterparts like Zedrin, Hospitamin, and Neo-Agotin)? Chemically known as "Ethylpropamine," it was discovered forty years ago...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Format and Layout
The page is a classic example of a "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine layout from the late 1940s to early 1950s. It features a mixture of sensationalist reporting and comic relief.

*   **Header:** The main title is prominent, using a stylized font that suggests "pleasure" and "danger."
*   **Column Structure:** The main article is written in traditional vertical Japanese (*tategaki*), divided into columns. 
*   **Illustrations:** 
    *   **Top Illustration:** A satirical cartoon of a "Marriage Consultation Office" that is actually a front for "One-Night Wives" (prostitution). The characters are drawn in a Western-influenced caricature style common in post-war Japan.
    *   **"Conto" (Skit):** A smaller comic strip at the bottom of the first column features a woman in a bikini, likely a stripper or cabaret girl, reflecting the "erotic-grotesque-nonsense" (ero-guro-nansensu) aesthetic of the era.
*   **Typography:** Uses *Kyūjitai* (traditional kanji) and *Rekishiteki Kanazukai* (historical kana usage), which was standard until the post-war reforms were fully adopted in the 1950s.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Hiropon (ヒロポン):** This was the brand name for methamphetamine (meth). During WWII, it was distributed to soldiers and factory workers to keep them awake and productive. Post-war, surplus stocks flooded the market, leading to a massive addiction crisis. The 1951 ban mentioned in the text refers to the "Stimulants Control Act."
*   **Pan-pan (パンパン):** A slang term for street prostitutes who catered primarily to American GIs during the Occupation. They were often associated with the drug culture of the time.
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** These were cheap, tawdry magazines published on low-quality paper (called "Kasutori" after a cheap dregs-based shochu). They focused on sex, crime, and sensationalist news, thriving in the lawless atmosphere of early post-war Japan.
*   **Prices:** The mention of 170 Yen for a vial of Hiropon provides a window into the hyperinflation of the era. For context, a cup of coffee at the time might have been 10-20 Yen.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Gekiyaku (劇薬):** Powerful or lethal drugs. In a medical context, it refers to drugs with high toxicity.
*   **Yami-ne (ヤミ値):** Black market price. In post-war Japan, rationing made the "yami-ichi" (black market) the only place to get many goods.
*   **Uonokoro ni mizu-gokoro (魚心に水心):** A proverb literally meaning "if the fish has a heart for the water, the water has a heart for the fish." It translates to "If you do me a favor, I'll do you one," or "mutual sympathy/reciprocity."
*   **Mokuami (木阿弥):** Refers to the proverb "Moto no Mokuami," meaning "returning to the original state" (often after a temporary improvement that turned out to be an illusion).
*   **Charinko (チャリンコ):** In this era, it specifically referred to juvenile pickpockets or petty thieves (not the modern usage for "bicycle").

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Decadence vs. Survival:** The text highlights a "fin-de-siècle" mood, suggesting that the trauma of losing the war and the collapse of old values led people to seek chemical escape.
*   **The Myth of Productivity:** The article notes that writers and entertainers use the drug to perform better, echoing the wartime use of meth for labor efficiency, but then warns of the inevitable physical collapse.
*   **Sensationalism:** The author uses vivid, almost breathless language ("Bring on arrows or guns!") to describe the drug's effects, while simultaneously condemning it—a common tactic in pulp journalism to attract readers while maintaining a veneer of morality.
*   **Gender and Class:** By specifically mentioning "pan-pan" girls and cabaret dancers, the text links drug use to the "lower" classes and the burgeoning sex industry of the Occupation period.
