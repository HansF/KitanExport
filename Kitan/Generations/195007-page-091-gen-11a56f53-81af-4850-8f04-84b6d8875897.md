「ね、三度目だ。さあ、これで別れよう。」
私はそういつてすべつこいアゴをあげ、彼女の唇を離した。
澄んだ眼の色、ぼうつと頬をあからめて、まるい頬を、火のようにほてらしていることも、月のないガード下の真ッ暗がりの中ではあったが、私にはよくわかつた。まだ十代の新鮮な感触得難い賢玉のような貴ささえ感じて、私の腕に力がこもつた。サッと通り魔のように周囲に人の気配を感じたか、その時、音のかたまりを叩きつけるように、頭上を省線電車が走り過ぎ星の光が、何かに反射して彼女の濡れた唇がチカリと光つた。

彼女は、胸から上をそらすようにして、首をまげ、人の気配に、警戒の眼をくばつた。
私も、そのままの姿勢でヤミをすかすようにしてガード下から北へのびる街路の方をながめて息を殺した。人が立っている。たしかに数人のものが、私たちをとりまくように監視している。彼女はギョッとしたのか、ケイレン…

**1. The Pimp’s Daughter’s Innocence**

"Hey, it's the third time. Now, let’s part with this."
I said so, raised her smooth chin, and released her lips.
The color of her clear eyes, faintly reddening her cheeks, and that her round cheeks were burning like fire—even though it was in the total darkness under the railway bridge on a moonless night, it was well understood by me. Feeling a freshness of the teens, a preciousness like an unobtainable jewel, strength entered my arms. Suddenly, as if sensing a presence of people around like a passing demon, at that moment, as if striking a mass of sound, a Ministry of Railways train ran past overhead, and starlight reflected off something, and her wet lips flashed.

She, as if arching from the chest up, bent her neck and cast wary eyes toward the presence of people.
I also, in that same posture, as if peering through the darkness, looked toward the street stretching north from under the bridge and held my breath. People are standing. Certainly several people are monitoring us as if surrounding us. She, perhaps startled, convulsed...

**Loincloths and Breeches**
**(Four Scenes)**

**Scene 1**

Part of an apartment rooftop laundry area; Fujiwara’s drying area and Kawamura’s drying area.
In Fujiwara’s area, a *koshimaki* (loincloth) and *sarumata* (breeches) are drying. Side by side, in Kawamura’s area, a *koshimaki* and a shirt are drying.
[X]
The spring sky is hazily misted, a west wind blows strongly, and the laundry is fluttering "hira-hira."
............ (Pause) ............
[Fujiwara’s wife, Ayako (a voluptuous woman, wearing pure white makeup and a 'kantan-fuku' simple dress) comes up to the rooftop.]
Ayako: (Looking up at the sky) What a strong wind. (Casting eyes on the laundry) Oh, the laundry of the Kawamura house... the wife Matsuko’s red *koshimaki* has slipped because of the wind and is layered over Fujiwara’s laundry, fluttering "hata-hata."
Ayako: Goodness, how filthy. She’s making a fool of me, the lady next door. To dry her own *koshimaki* right next to my husband’s things.
(Tilting her head slightly) Lately, she stays in makeup ridiculously long, and besides, the other day she said, "Your husband is so kind," giving such flatteries... and even Fujiwara...

**The Succubi of Umeda**
*Violence and Obsession, Part II*
By Ushio Kuroe
Illustrated by Reiko Nanase

**1. The Pimp’s Daughter’s Innocence**

"Listen, that’s the third time. Let's call it a night."
I spoke as I tilted her smooth chin up and broke our kiss. Despite the pitch-black darkness beneath the moonless railway overpass, I could tell her clear eyes were wide and her round cheeks were flushed crimson, burning like fire. I felt a preciousness in her—that rare, fresh touch only a girl in her teens possesses, like a priceless jewel—and I pulled her closer into my arms. Just as I sensed a sudden, ominous presence around us, a train roared across the tracks overhead, a crushing weight of sound. In that split second, a glint of starlight caught the moisture on her lips, making them shimmer.

She arched her back and turned her head, her eyes sharp and wary of the unseen figures. I froze in place, peering through the gloom toward the street that stretched north from the overpass, holding my breath. People were standing there. Several figures had moved in, surrounding us, watching. She gave a start, her body convulsing...

**The Loincloth and the Breeches**
*(A Play in Four Scenes)*

**Scene One**

The rooftop laundry deck of an apartment building, divided between the Fujiwara and Kawamura households. On the Fujiwara side, a woman’s *koshimaki* loincloth and a man’s *sarumata* breeches hang to dry. Right next to them, on the Kawamura side, hang another *koshimaki* and a shirt.
[X]
The spring sky is a hazy blur. A stiff western breeze blows, sending the laundry flapping and dancing in the wind.
(A long pause)
[Ayako Fujiwara enters. She is a voluptuous woman, heavily made up in white powder and wearing a simple house dress.]
Ayako: (Looking up) My, the wind is strong today! (Noticing the laundry) Oh, look at that. Mrs. Kawamura’s red loincloth has slipped in the wind and is practically on top of my husband’s laundry, flapping right against it!
Ayako: How disgusting. She must be doing this to spite me. To hang her own intimate wear right next to my husband's things... (She tilts her head suspiciously) She’s been spending an awfully long time on her makeup lately. And just the other day, she was all smiles, telling me how "kind" my husband is. Even Fujiwara, he's been acting...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into two distinct sections. The top half is a narrative "Kasutori" short story accompanied by a large, dramatic illustration. The bottom half is a script for a stage play or "skit."
*   **Typography:** 
    *   The main title ("Umeda no Jokei-tachi") uses a heavy, stylized brush font typical of pulp magazines to evoke mystery and danger.
    *   Furigana (phonetic readings) are provided for difficult kanji like "女怪" (Jokei) and "情痴" (Jōchi), indicating a general readership level.
    *   The use of bold headers for sub-sections creates a clear hierarchy.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration is the focal point. It depicts a man in a Fedora (suggestive of a "noir" protagonist or a black-market dealer) and several women with Westernized hairstyles and bold expressions, reflecting the "Modern Girl" influence persisting in the post-war era.
*   **Formatting:** The play script uses standard theatrical formatting: bracketed stage directions, character names followed by dialogue, and "X" or dots to indicate scene breaks or pauses.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text is a prime example of *Kasutori* literature, named after a cheap, foul-smelling rice wine. These magazines flourished during the "Pan-pan" (streetwalker) era of the Occupation (1945–1952), focusing on the "3S": Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports.
*   **Umeda:** The Umeda district in Osaka was a major transportation hub that became a center for black markets (*yamichi*) and red-light districts after the war. The "Female Monsters" (Succubi) refers to the predatory or alluring women of these districts.
*   **The "Guard" (ガード下):** Refers to the space under elevated railway tracks. In post-war Japan, these were often hubs for illicit activities, temporary housing, and secret romantic encounters.
*   **Sarumata and Koshimaki:** Traditional Japanese underwear. A *koshimaki* is a wrap-around loincloth for women; *sarumata* are traditional men's underpants. The play's focus on laundry (undergarments) touching suggests themes of neighborhood adultery or sexual tension.
*   **Kantan-fuku (簡単服):** "Simple clothing," a type of easy-to-sew, Western-style house dress that became popular for Japanese women during and immediately after the war due to fabric shortages.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **女怪 (Jokei):** Literally "female ghost/monster," but used here as a trope for a "femme fatale" or a dangerous, seductive woman.
*   **ポン引 (Ponbiki):** A pimp or a shill who lures customers into illegal gambling or prostitution.
*   **情痴 (Jōchi):** Sexual infatuation or being blinded by lust.
*   **省線電車 (Shōsen Densha):** "Ministry Railways Train." This term identifies the era as being before 1949, when the Ministry of Railways became the Japanese National Railways (JNR).
*   **ヤミ (Yami):** Short for *Yamichi* (Black Market). Here used to describe the "darkness" of the underworld or the physical darkness of the area.
*   **肉感的 (Nikukanteki):** Voluptuous, sensual, or "fleshy." A common adjective in Kasutori literature.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and Surveillance:** In the first story, the romantic moment is interrupted by a feeling of being watched by "several people." This reflects the paranoid, crowded atmosphere of post-war slums where privacy was non-existent.
*   **Moral Decay vs. Innocence:** The title "The Pimp's Daughter's Innocence" creates a paradox, contrasting the grittiness of her background with the narrator’s perception of her "purity."
*   **Jealousy and Domestic Tension:** The play script uses the metaphor of laundry (intimate garments) "touching" to signify a breach of social and marital boundaries. The red *koshimaki* (associated with sexuality) touching the neighbor's clothes is interpreted as a sexual provocation.
*   **Westernization:** The character "Ayako" wearing makeup and Western-style clothing highlights the shift in female identity during the Occupation.
