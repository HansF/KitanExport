## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

ひっそりとして人の氣配もない。親爺の家は店から二三丁離れた先である。途中に建築中の大方出来上りかけた家がある。
「安さん、こゝで一休みしよう。」と親爺が言えば、安さんは恐れげもなく、この無人の空家へのとゝついて入った。四十過ぎの脂ぎった親爺が、娘の様な若い女に抱きついて、
「安さん、いやろう。八重ちゃんとも前に旅館へ泊つた事あるから、君かてかめへんやろ、」
とやにつくど囁く、酔いが廻つて足のたゝない安さんは、空家の床に、着物の裾を乱して大あぐらをかいて座りこみ、
「親爺、あんまり変な事言わんといてや、人はどうでもこの安さんは、見損なわんといてや、おかしな真似しやがって見、近所中聞える位大きな聲出したるから、――ウワアー」
とジャングルでホウコウするライオンの様な聲を上げられて、もう我が家も近くこの辺には顔見知りも多いから、人に見られたら恥さらしと、親爺は驚いて、
「安さんそんな大きな聲出さんでもええやんか、もう分つた、なあそない怒らんといて、わいが店まで、負うて帰つたるから、」
と安さんをなだめすかして氣嫌をとり、彼女を背負つて店へ引き返した。失敗した熱情の吐け口に困り乍ら、せめて背中に傳わる女の肌のぬくみを味わうだけの楽しみで我慢して、恙なく店へ送り届けてしまった。

なんとかして女給をものにしようと下心を持って通う男達は、ものにしてしまえば口も軽く、手柄のように直ぐそれを人に洩らすものだが、こんな男達もまだ安さんをどうしたといわない處をみれば、案外その一点だけは堅いらしかつた。妙な女であ。男を最後まで引きつけて、つき放すのが道樂である。さもしい男は安さんのよいおもちゃにされている。
店のマダムに好い旦那というより、若いりばめという方が適切であり、六つ年下で、相当金廻りはよいらしく、いつもちゃんとした服装をしているが、マダムの為に必要以上の金は絶対に使わない、大柄で色白の口のうまい男がある。
時によれば毎日のように消えて行く。マダムにほれているというより、女のどろゝしている家のフンイキに鼻の下をのばしているようで、若い女のあけくれのあらゆる肢体を楽しんでいるらしかつた。この男が居る時、マダムの親戚の人が三人遊びに来て泊っていった。親戚傍で、大びら亭主扱いして添寝するのも氣が悪く、客のようにあしらつたが、男は帰ろうともせず、マダムは親戚の人達と寝み、男は狭い家で外に寝る處がないのを幸いに安さんの傍らにもぐりこみ、雑魚寝した。
助平男が、安さんの体にふれるのであろう。安さんは大げさにキャア～騒ぐ、襖一つむこうのマダムは気がいら～して寝られなかった。翌日親戚の人を送り出した後で、寝不足のとが

ひっそりとして人の気配もない。親父の家は店から二、三丁離れた先である。途中に建築中の大方出来上がりかけた家がある。
「安さん、ここで一休みしよう」と親父が言えば、安さんは恐れる様子もなく、この無人の空き家へとついて入った。四十過ぎの脂ぎった親父が、娘のような若い女に抱きついて、
「安さん、いいだろう。八重ちゃんとも前に旅館へ泊まったことがあるから、君だって構わないだろう」
と、にやついた顔でささやく。酔いが回って足の立たない安さんは、空き家の床に、着物の裾を乱してあぐらをかいて座り込み、
「親父、あんまり変なこと言わないでよ。他の人はどうあれ、この安さんのことは見くびらないで。おかしな真似をしてみなさい、近所中に聞こえるくらい大きな声を出してやるから。――ウワー！」
と、ジャングルで咆哮するライオンのような声を上げられて、もう我が家も近く、この辺りには顔見知りも多いから、人に見られたら恥さらしだと、親父は驚いて、
「安さん、そんな大きな声を出さなくてもいいじゃないか。もう分かった、なあ、そんなに怒らないで。わしが店までおんぶして帰ってやるから」
と安さんをなだめすかして機嫌を取り、彼女を背負って店へ引き返した。失敗した熱情の吐け口に困りながら、せめて背中に伝わる女の肌のぬくみを味わうだけの楽しみで我慢して、無事に店へ送り届けてしまった。

何とかして女給（じょきゅう）をものにしようと下心を持って通う男たちは、ものにしてしまえば口も軽く、手柄のようにすぐそれを人に漏らすものだが、こんな男たちもまだ安さんを「どうにかした」と言わないところを見れば、案外その一点だけは堅いらしかった。妙な女である。男を最後まで惹きつけて、突き放すのが道楽なのだ。卑しい男たちは安さんの良いおもちゃにされている。
店のマダムには「良い旦那」というより「若いツバメ（年下の愛人）」という方が適切であり、六つ年下で、相当金回りは良いらしく、いつもちゃんとした服装をしているが、マダムのために必要以上のお金は絶対に使わない、大柄で色白の、口のうまい男がいる。
時によれば毎日のように通ってくる。マダムに惚れているというより、女のドロドロしている家の雰囲気に鼻の下を伸ばしているようで、若い女の明け暮れのあらゆる肢体を楽しんでいるらしかった。この男がいる時、マダムの親戚の人が三人遊びに来て泊まっていった。親戚の前で、大っぴらに亭主扱いして添い寝するのも気が引け、客のようにあしらったが、男は帰ろうともせず、マダムは親戚の人たちと寝て、男は狭い家で外に寝る場所がないのを幸いに安さんの傍らにもぐり込み、雑魚寝した。
助平（すけべ）な男が、安さんの体に触れるのであろう。安さんは大げさに「キャー！」と騒ぐ。襖（ふすま）一枚向こうのマダムはイライラして眠れなかった。翌日親戚の人を送り出した後で、寝不足の咎（とが）...

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Quiet and person presence none. Old man’s house from shop two or three *cho* away is. On the way, under construction mostly finished house exists.
"An-san, here let’s take a rest," when Old Man said, An-san without fear, into this uninhabited vacant house followed and entered. Over forty oily Old Man, to daughter-like young woman clung, 
"An-san, it's okay right? With Yae-chan also before at an inn stayed, so you also won't mind, right?"
and unpleasantly whispered. Drunk and legs not standing An-san, on vacant house floor, kimono hem disarranged, cross-legged sat down,
"Old man, too much strange things don't say. People whatever, this An-san, don't underestimate. Strange imitation try and see, neighborhood all hearing big voice will let out so—Uwaaa!"
and like jungle roaring lion-like voice being raised, already my home also near and around here acquaintances many, people seen if shame-exposure, Old Man surprised,
"An-san such big voice don't let out even is okay. Already understood, hey so don't be angry, I to the shop, carry on back and return,"
and An-san coaxing humor took, her on back carrying to shop turned back. Failed passion’s outlet troubled while, at least on back transmitted woman’s skin warmth tasting only enjoyment endured, safely to shop sent back.

Somehow bar-maid to make mine with ulterior motive attending men, make mine if do mouth also light, like achievement immediately that to people leak things but, these men also still An-san "did something" not say place looking, unexpectedly that one point only firm seemed. Strange woman. Men to the end attract, and throw away is hobby. Despicable men An-san’s good toy being made.
Shop Madam’s "good husband" than, "young swallow" call way appropriate, six years younger, considerably money-turning good it seems, always proper clothing doing but, for Madam’s sake necessary above money absolutely not use, large-build and fair-skinned mouth-skilled man exists.
Depending on time every day like disappear [go there]. Madam fallen in love than, woman’s muddy house atmosphere at nose-under extending (leering), young woman’s dawn-to-dusk all limbs enjoying seemed. This man exists time, Madam’s relatives people three came to play and stayed. Relatives nearby, openly husband-treatment doing sleep-together also feeling bad, like guest treated but, man return did not, Madam with relatives people slept, man narrow house outside sleeping place none luckily An-san’s side crawled in, together-slept.
Lecherous man, An-san’s body touch probably. An-san exaggeratedly "Kyaa!" made fuss. Sliding door one beyond Madam irritated and could not sleep. Next day relatives people sent out after, sleep deprivation blame...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

The area was deathly quiet, with not a soul in sight. The old man’s house was a few blocks away from the shop. Along the way stood a house under construction, nearly finished.
"An-san, let’s take a breather here," the old man suggested. Without a hint of fear, An-san followed him into the empty building. The man, a greasy fellow in his forties, lunged at the girl who was young enough to be his daughter.
"Come on, An-san, it’ll be fine. I’ve stayed at an inn with Yae-chan before, so surely you won’t mind?" he whispered with a lecherous grin.
An-san, too drunk to stand, flopped down on the floor of the vacant house. Her kimono was in disarray as she sat cross-legged and barked back: 
"Old man, watch your mouth! You can think what you want of others, but don't you dare underestimate me. Just try something funny and I’ll scream so loud the whole neighborhood will hear! WAAAAAGH!"
She let out a roar like a lion in the jungle. Fearing the shame of being seen by the many acquaintances living nearby, the startled old man pleaded, "An-san! There's no need for that! I get it! Just stop being so angry. I'll carry you back to the shop myself."
He coaxed and flattered her, eventually hoisting her onto his back. Frustrated that his passions had found no release, he comforted himself with the simple warmth of her skin against his back as he hauled her back to the shop without further incident.

Men frequent the bar with the sole intent of "conquering" the hostesses. Usually, once they succeed, they can’t keep their mouths shut, boasting of their exploits like trophies. Yet, the fact that none of these men could claim to have had their way with An-san suggests that, in that one regard, she was surprisingly chaste. She was a peculiar woman; her greatest pleasure was to lure men in only to cast them aside at the last moment. The pathetic men were nothing more than toys to her.
Then there was a man who was less a "husband" to the Madam and more a "young swallow"—a kept man. Six years her junior, he seemed well-off and was always sharply dressed, yet he never spent a yen more than necessary on the Madam. He was a tall, fair-skinned man with a silver tongue.
He would hang around almost daily. It wasn't so much that he loved the Madam, but rather that he seemed to relish the "scandalous" atmosphere of the house, leering at the hostesses’ bodies from dawn till dusk. Once, three of the Madam’s relatives came to stay. Feeling awkward about acting like a married couple in front of family, the Madam treated him like a regular guest. But the man refused to leave. With the house so cramped and no other place to sleep, he took advantage of the situation and crawled into bed next to An-san.
Inevitably, the lecher reached out to touch her. An-san let out an exaggerated "Kyaaa!" making a huge scene. On the other side of the paper thin sliding door, the Madam lay awake, seething with irritation. The next day, after seeing the relatives off, the toll of her sleepless night...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a standard vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). It is divided into four columns.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of *Kyūjitai* (traditional kanji like 氣, 聲, 處) and some simplified forms, typical of the immediate post-WWII transition (Late 1940s–1950s).
*   **Illustration:** A central line-art drawing breaks the text columns. It depicts two women; one is semi-nude, washing herself with a wooden basin, while the other looks on or rests in the background. The art style is "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) lite, common in pulp magazines of the era.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text wraps around the illustration, suggesting the story and the visual are equally important for the reader's "entertainment."
*   **Pagination:** A simple "- 23 -" at the bottom center indicates this is part of a larger serialized story or a collection of short anecdotes.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** The text is quintessential *Kasutori* literature. Named after a low-quality shochu, these magazines were cheap, sensationalist, and focused on "the three S’s": Sex, Scandal, and Sports (or Satire). They flourished in the desperate but libertine atmosphere of occupied Japan.
*   **Jokyū (女給):** Translated as "waitress" or "hostess," these women worked in cafes and bars. In the pre-war and early post-war eras, the line between "service" and "sex work" was often blurred, making them frequent subjects of pulp fiction.
*   **Young Swallow (若いりばめ/若い燕):** This is a famous Japanese idiom (*Waka-i Tsubame*) referring to a younger male lover of an older woman. The term originated from a 1911 affair involving the feminist Raicho Hiratsuka.
*   **Residential Distance:** "Two or three *cho*" (二三丁) refers to an old unit of distance. One *cho* is approximately 109 meters.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **脂ぎった (Aburagitta):** Oily or greasy. Used here to describe the old man's unsavory, lustful appearance.
*   **あぐらをかく (Agura o kaku):** To sit cross-legged. For a woman in a kimono to do this was considered very unladylike and bold, signifying An-san's tough, unconventional character.
*   **鼻の下をのばす (Hana no shita o nobasu):** Literally "stretching the space under the nose." An idiom meaning to leer at women or be easily charmed/fooled by them.
*   **雑魚寝 (Zakone):** Sleeping together in a crowded room without personal space. Common in cramped post-war housing.
*   **なだめすかす (Nadamesukasu):** To coax, soothe, or wheedle.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Gender Dynamics:** The story highlights a power struggle. Men try to "conquer" hostesses, but An-san subverts this by being "firm" (*堅い*) and treating men as "toys" (*おもちゃ*). She uses her voice as a weapon (the lion's roar) to protect herself.
*   **The "Modan" (Modern) vs. Sordid Reality:** The "Young Swallow" character represents a hollow modernity—well-dressed and fair-skinned, but cheap and lecherous.
*   **Voyeurism:** The narrative and the illustration both invite the reader into private, "shameful" spaces (the vacant house, the bedroom, the bath).
*   **Economic Hardship:** The mention of living in a "narrow house" and relatives sleeping over reflects the housing shortages and communal living common in the 1940s/50s.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction / Pulp Anecdote
*   **Genre:** Ero-guro (Erotic-Grotesque), Social Satire, *Kasutori* literature.
*   **Themes:** Post-war Japan, Nightlife, Gender Politics, Lust, Humor.
