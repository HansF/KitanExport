## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

量です。それまで大体順調に使われていたのに、あの兇行の日、約十二ガロンが一度に消費され、それ以後全く止つています。これは京都大阪間を走るに要するガソリンの量は、大体四ガロンですから、その一倍半の往復に相当する距離を、その日、車は走つた事になります。
　その第二の証拠は、あの死体遺棄地点に、ダンロップタイヤの轍跡を認めました。
　その第三の証拠は、その自動車の車体の中から、高山式測定法により、少量の人の血の洩滴を検出しました。
　その第四の証拠は、六時京都発、八時前に堺着、それからすぐ引返して、帰院十時頃、この時間の一致であります。菅原看護婦は、薬剤が整わなかったと言っていますが、山科迄行くのに、そんなに時間はかかりません。九条保健所は五時に閉鎖される事は、よく知つていながら、そんな時間遅くに山科へ行くなんて、考えられません。山科保健所の宿泊員も、来客はなかつたと言っております。九条保健所の如きモデル保健所で整わないのに、Ｃ級よりまだ小さな、格外保健所へ行くなんて、常識でも考えられない事です。
　まだ二三の証拠はありますが、これを要するに、もう少し順序を立てて申し上げますと、菅原は三時半頃、自動車で病院を出て、その附近で待つているうちに、郁夫氏が出て来ました。そこで、いつも自動車で行くくせがあるので、今日もこの自動車で、堺分院まで送りましょうかといって、彼を誘い込み、麻薬タバコか何かで昏睡させます。そこですぐ殺したのでは、犯行都説が動かなくなり、自分が疑われてしまいますから、愛人を取られた怨のライバル、境稔子と郁夫氏が分院へ着いた頃を見計らって殺害します。
　九条保健所附近は、塔南小学校と日本電池の工場、空地などが周囲にあり秘かに人の一人位殺せます。そしてすぐ病院へ電話して、自分が京都に居る事を、故意に知らせます。わざわざ保健所の電話を使ったのも、第三者のアリバイ立証者を得る為です。そして死体を箱に入れ、堺へ運びびます。偶然それから間もなく死体は発見されましたが、発見がたとえ翌日になつても、検視によつて、死亡時間が午後六時頃と分ればいいんです。
　首の切断はそこで行われました。これは生体反応を調べれば、死体を切断したものか、生きている間に首を切ったものかは、すぐに分ります。そして運搬中の諸痕跡や何かを消す目的だったのでしょう。死体を裸体にして遺棄したのです。衣類は重みか何かをつけて、海か池に沈めれば、発見は困難です。
　恐ろしい嫉妬が生んだ惨劇、あの前夜に、二度も続けて、郁夫氏から濃厚に可愛がってもらわなかったら、境看護婦がこんなにも苦しまなくても済んだでしょうし、こんな恐ろしい悲劇は起らなかつたかも知れませんね。
　以上で、あたしの推理の概略はおしまいです。もう一度再検討されます事まいです。

量です。それまで大体順調に使われていたのに、あの凶行の日、約12ガロンが一度に消費され、それ以後全く止まっています。これは京都・大阪間を走るのに要するガソリンの量は大体4ガロンですから、その1.5倍の往復に相当する距離を、その日、車は走ったことになります。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

It is the amount. Until then, it was being used mostly normally, but on that day of the foul deed, about 12 gallons were consumed at once, and after that, it has stopped completely. This is because the amount of gasoline required to run between Kyoto and Osaka is roughly 4 gallons; therefore, on that day, the car traveled a distance equivalent to one and a half round trips.
The second piece of evidence: at that body dumping site, Dunlop tire tracks were recognized.
The third piece of evidence: from inside that car's body, by the Takayama-style measurement method, a small amount of human blood droplets were detected.
The fourth piece of evidence is the coincidence of the times: departing Kyoto at 6:00, arriving in Sakai before 8:00, then immediately returning, and arriving back at the hospital around 10:00. Nurse Sugawara says "the medicine wasn't ready," but to go as far as Yamashina does not take that much time...
(Omitted)
A tragedy born of terrible jealousy. If, on the night before, [she] had not been intensely "loved" by Mr. Ikuo twice in a row, Nurse Sakai might not have had to suffer this much, and such a terrible tragedy might not have happened.
With the above, the outline of my reasoning is finished. I hope it will be re-examined once more.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"It all comes down to the fuel consumption. Until that point, the car had been used at a normal rate, but on the day of the crime, twelve gallons were guzzled at once—and usage has ceased entirely since then. Considering it takes about four gallons to travel between Kyoto and Osaka, the car must have covered a distance equal to one and a half round trips that day.

The second piece of evidence involves the Dunlop tire tracks discovered at the site where the body was abandoned. Third, using the Takayama testing method, we detected trace amounts of human blood inside the vehicle. Fourth, we have a clear timeline: the car left Kyoto at 6:00 PM, arrived in Sakai before 8:00 PM, and returned to the hospital by 10:00 PM. Nurse Sugawara claims she had to travel because the necessary medicine wasn't available, but it doesn't take that long to get to Yamashina. Furthermore, she knew full well that the Kujo Health Center closes at 5:00 PM; the idea of her heading to Yamashina so late is absurd. The staff at the Yamashina center have already confirmed they had no visitors that night. It defies common sense that a 'model' facility like Kujo would lack supplies that a tiny, sub-Class C clinic would somehow possess.

This was a tragedy born of monstrous jealousy. Had Nurse Sakai not been so 'intensely' doted upon by Mr. Ikuo twice the night before, perhaps she would not have suffered so, and this horrific crime might never have occurred. That concludes the summary of my deduction. I ask that the facts be reviewed once more."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page uses a standard vertical-text layout (tate-gaki), common in Japanese periodicals.
*   **Typography:** The main text uses a standard Mincho-style font. Bold, larger fonts are used for section titles at the bottom to separate the "serious" detective story from the "gossip" section.
*   **Columns:** The text is arranged in four long vertical columns.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The detective story dominates the top two-thirds of the page, suggesting it is the primary content. The "Movie Star Stories" section is placed at the bottom, acting as "filler" or secondary entertainment.
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing at the bottom left depicts a dramatic, romantic embrace between a man and a woman, which serves as a visual hook for the sensationalist stories in the lower section.
*   **Pagination:** The page number "(106)" is centered at the very bottom.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** This text likely dates from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The mention of "gallons" (ガロン) reflects the influence of the American Occupation, as Japan transitioned between measurement systems.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This term refers to cheap, sensationalist magazines published after WWII. They often blended detective fiction, true crime, and eroticized celebrity gossip.
*   **Geography:** The narrative mentions specific locations in the Kansai region: Kyoto, Osaka, Sakai, Yamashina, and Kujo. This grounded realism was a staple of the "social detective" (shakai-ha) subgenre.
*   **Health Centers (保健所):** The mention of "Model Health Centers" (モデル保健所) refers to the post-war restructuring of the Japanese public health system under the Occupation.
*   **Tires:** "Dunlop tires" were a specific, high-quality brand name used to provide a sense of "modern" forensic detail.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **兇行 (Kyōkō):** An atrocious act or a foul deed. Often used in vintage crime reporting.
*   **轍跡 (Tesseki):** Tire tracks or ruts. A more formal/literary term than the modern *wadachi*.
*   **洩滴 (Eiteki/漏滴):** Droplets or leaks. Here used to describe bloodstains found in the car.
*   **格外 (Kakugai):** Exceptional or "off the charts." Here it refers to a health center that is so small it doesn't even fit the standard "C-class" ranking.
*   **濃厚に可愛がって (Nōkō ni kawaigatte):** Literally "intensely loved/cherished." In the context of Kasutori magazines, this is a common euphemism for sexual intercourse.
*   **異聞 (Ibun):** A strange tale or a side-story; often used for gossip or rumors.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Logic vs. Passion:** The top section emphasizes cold, forensic logic (gasoline calculations, tire tracks, blood tests) to solve a crime that was ultimately motivated by "terrible jealousy."
*   **Medical Professionals as Suspects:** The focus on doctors and nurses adds a layer of "professional drama," which was a popular trope.
*   **The "Femme Fatale" or Jealous Woman:** The text explicitly blames "terrible jealousy" (恐ろしい嫉妬) and suggests the tragedy was sparked by a specific sexual encounter the night before, reflecting the era's tendency to link crime with sexual morality.
*   **Post-War Modernity:** The inclusion of "Dunlop tires," "gallons," and "forensic blood testing" shows an obsession with Westernized, "scientific" modernity in contrast to the primal "jealousy" of the characters.
