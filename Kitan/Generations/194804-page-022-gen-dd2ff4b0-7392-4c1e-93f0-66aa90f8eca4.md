一、あまい密談の男女

昭和二十三年二月、節分のぉ化け髪で賑わう午後、名だたる大阪の南玄關、阿倍野橋大鐵百貨店の二階喫茶室で、ひそひそと語りあう一組の男女があった。
卓上にはフルーツ、洋菓子、コアの皿がすでに幾枚か重なり、灰皿には口紅のついたラッキーストライクと、三分の一ほどで捨てたピースがうづたかく盛られていた。
一分の隙もない、上品な最新流行型の外套に白絹のマフラー、リーゼントスタイルの頭髪、白い鹿皮の手袋をキチンと卓上に重ねている上流の立派な青年紳士と、Ｓ女専の制服を着た楚々とした清純な十八九の美少女であった。
喫茶ガールたちは、この相愛の愛人か、親に許された許婚者か知らないが、あまりにも若く美しい、そして富裕な二人に、羨望と嫉妬の眼差しをチラチラ交わせていた。
次々に入って来る客も、熱心に話しこんでいる二人の姿が眼に入ると、一様にニヤリと笑って、わざと二人から遠く離れた椅子を選ぶのが常だった。誰も邪魔するものは無い。

頬と頬がくつくばかり、卓上に顔を寄せあっている青年と少女の姿は、これから映畫館かダンスホールへ誘いあうたのしい戀の密談としか考えられなかった。静かに流れるビクトロラからのレコードの甘い旋律もこの微笑ましい情景にふさわしかった。
しかし、もし、この瞬間、この阿倍野繁華街一帯の治安を守る、阿野警察の至寶江本刑事が居合わせたならば、男女の密談から、次のような驚くべき會話の謎を敏感に聴きとったであろう。

「なあ、マサ公、お前、すこしこの頃のアクドイ稼ぎぶりを控えた方がいいぜ。チンピラ野郎どものドギモを抜くのはいいが、おれには、何だか心配になるんだ。江本のオヤヂの怖ろしさは、まだマサ公は経験していないから平気なんだろうが……」
「うふふ、大丈夫だってよ。そりゃあたしだって、秀ちゃんの好意はありがたいけど……。もし、あんたの言う江本のオヤヂが小耳に挟んでるとしたつてさ。あたし、うまく逃げるコツが判つてるのよ。」
「驚いたなあ、むろん素人じゃないだろうが、マサ公みたいに綺麗で上品なお嬢さんが、地下鉄の……。」
「しつ！、もつと聲を潜めなきゃ、誰に聞えるか知れやしないことよねえ、秀ちゃん、お説教はこれ位で堪忍してよ、アビコの参詣歸りのカモがうろうろしてるじゃないの。オキョちゃんも、おチッちゃんも、もうたんまり稼いでるにちがいないわねえ、行かしてよ。大丈夫だから……」
「そうかい。おれがこれぐらい止めてもやっぱりだめかい。しやうがねえやな、行って来な。その代り、二三上げ、カモを射止めたらアッサリ引揚げるんだぜ。おキョちゃんには定公が、おチッちゃんには友坊が、おれみたいに心配して待つてると傳えてくんな。」
「ウン、たしかに……。それから、落ちあうのはいつもの酒場だね？」
「そうだ。五時にあの二階へ三人揃つて来な。定公がサントリーの十年物を三四本都合してるんだ。ロースのうまい神戸肉を一貫目友坊が持つてくるしさ。なあ、節分の晩だ、うんとうまい物を食つて……。」
「オホホ、うふふ、なんとか人並みのことを言つてるよ。敵は案外、本能寺だろう。酔わしておいて何とやら……なんて古いわよ。」
「アハハハハ、察しがいいや。他人同志じゃあるまいし、暎はまた晩のことさ。行くはよいよい、歸りは怖いかい。呆れたお嬢さんだ。」
「ばか！でも、あんたは……。」
美少女は素早く周囲を見廻すと膝の上のスタイルブックを取り上げた。パッと立てた喫茶ガールたちへの屛風としたスタイルブックの蔭で熱さに溶けあうまゝ二人の唇が狂氣のように結ばれあつた。

「わからん、あいつの正体は一体何者なのだ。可愛い、色女の正体もつかめないなんて、この秀ちゃんも、これも惚れた弱身か、ふん。」
牝鹿のように、軽捷に、立ち去る美少女の後姿を見送りながら、青年紳士は照れたように自嘲の笑いを浮かべた。
秀公、彼こそ、阿倍野界隈三千の不良の上に君臨する夜の王者「南の三羽烏」の一味だったのである。

一、甘い密談の男女

昭和二十三年二月、節分のお化け髪で賑わう午後、名だたる大阪の南玄関、阿倍野橋大鉄百貨店の二階喫茶室で、ひそひそと語り合う一組の男女があった。
卓上にはフルーツ、洋菓子、ココアの皿がすでに幾枚か重なり、灰皿には口紅のついたラッキーストライクと、三分の一ほどで捨てたピースがうずたかく盛られていた。
一分の隙もない、上品な最新流行型の外套に白絹のマフラー、リーゼントスタイルの頭髪、白い鹿皮の手袋をきちんと卓上に重ねている上流の立派な青年紳士と、S女専の制服を着た楚々とした清純な十八、九の美少女であった。

「しっ！ もっと声を潜めなきゃ、誰に聞こえるか知れやしないことよねえ。秀ちゃん、お説教はこれくらいで勘弁してよ。我孫子（あびこ）の参詣帰りのカモがうろうろしてるじゃないの。オキョちゃんも、おチッちゃんも、もうたんまり稼いでるに違いないわねえ、行かせてよ。大丈夫だから……」
「そうかい。俺がこれくらい止めてもやっぱり駄目かい。しょうがねえやな、行って来な。その代わり、二、三件、カモを射止めたらあっさり引き揚げるんだぜ。オキョちゃんには定公が、おチッちゃんには友坊が、俺みたいに心配して待ってると伝えてくんな」
「うん、確かに……。それから、落ち合うのはいつもの酒場だね？」
「そうだ。五時にあの二階へ三人揃って来な。定公がサントリーの十年物を三、四本都合してるんだ。ロースの旨い神戸肉を一貫目友坊が持ってくるしさ。なあ、節分の晩だ、うんとうまい物を食って……」
「おほほ、うふふ、何とか人並みのことを言ってるよ。敵は案外、本能寺だろう。酔わしておいて何とやら……なんて古いわよ」
「あはははは、察しがいいや。他人同士じゃあるまいし、後はまた晩のことさ。行くはよいよい、帰りは怖いかい。呆れたお嬢さんだ」
「ばか！ でも、あんたは……」

Table top on, fruits, Western sweets, cocoa plates already several stacked, ashtray in, lipstick attached Lucky Strikes and, one-third about with discarded Peace (cigarettes) in a pile were heaped.
One minute of gap not-having, elegant latest fashion type overcoat to white silk muffler, regent style hair, white deerskin gloves neatly table on stacked-up high-class splendid young gentleman and, S-Women's-College's uniform wearing refined pure 18-19 beautiful girl was.
Tearoom girls, these mutually-loving lovers or, parents-by permitted fiancees or know not but, excessively young and beautiful, and wealthy two people at, envy and jealousy's glances flickeringly were exchanging.
One after another entering guests also, intently talking-together two people's figures eyes in enter when, uniformly "grin" laughing, purposely two people from far-away chairs choosing was the rule. No one to disturb existed.

Cheek and cheek almost touching, table on faces bringing-together youth and girl's figure, from now movie theater or dance hall to inviting-each-other happy love's secret-talk only than could not be thought. Quietly flowing Victrola from record's sweet melody also this heartwarming scene to was suitable.
However, if, this moment, this Abenobashi busy-district whole area's public-order protecting, Abeno Police's treasure Detective Emoto if present were, man-woman's secret-talk from, following like surprising conversation's mystery sensitively would have heard.

"Hey, Masa-ko, you, a bit these days' unscrupulous earning-manner should restrain better is. Chinpira-fellows' hearts-to-be-snatched-out (startling) is good but, to me, somewhat worry becomes. Emoto-the-Old-Man's dreadfulness, still Masa-ko has not experienced so unconcerned probably but..."
"Ufufu, it's okay I say. Well me too, Hide-chan's kindness is thankful but... even if, that what-you-say Emoto-the-Old-Man's small-ears-in (hearing) caught even if. I, well escaping knack know."
"Surprised I am, of course amateur not probably but, Masa-ko like beautiful and elegant young lady, subway's..."
"Shh! More voice must suppress, who to be heard not-know thing is, Hide-chan, preaching this much with forgive, Abiko's pilgrimage-return ducks (targets) wandering around aren't they. O-Kyo-chan too, O-Chitsu-chan too, already plenty earning must be, let me go. Because it's okay..."
"Is that so. I this much stop even if still no good. Can't be helped, go and come. Instead, two or three cases, ducks shoot-down if, cleanly withdraw. To O-Kyo-chan Sada-ko, to O-Chitsu-chan Tomo-bo, like me worrying waiting and tell-him please."
"Yeah, certainly... And then, meeting-up is usual bar right?"
"Right. 5 o'clock that second floor to three people together come. Sada-ko Suntory 10-year-old 3 or 4 bottles arranged has. Loin's tasty Kobe meat one kan-me Tomo-bo will bring. Hey, Setsubun's night, plenty tasty things eat..."

**The Mystery of the Three-Woman Pickpocket Gang**
**— The Bewitching Flowers of the Osaka Subway —**
**By Etsuji Oki**

**I. A Couple’s Sweet Whispers**

It was a February afternoon in 1948, a day bustling with the "Obake" masquerades of the Setsubun festival. In a second-floor tearoom of the Daitetsu Department Store at Abenobashi—the famed southern gateway to Osaka—a young man and woman sat huddled together, whispering.
On their table, plates from fruit, pastries, and cocoa were already stacked high. In the ashtray lay a mountain of cigarette butts: Lucky Strikes stained with lipstick and Peace cigarettes discarded after only a third had been smoked.
The man was a picture of upper-class sophistication: a perfectly tailored, trendy overcoat, a white silk muffler, hair styled in a sleek pompadour, and white deerskin gloves placed neatly on the table. Beside him was a girl of eighteen or nineteen, radiating a refined, virginal grace in her S-Women’s College uniform.
The waitresses watched them with a mix of envy and jealousy, unsure if they were passionate lovers or a well-to-do couple with their parents' blessing. Other patrons, seeing the pair so intensely focused on one another, would simply smirk and purposely choose seats far away. No one dared disturb them.

With their cheeks nearly touching, leaning in over the table, they looked like any other happy couple planning an evening at the cinema or a dance hall. The sweet melody drifting from a nearby Victrola gramophone only added to the heartwarming scene.
However, had Detective Emoto—the pride of the Abeno Police and guardian of the district’s peace—been present, his sharp ears would have picked up a startling mystery within their hushed tones.

"Listen, Masa," the man said. "You ought to tone down your aggressive 'work' lately. It's fine to shock the small-time punks, but it's making me nervous. You’ve never dealt with 'Old Man' Emoto; if you had, you wouldn't be so cavalier."
"Heh, I’ll be fine," she giggled. "I appreciate the concern, Hide, but even if that old man of yours gets wind of me, I know exactly how to give him the slip."
"It’s incredible. I know you're no amateur, but a girl as beautiful and elegant as you, working the subways..."
"Shh! Keep your voice down, or who knows who’ll hear! Look, Hide, enough with the lecture. There are plenty of 'ducks' wandering around returning from the Abiko shrine. Kyo and Chitsu must have made a killing by now. Let me go. I'll be fine."
"Fine. I guess I can't stop you. Go ahead then. But listen—once you’ve bagged two or three marks, get out of there. Tell Kyo that Sada, and Chitsu that Tomo, are waiting and worrying just like I am."
"Yeah, I got it. And we’re meeting at the usual bar, right?"
"Right. Be at that second-floor spot by five. Sada’s scrounged up three or four bottles of ten-year-old Suntory. Tomo’s bringing nearly four kilos of prime Kobe beef. It’s Setsubun, after all. Let’s eat like kings."
"Ohoho! Listen to you, talking like a normal person for once. But I know your game—get us drunk to get what you want? That’s an old trick, Hide."
"Haha, you're sharp. We’re hardly strangers, and the night is long. 'The way there is easy, but the return is treacherous,' eh? You're a piece of work."
"Idiot! But you..."
The girl scanned the room, then snatched up a fashion magazine from her lap. She snapped it open like a screen to block the waitresses' view, and behind it, their lips met in a kiss of desperate, melting passion.

"I still can't figure her out," the man muttered as he watched her leave. "Who is she really? I can't even unmask my own lover. I guess that's the price of being in love."
As he watched her disappear with the nimble grace of a doe, a self-deprecating smile crossed his face.
This "Hide"—Hide-ko—was, in fact, a member of the "Three Crows of the South," the kings of the underworld who reigned over the three thousand delinquents of the Abeno district.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Genre:** "Kasutori" literature (pulp fiction). This was a popular genre in post-war Japan characterized by sensationalism, crime, and eroticism.
*   **Layout:** Standard vertical Japanese layout (tategaki). The text is divided into four main columns.
*   **Typography:** The main title uses a bold, hand-drawn brush style with a graphic element (a hand holding a smoking cigarette), which was a common visual trope in noir/detective magazines.
*   **Visual Elements:** 
    *   **The Cigarette Hand:** Connects the smoke to the title, creating a sense of mystery and urban grit.
    *   **The Illustration:** A silhouette of a woman's legs in stylish shoes (top right) hints at the "Bewitching Flower" (femme fatale) theme.
*   **Sectioning:** The story is labeled "One" (一), indicating a serialized format or the first chapter of a short story.
*   **Hierarchy:** The title is largest, followed by the subtitle, author name, and then the body text. The use of furigana (reading aids) is minimal, suggesting an adult readership.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Showa 23 (1948):** This is the height of the Allied Occupation of Japan. The country was in ruins, and the "black market" (yami-ichi) was the center of economic life.
*   **Abenobashi / Tennoji:** The "South Gateway" (Minami no Genkan) refers to the Tennoji/Abeno area in Osaka, a major transport hub that was historically a rougher, more vibrant part of the city.
*   **The "Obake" (Ghost) Tradition:** During Setsubun (the day before spring), people in Osaka (especially in the entertainment districts) used to dress up in costumes (Obake) to ward off evil spirits. The story uses this festive chaos as a backdrop for crime.
*   **Luxury Items:** Lucky Strike cigarettes, Peace cigarettes, Suntory whisky, and Kobe beef were extreme luxuries in 1948. Their presence in the story emphasizes the "high-class" but illicit lifestyle of the criminals.
*   **S-Women's College (S-Jo-sen):** Refers to a "Joshi Senmon Gakko" (Women's Professional School). Students from these schools were seen as elite and refined, making the "pickpocket" reveal more shocking.
