## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Naked Girl (To the tune of "Banana Girl")

(1) Of a naked pilgrimage
Two daughters (maidens)
What [do they] pray [for]?
[They] kneel.
Must not look,
Men.
Flowers also are shy [at]
Nineteen's skin.
If [you] look, the maiden's
Dreams scatter.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Naked Maidens (To the tune of "The Banana Girl")**

(1) Two young maidens
On a naked pilgrimage—
What prayers are they offering
As they kneel so low?
Oh, you men, you must not look
Upon this skin of nineteen,
So fair it puts the flowers to shame.
For if you dare to steal a glance,
A young girl’s dreams will wilt and scatter.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This is a single-page feature likely from a "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine. It combines photography with lyrics intended to be sung to a popular melody of the time.
*   **Typography:** The main title is bold and vertical. The lyrics are written in a semi-cursive, handwritten style (gyōsho-influenced) that adds a personal, "poetic" touch.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and the "Cupid" illustration (hearts pierced by an arrow) are at the top, drawing the eye to the theme of romance/eroticism. The photograph of two nude women kneeling in a traditional setting takes up the lower two-thirds of the frame.
*   **Layout:** The text is justified to the top right. The photo is framed by a wavy, hand-drawn border, which was a common design trope in mid-century Japanese magazines to denote a "dreamy" or "special" feature.
*   **Composition:** The photo uses a stone lantern (*ishidoro*) and a traditional wooden building as a backdrop to create a sense of "sacred" or "traditional" space, contrasting sharply with the nudity.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** Likely the late 1940s or early 1950s. After WWII, Japan experienced a "pan-pan" culture and a surge in cheap, erotic pulp magazines known as *Kasutori-zasshi*. Censorship laws were in flux during the Allied Occupation, leading to a boom in "light erotica."
*   **"Banana Musume" (The Banana Girl):** The parenthetical note says the lyrics should be sung to the tune of "Banana Musume." This refers to a popular *ryūkōka* (pop song). Specifically, "Banana Musume" was a hit song from 1950 performed by Shizuko Kasagi, known for her energetic "Boogie Woogie" style. Using popular tunes for parodic or erotic lyrics was a common entertainment device.
*   **Hadaka Mairi (Naked Pilgrimage):** Traditionally, this refers to Shinto purification rituals (*misogi*) where participants (usually men) wear minimal clothing (fundoshi) in cold water. Repurposing this "sacred" concept for a female nude photo shoot is a typical example of post-war *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) sensibilities.
*   **The "Nineteen" Ideal:** The lyrics specify "nineteen" (*jūku*), which in the Japanese cultural context of the time represented the peak of youthful, "maidenly" beauty just before reaching full adulthood (historically 20).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ハダカ (Hadaka):** Written in katakana here for emphasis. It means "naked" or "bare."
*   **ひざまづく (Hiza-mazuku):** An older spelling (using づ) for "to kneel."
*   **花も恥らう (Hana mo shirau):** A classic idiomatic expression meaning "so beautiful that even the flowers feel shy/embarrassed by comparison." It is almost exclusively used to describe women in their late teens.
*   **十九の肌 (Jūku no hada):** Literally "skin of nineteen." This emphasizes youth and purity.
*   **夢が散る (Yume ga chiru):** "Dreams scatter" or "dreams are ruined." In this context, it suggests that the "purity" or "innocence" of the maiden is lost or broken if a man's gaze violates her "pilgrimage."

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism and Taboo:** The lyrics explicitly tell men "not to look," which acts as a psychological "reverse psychology" device. By framing the nudity as a "prohibited" or "sacred" act, it increases the erotic thrill for the male reader.
*   **Juxtaposition of Sacred and Profane:** The setting is a shrine/temple, and the act is a "pilgrimage," yet the subjects are nude. This play on traditional religious motifs for erotic purposes was a hallmark of post-war Japanese pulp media.
*   **Melancholy Eroticism:** The ending line about "dreams scattering" adds a layer of sentimentality (*mono no aware*) typical of Japanese pop lyrics, framing the eroticism as something fleeting and slightly tragic.
