今一人でひそかに思い出しても顔を眞赤にして冷汗をかく僕の一生一代の大恥かきの話なんです。
　　×　　×　　×
それは僕が丁度中學を卒業した年の初夏の夜の事です、隣村の叔父の家で法事があるといふので招かれて行きました。
叔父の家には、僕が幼い時よく一緒に遊んだことのある從妹がもう女學校に通う年頃になっていました。
僕は久しぶりに彼女に逢うのでいたての背廣なんどを着込んで澄まして行ったものでした。
その夜は從妹の近所の女友達も數人集つてきて庭に面した縁側で賑やかに談笑していました。
夕食も濟んで旅れを落すために風呂を借りることになって、彼女達に氣を配りながら、裸になって納屋の前の少し廣い小暗い所に据えてある露天風呂へおづ〜と浸りかけました。
もう初夏になったことゝて、障子なんかも開け放たれてあつたので座敷からもよく見通しが出来るのです
その時です、五つになる從弟が、風呂桶の傍へ寄つて僕を見ていました。突然、本當に突然でした。
「あらつ、兄ちゃんの××××に髯が生えてらあ――。」
体に似合わない男の子のトンキョウな大聲に僕はびつくりしました。
女學生が何人もいる前で何たる事ぞ！。馬鹿野郎とドナル事も出来ず羞しさに出顔も眞赤となつて、一言も發することも出来ず、本當に穴があれば入りたい気持で、羞恥と困惑に包まれてしまいました。
僕の其の時の哀れな、ドゥニモならない姿を御想像下さい。
居合せた外の客も田舎のことゝてあたりかまはず大笑いです。彼女達も俯いて、クス〜笑つています。
僕はほう〜の体で風呂から逃げ出しました。如何に無邪氣といっても、女學生の前で大恥をかかせられた怨みは今でも忘れられません。
その當時五つだつた彼も今ではを貰う年頃となつています。

昨年の春、講演のため或る地方へ出かけて、その土地で一等級と言われる旅館に泊つた。地方といっても市と呼ばれるだけの街であるので、丁寧に取り扱われ、總ての待遇は申分ない迄に行届いていた。
大變氣持よく夕食をとつた後、床をのべるように命じて、散歩かたがた町を見物に出かけた。
さて歸館して、自分の部屋に入つた途端にびつくりした。これはどうした事か、一つの床の上に坊主枕と女のする木枕の二つが並べてある。
「此れは又行き届いた優待だが、サービスも此所までくると至り盡せりだ」
の言葉をのまいだが、さてどんな女が来るかと、もう明日の講演なんか考えるひまもなく、どんな女だろうか、美人か、肥つた肉体美の女が、か細い柳腰の女か、等と思い出されて、はては、今迄旅の行きずりで情を暖めた女をあれにこれにと思い浮かべていると、果して一人の女が静かに入つてきた。
定めし赤い長襦袢一枚でスラリとした女が、フトンを捲くりあげないかと、ひたすら氣をもんでいた。
「――とうとうやつたわ、どんなもんだい。大したことはないぢやあないか――」。
花子は勝誇つて、いきなり大聲で叫びたいような氣持であつた。
客車の端の薄暗い場所で二人は赤皮のスーツケースを開けてみることになつた。
白く光る止金具はわけもなくパチンと開いた。息を呑んで中を覗き込んだ花子の顔。
すると、とたんに彼女は變な顔をした。
中味は札束と思いきや、意外にもボロ新聞紙がぎっしり詰つていた。あわてゝかき廻してみたが紙幣は只の一枚も出てこなかつた。フト見ると何やら書いてある白い紙片。花子はそれを手にとつて讀んでみた。
「――御苦労さん、くろがね――」
あつ蒼然、さては一昨晩わされたか――。呆然となつている花子の背後で突然笑聲が起つた。
「ハッハッハッハッ、どうしたんだい花子」
ぎよつとして振返つた花子。みるとそこには、意外も意外いつのまに來たのか先刻出し抜いたと思つていたあのチョボ髭紳士が立つているではないか。
「アッ……」
彼女は大げさに驚いた。
チョボ髭紳士はいきなりめがねをとりナボ髭をむしり取つた。
すると――あッ！、そこには、颯爽！ 鏡六平探偵のにこ〜顔が現われたではないか――。（終り）

今一人でひそかに思い出しても、顔を真っ赤にして冷や汗をかく僕の一生一代の大恥かきの話なんです。

それは僕がちょうど中学を卒業した年の初夏の夜のことです。隣村の叔父の家で法事があるというので招かれて行きました。
叔父の家には、僕が幼い時によく一緒に遊んだことのある従妹（いとこ）が、もう女学校に通う年頃になっていました。
僕は久しぶりに彼女に会うので、仕立ての背広などを着込んで澄まして行ったものでした。
その夜は従妹の近所の女友達も数人集まってきて、庭に面した縁側で賑やかに談笑していました。
夕食も済んで旅の疲れを落とすために風呂を借りることになって、彼女たちに気を配りながら、裸になって納屋の前の少し広い薄暗い所に据えてある露天風呂へおずおずと浸かりかけました。
もう初夏になったこととて、障子なんかも開け放たれていたので、座敷からもよく見通しができるのです。

「あらっ、兄ちゃんの××××に髭（ひげ）が生えてらあ――。」
体に似合わない男の子の頓狂（とんきょう）な大声に、僕はびっくりしました。

**Sensual Smiling Humorous Tales**
**Skit Collection**

**The Schoolgirl and the Mustache**
**By Taki Tanehiko**

Even now, [when I] secretly remember alone, [it is] a story of my once-in-a-lifetime great embarrassment that makes [my] face turn bright red and [me] break into a cold sweat.
    *   *   *
It was a night in early summer of the year [when] I had just graduated middle school. Because [there] was a Buddhist memorial service at [my] uncle's house in the neighboring village, I was invited and went.
At [my] uncle's house, a female cousin whom I used to play with often when I was young had already reached the age to attend girls' school.
Since I was meeting her after a long time, I wore a newly tailored suit and went acting composed.
That night, several female friends from the cousin's neighborhood gathered and were talking and laughing lively on the veranda facing the garden.
Dinner finished, and to wash away the fatigue of travel, [I] decided to borrow the bath; while paying attention to those girls, [I] stripped naked and timidly began to soak in the outdoor bath installed in a slightly wide, dim place in front of the shed.
Since it had already become early summer, things like sliding doors were left wide open, so a clear view was possible even from the guest room.
It was at that time. A five-year-old male cousin came near the bathtub and was looking at me. Suddenly, truly suddenly.
"Oh! On the brother's [XXXXX], a mustache is growing—."
At the boy's freakishly loud voice, which did not suit his body, I was startled.
What a thing [to happen] in front of many schoolgirls! I couldn't even yell "You idiot," and my face became bright red with shame; I couldn't utter a word, and truly with the feeling of wanting to enter a hole if there were one, I was wrapped in shame and confusion.
Please imagine my pathetic, helpless state at that time.
The other guests who happened to be there, it being the countryside, laughed loudly without regard for surroundings. Those girls also looked down and were giggling.
I fled from the bath in a state of desperation. No matter how innocent [he was], the grudge of being made to suffer great shame in front of schoolgirls cannot be forgotten even now.
He, who was five at that time, has now reached the age to take [a wife].

**Erotic Humors: A Collection of Skits**

**The Schoolgirl and the Beard**
**By Tanehiko Fuyuki**

Even now, when I recall this incident in private, my face flushes crimson and I break into a cold sweat. It is, without a doubt, the single most mortifying moment of my entire life.

It happened on an early summer night, the year I graduated from middle school. I had been invited to my uncle’s house in a neighboring village for a memorial service. My female cousin, who had been my constant playmate when we were children, was now old enough to attend a girl's high school. Since it had been ages since we last met, I made sure to dress up in a sharp, newly tailored suit, doing my best to look sophisticated.

That evening, several of her friends from the neighborhood had gathered, and they were all chatting and laughing gaily on the veranda overlooking the garden. After dinner, I went to use the bath to wash off the grime of my travels. Mindful of the young ladies nearby, I stripped down and timidly slipped into the outdoor tub, which was tucked away in a dim, open space in front of the shed. Because it was early summer, the paper doors of the main house had been left wide open, providing a clear line of sight from the guest rooms.

Right then, my five-year-old male cousin wandered over to the tub and started staring at me. Then, without warning—absolutely out of the blue—he piped up.

"Oh! Look! Big brother has a mustache growing on his [private parts]!"

I was shell-shocked by the boy's shrill, booming voice. To think such a thing was shouted in front of a group of schoolgirls! I couldn't even bring myself to bark "Shut up, you brat!" My face burned a deep scarlet; I was utterly speechless. I felt as if I wanted to crawl into a hole and die, consumed by sheer shame and bewilderment.

Please, just imagine my pathetic, helpless state. Being the countryside, the other guests didn't bother to hide their amusement and erupted into boisterous laughter. The girls all looked down, unable to hide their giggles. I scrambled out of the bath and fled in total disgrace. No matter how "innocent" he might have been, I can never forgive him for humilitating me like that in front of those girls.

That boy, who was only five then, is now old enough to be looking for a wife of his own.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page follows a standard vertical-text layout common in Japanese periodicals. It uses a multi-column structure (two main stories).
*   **Typography:** The title "艷笑諧譚" (Ensho Kaitan) uses a bold, stylized "display" typeface to grab attention. The "Konto-shu" sub-header is encased in a graphic box with a bold, almost woodblock-style font. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the largest element, followed by story titles, and then the body text. There is a small, somewhat crude illustration at the top right showing a figure (possibly in a bath or bed) which hints at the "erotic" nature of the content.
*   **Censorship:** The use of "××××" in the first story indicates the "banned" or "vulgar" word for genitals (likely *manko* or *chimpo*), a common practice in publications of this era to bypass obscenity laws while still communicating the joke.
*   **Paper Quality:** The yellowed, fibrous appearance suggests "Kasutori" paper—cheap, low-quality paper used during the post-war period when resources were scarce.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Magazines:** These were pulp magazines popular in Japan between 1946 and 1955. Named after a cheap, dregs-based shochu (alcohol), they were intended to be "consumed" quickly and then discarded. They focused on "3S": Screen (movies), Sports, and Sex (eroticism).
*   **Education System:** The narrator mentions graduating "Middle School" (中学) and his cousin attending "Girls' School" (女学校). This refers to the pre-war/early post-war educational system (the "Old System"), where middle schools were typically gender-segregated.
*   **Rotenburo/Outdoor Baths:** In rural Japan of that era, baths were often semi-outdoor or located in outbuildings. The lack of privacy described (open *shoji* doors) was a common trope in "accidental exposure" humor.
*   **The "Mustache" Joke:** This is a classic "innocence of childhood" trope where a child, seeing pubic hair for the first time on an older relative, confuses it with facial hair. In a culture that was becoming more self-conscious about westernized notions of "privacy" and "modesty," this clash of rural openness and youthful embarrassment was a staple of humor.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **艷笑 (Enshō):** Literally "voluptuous/erotic smile." Refers to stories that are mildly erotic or suggestive.
*   **諧譚 (Kaitan):** Humorous stories or jokes.
*   **コント (Konto):** From the French *conte* (short story). In Japanese, it specifically refers to a short, comedic skit or "drollery."
*   **おづ〜と (Ozu-ozu-to):** Timidly, hesitantly.
*   **トンキョウ (Tonkyō):** 頓狂. Acting weirdly, suddenly, or with a freakish tone of voice.
*   **ほう〜の体 (Hō-hō no tei):** ほうほうの体. To flee in a state of utter confusion or disgrace; to beat a hasty retreat.
*   **柳腰 (Yanagigoshi):** "Willow waist." A poetic term for a slender, graceful woman's waist.
*   **チョボ髭 (Chobo-hige):** A small, "Charlie Chaplin" style or "toothbrush" mustache.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Puberty and Shame:** The primary theme is the transition from childhood to adulthood. The narrator's pride (the new suit, the "composed" attitude) is shattered by the biological reality of his maturing body being pointed out by a child.
*   **Rural vs. Urban/Modern:** The narrator tries to act sophisticated ("仕立ての背広" - tailored suit), but is undone by the "innocence" and lack of privacy in the countryside ("田舎のこととて").
*   **Voyeurism and Exposure:** The humor relies on the tension of being watched. The open *shoji* and the outdoor bath create a stage where the narrator's private transition to manhood is made public.
*   **The Detective Twist:** In the second story, the subtext is the "honey trap" or "inn expectation" common in period fiction, which is subverted by a detective story trope (the disguise).
