### 3️⃣ Literal English Translation

**Lustful Tastes: A Collection of Hobbies**

Thinking of everything up to now, the deep emotion is profound.
But what I write here now
is not those old stories.
A woman called Oshin-san appeared. Around thirty-seven or thirty-eight, fair-skinned, double eyelids.
A, I, Ku, Ha, Ri, Tsu, Ta (phonetic list, possibly a chant or misspelling).
Undoubtedly a female body, yet a maiden who has never been embraced by a man.
It is a tale like the senryū [poem] about regretting having to dig the well at the very end.

---

(Right Side)

His foot touches me. Jiro immediately closed his eyes upon seeing it, but heated up, crying childishly, [he said,] "Just do as Auntie says, alright!..." and somehow fell [into it]. The lamp was lit nearby, and while I thought it dazzling, the *sumimono* [ejaculate/fluid] was suddenly pushed in, and embracing Mother (?), I ripped my clothes and his apart, grasping Jiro and collapsing onto the darkness as if dying. Becoming an object/tool (*gu ni natte*)... If that happens, you become a person, yes, becoming an object/tool... It’s useless to say anything more ahead. Therefore, I, who was embraced by one part (a male), was now dividing [myself].

At that time, there were two *Kando* [sessions/rounds] every night. Even now, I frequently divide [myself/my attention], but recently, perhaps because I saw *shunga* [erotic prints], I look at them while embracing Jiro, feeling detached and cold (*hiyahiya*).

(Center Graphic: **Ehon-tai** [Erotic Book])

(Left Side)

I confirmed that detached/cold body for a week, and then performed the act once. However, thinking back to everything before that, maybe it has been five times? The female body is complex.
And then, for the first time, I achieved the state that "Auntie" talked about—a body that felt somehow folded or twisted, and I couldn't tell who was holding me.
Now, thinking of everything up until that point, reaching this kind of state, which seems like entering the deepest place of a human being, was for the first time.
And recently, while being held by Jiro, I asked him how to achieve the "gunk, gunk" feeling/body that Auntie described.
Jiro said, "It’s no good unless it goes in much deeper."
(End)

(Bottom Left Caption)

Thus,
The approaching *o-iro* [lust/color]
is a final state
that is said to bloom quietly.
The body that frequently speaks
of whether it knows or not
how to handle the awkwardness
of the *burari* faction [the hanging/loose faction].

**Erotic Hobbies: A Collector's Showcase**

Reflecting on everything that came before, I am filled with deep emotion.
But what I intend to write about now
is not merely the recollections of the past.
A woman named Oshin-san appeared. She was thirty-seven or thirty-eight, fair-skinned, with double eyelids.
She was a full, ripe female body,
yet she was a maiden who had never known a man’s embrace.
It’s a story akin to the senryū: "What a pity the well is dug only at the closing hour."

---

(Right Side)

His foot touched me. Jiro instantly closed his eyes, overcome with feverish excitement. “Just do as Auntie told you, alright!” he cried out childishly, and somehow, he succumbed. The lamp was close, shining brightly, and just as the light overwhelmed me, the fluid (*sumimono*) was thrust sharply inside. Embracing Mother (?), I tore our clothing apart. I held Jiro and fell back onto the dark surface as if I were dying. I became a vessel—a mere tool. If you cross that threshold, you truly become human; you become a tool... there is little left to explain.

Thus, I, who had been held passively by one part [of him], now began to analyze and categorize [my own experience].

At that time, we achieved two sessions (*Kando*) every night. Even now, I still categorize the experience frequently, but lately—perhaps because I’ve been looking at *shunga*—I find myself observing them while embracing Jiro, feeling oddly cold and detached.

(Center Graphic: **Erotic Book**)

(Left Side)

I retained that cold, analytical body for a week, and then we had sex one time. But recalling the past, maybe I’ve done it five times? The female body is complex.
And it was only then that I achieved, for the first time, the condition that "Auntie" described: a feeling of being crumpled or folded, where I honestly couldn't tell who was embracing me.
Now, remembering everything up to that point, achieving this state—which felt like reaching the deepest core of a human being—was a true first.
Just recently, while Jiro was holding me, I asked him how to reach that "gunk-gunk" body state that Auntie talked about.
Jiro replied, "It won’t happen unless I penetrate much deeper."
(End)

---

(Bottom Left Caption)

Therefore,
the impending *color* (lust)
is a final state
said to bloom quietly.
A body that constantly asks
whether one knows how
to handle the awkwardness
of the "Wavering Faction."

### 5️⃣ Structural & Editorial Metadata

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Likely Section Type:** Confessional Reportage or Fictionalized Reader Letter (often called *Tōkō* or *Shuki* in this genre). It presents highly personal sexual experience under a clinical or quasi-scholarly header ("Collection of Hobbies").
*   **Magazine Context:** The title "好色 趣味のコレクション" (Lustful Tastes, A Collection of Hobbies) suggests this piece belongs to an ongoing feature cataloging various forms of erotic behavior, fetish, or sexual initiation, typical of *Kitan Club*'s style of intellectualizing ero-guro.
*   **Author Attribution:** Not explicitly given, presented as a first-person narrative (私, I) or diary entry, implying authenticity but likely heavily ghostwritten or edited by the magazine staff.
*   **Editorial Voice:** The header and the final caption provide a detached, categorizing editorial voice, framing the narrator's emotional and physical journey as a "collection item" or a "type" (e.g., "末な体" - a final body/state).
*   **Narrator Voice:** Intensely personal, analytical, focused on physical sensation and comparison (comparing Jiro's performance to "Auntie's" description). The use of specialized terms like *Kando* (乾度) suggests the narrator has adopted the magazine's clinical vocabulary.
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in sexual initiation, the "hidden complexities" of the female body (*Jotai wa fukuzatsu da*), and the comparison between lived experience and idealized erotic depiction (*Shunga*/ *Ehon*).
*   **Visual Structure:** Highly modernist/avant-garde layout, featuring a large, angled black graphic that disrupts the narrative flow and draws attention to the central large type "艶本" (Erotic Book), physically linking the private sexual experience (the narrative) with the external medium of print erotica.

### 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Annotations

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Publication Context (Mid-Showa Era):** The text reflects the post-war Japanese intellectual fascination with exploring and classifying sexual deviance and non-traditional sexual lives, often merging genuine confessional material with sensationalism. The clinical tone and use of specific, often invented, sexual vocabulary (like *Kando*) are hallmarks of magazines like *Kitan Club* or *Fūzoku Kitan*.
*   **Oshin-san:** The characterization (37-38, virgin, fair-skinned) sets her up as a late bloomer or a "preserved" object, increasing the titillation of her initiation story. 37-38 was considered past the usual age for sexual debut in this period, underscoring her deviation from the norm.
*   **The Proverb (Shimai no Ido o Semete):** 「仕舞の井戸をせめて」 (Shimai no Ido o semete) is a powerful cultural marker, meaning roughly "regretting the need to dig the well only when the day is done." It implies Oshin-san is regretting her long period of chastity now that she understands pleasure.
*   **"Auntie" (お小母さん - O-oba-san):** This figure is crucial. She serves as the experienced sexual guide, providing the novice narrator with the lexicon and goals (the "gunk gunk body") for advanced pleasure. This figure often represents traditional or professional sexual knowledge, contrasted with the clumsy, youthful male partner (Jiro).
*   **The "Mother" Reference:** The line "母を抱き" (embracing Mother) while embracing Jiro is startling. It could be a typo (e.g., confusion with "枕" *makura*, pillow), a momentary confusion in the darkness, or a profound psychological indicator of Oedipal anxiety, merging the sexual act with a return to the maternal. Given the era's focus on psychoanalysis (though often popularized), the latter is plausible within *Kitan Club*'s framework.
*   **Shunga and Ehon-tai:** The explicit mention of *Shunga* (erotic prints) and the use of the large graphic **艶本** (Erotic Book/Sample) emphasizes how printed erotica influenced sexual practice in the Showa era, transforming private acts into performances influenced by external media—a true "collection of hobbies."
*   **"Gunk, Gunk" Body (ぐん、ぐん):** A highly specific onomatopoeic description, likely referring to the deep, spasmodic contractions or surges felt during deep penetration or orgasm, showing the narrator attempting to verbalize a deeply private physical state.

### 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term | Original Kanji/Kana | Contextual Meaning | Historical/Erotic Nuance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **好色** | 好色 | Lust / Eroticism / Sensuality | Standard descriptor for the genre; emphasizes the pursuit of pleasure. |
| **済物** | 済物 | Seminal fluid / Ejaculate | A clinical or euphemistic term for semen, common in older erotic literature to avoid vulgarity. |
| **具になつて** | 具になつて | Becoming an object / A tool / A vessel | Highly significant. Denotes the loss of self-will and the transformation into a purely physical, functioning sexual instrument (a core ero-guro theme). |
| **乾度** | 乾度 | Session / Round / Cycle | Non-standard term. Possibly an abbreviation or a coded word used in the sexology context of the time, likely meaning a count of sexual acts or orgasms. |
| **女体は複雑だ** | 女体は複雑だ | The female body is complex | Reflects the intellectualization of female sexuality as a mysterious, difficult subject requiring study (the magazine's mission). |
| **をりくつたやうな体** | をりくつたやうな体 | A body that felt twisted/folded/crumpled | Description of intense, confusing, or transformative sexual pleasure, often associated with deep female orgasm. |
| **お色** | お色 | Lust / Sexual atmosphere | Euphemism for sex or erotic inclination ("color"). |
| **ぶらり派** | ぶらり派 | The Wavering/Hanging Faction | Likely refers to those who are hesitant, awkward, or passive in sexual matters (the opposite of the proactive Auntie figure). |

### 8️⃣ Thematic & Subtext Analysis

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Sexual Initiation and Education:** The central theme is the late sexual awakening of Oshin-san, driven not by passion but by curiosity and external instruction ("Auntie").
*   **The Intellectualization of Sex:** The narrator immediately adopts a clinical, observational stance, using technical language and treating her own body as a specimen ("cold and detached," "confirmed that detached body"). This is the magazine's primary editorial strategy.
*   **Media and Sexual Performance:** The placement of the **艶本** graphic and the subsequent reflection that the narrator is "looking at *shunga* while embracing Jiro" suggests that the written/visual medium dictates or influences the reality of the sexual act. Her dissatisfaction stems from Jiro’s inability to deliver the idealized pleasure described by Auntie or perhaps depicted in the books.
*   **Power and Passivity:** The line "I became a tool" (*gu ni natte*) highlights a submission fantasy, but it is a submission that paradoxically allows the narrator to feel more "human" and gain access to deeper physical truths.
*   **The Unattainable Ideal:** The "gunk gunk body" and Jiro's assertion that he must penetrate "deeper" establish a theme of perpetual seeking; true, profound pleasure is elusive and always just out of reach, maintaining the narrative tension.

### 9️⃣ Content Flags (For Downstream Processing)

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** High Intensity (Explicit descriptions of coitus, fluid exchange, and specific arousal states).
*   **Violence:** Low (The description of collapse and tearing clothes is dramatic/sensational, but not overtly violent or non-consensual; however, the coercion by the "Auntie" via Jiro is implied).
*   **Coercion:** Medium (The act is initiated under pressure: "Just do as Auntie says, alright!").
*   **Medical / Bodily Themes:** Clinical, quasi-sexological focus (description of *Kando*, female body complexity, specific penetration depth requirements).
*   **Taboo or Illegal Implications:** Mentions of printed erotica (*Shunga*, *Ehon*) which were subject to censorship at the time.
