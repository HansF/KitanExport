自分の生命を賭したアルプス球団を追われた私は、疲労し衰弱し切った身体をとうとう厚かましく白末画伯の邸へ運びました。
「失敗は人生の良薬だよ。なあに、君は若いんだ、ものの一ヶ月もここでゆっくり静養すれば全快するさ。アルプスだけがプロチームじゃないよ、僕がいずれ世話してやるから、またいいチームで投手として復活しろよ」清水早百合とのスキャンダルを一から十まで知り尽くしながら、一言もそれに触れないで力強く慰めてくれる画伯の温情に、私は男泣きに泣きました。
「おい、静枝、アトリエの横のサンルームが温かくていいな。当分あの部屋で養生させようじゃないか。しっかり看病してやってくれよ」
「はい……」
　そうして私は画伯の邸の居候となりました。明るくて温かい絵ガラス張りのサンルーム、眼の下には絵のような大阪湾の風光が開け、後ろには、初冬らしい肌の六甲山脈が見晴らせました。この大きな邸には画伯夫妻と、若い女中が一人、その他には猟の好きな画伯の愛犬である純粋のセッター種の犬が居るだけの静かな住居でした。三度の食事は、夫人が特別に心を込めて作ってくれました。それを女中さんが運んで来てくれるのです。

「おや、ここにいらっしゃいましたの。居間へおいでなさいな、女中とラジオを聞いていますのよ」
　静枝夫人が入ってきました。そのすんなりとした和服の下に、いつかモデルとなって、このクッションに横たわっていた夫人の見事な肉体が隠されている……。私はアブサンをぐっと飲み干すと、まじまじと夫人の姿態を見つめました。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(I) was. And, this time, toward the Alps Ball Park's arch-rival St. Paul's handsome pitcher K, (she) began to extend the hand of the next temptation... What she wanted was, rather than my flesh, likely nothing more than the title of "Alps' popular pitcher."

　　　IV

Having been driven out of the Alps Ball Park where I had staked my life, my fatigued and completely weakened body I finally, impudently, carried to the residence of Master Shirosue (Gahaku).
"Failure is life's good medicine. Come now, you are young, if you take a slow rest here for just one month, you will fully recover. The Alps is not the only pro team; I will look after you eventually, so revive as a pitcher in another good team." While knowing from one to ten the scandal with Sayuri Shimizu, without touching upon it even for a word, at the Master’s benevolence in strongly comforting me, I cried a manly cry.
"Hey, Shizue, the sunroom next to the atelier is warm and good; let's have him convalesce in that room for the time being, shall we? Please nurse him well."
"Yes..."
And so I became a dependent at the Master’s residence. In the bright and warm glass-walled sunroom, below my eyes the scenery of Osaka Bay opened like a painting, and behind, the winter-like ridge of the Rokko Mountains could be seen. In this large residence, there were the Master and his wife, one young maid, and other than that, only the Master’s beloved pure setter-breed dog who liked hunting lived in that quiet dwelling. The three meals, the wife specially with heart made for me. The maid would carry them to me.
"I am going on a sketching trip toward Nanki for a while, you see. Well, if things go a certain way, I might be away for about a month, but I trust you with the house-sitting. If you want to drink liquor, in the atelier shelf bottles as you desire are lined up, so please help yourself without hesitation."
After the Master left casually saying so, in the house that had become deathly silent, sometimes I heard the wife, while playing the piano, practicing various songs in a beautiful alto. Like a mother’s breast, sweet, gentle, and holy, that singing voice—my flesh fouled muddily by the animal-like festering lust with the temptress Sayuri Shimizu, and my wounded soul—seemed as if they were being purely purified. Ah, but what a miserable and shameless crime I, a man, committed. Mrs. Shizue, whom I had yearned for purely like a mother or an older sister, her beautiful flesh I violated one night.
It was a night when snow was falling silently and deeply. Since I had been permitted by the Master, I entered the atelier, and from among the colorful Western liquor bottles lined up on the bookshelf, I took down one bottle of Absinthe. Light like a dream, yet strong in alcohol content, Absinthe is the Western liquor the Master and I like most. As I settled deeply into the cushions, I poured Absinthe into the glass until it brimmed. At that time, the door opened quietly.
"Oh, so you were here. Please come to the living room; I am listening to the radio with the maid."
Mrs. Shizue came in. Under that slender Japanese garment, the wife’s splendid flesh, which had once become a model and lain on these cushions, was hidden... I gulped down the Absinthe and stared intently at the wife’s figure.
Before that dawn, known by no one, I escaped from the sunroom window. Having violated the wife, how could I brazenly stay on in the Master’s house? To live, to eat, I cast myself into the group of day laborers at the Osaka port. Doing heavy labor with a body already weakened caused me to develop acute pulmonary tuberculosis.
Mrs. Shizue’s suicide by poison, that it was not caused by artistic worries as reported, I understand piercingly.
Only, no matter how much I mourn, I cannot finish regretting that temptress actress Sayuri Shimizu. I am one of the great fools dying having had my soul sucked dry by her. Just like a pathetic fly caught in a joro-gumo (ogre spider) web...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

...she had already moved on. This time, she began casting her seductive net toward Pitcher K, the handsome star of St. Paul, the Alps Ball Park’s arch-rival. It seems it wasn't my body she ever wanted, but merely the prestige of being "the Alps' star pitcher."

　　　IV

Driven out of the Alps Ball Park—the place where I had staked my very life—I dragged my exhausted and withered frame to the estate of Master Shirosue. It was a brazen move, but I had nowhere else to go.
"Failure is the best medicine life can offer," the Master said warmly. "Come now, you’re young. A month of quiet rest here and you'll be as good as new. The Alps isn't the only pro team in the world. I’ll pull some strings for you eventually; just focus on making your comeback as a pitcher with a better club." Though he knew every sordid detail of my scandal with Sayuri Shimizu, he didn't breathe a word of it. His kindness moved me to tears—tears of a broken man.
"Shizue," he called out, "the sunroom next to the studio is warm. Let’s let him recover there for a while. See that you look after him well."
"Yes..." she replied softly.
And so, I became a guest at the Master’s home. From the bright, warm, glass-walled sunroom, the view of Osaka Bay stretched out like a masterpiece below, while the winter-hued peaks of the Rokko Mountains loomed behind. It was a quiet household, occupied only by the Master, his wife, a young maid, and the Master’s favorite hunting dog, a purebred setter. My meals were prepared with special care by the Mistress herself and brought to me by the maid.
"I’m heading off on a sketching trip to the Nanki region for a while," the Master told me one day. "I might be gone for a month or so, but I’m leaving the house in your hands. If you fancy a drink, the shelves in the studio are stocked with whatever you like. Don't be shy."
After he departed, leaving the house in a profound silence, I would often hear the Mistress practicing songs in a beautiful alto voice, accompanied by the piano. Her voice was as sweet and holy as a mother’s touch. It felt as though it were washing away the filth of my soul and my body, which had been corrupted by a raw, animalistic lust for that siren, Sayuri Shimizu. Oh, but what a wretched, shameless sinner I turned out to be! One night, I violated the beautiful body of Mrs. Shizue—the very woman I had revered as a mother and a sister.
It happened on a night of thick, silent snowfall. Having the Master’s permission, I entered the studio and took down a bottle of Absinthe from the colorful array on the bookshelf. Ethereal yet potent, Absinthe was the favorite of both the Master and myself. As I sank into the cushions and filled my glass to the brim, the door creaked open.
"Oh, so this is where you’ve been," she said. "Come to the living room; the maid and I are listening to the radio."
Mrs. Shizue stepped inside. Beneath her elegant kimono lay the magnificent body that had once posed as the Master’s model on these very cushions. I drained my glass and stared at her, unable to look away.
Before dawn, I slipped out of the sunroom window without a word to anyone. Having defiled the Mistress, how could I remain in the Master’s house? To survive, to keep myself fed, I descended into the world of day laborers at the Osaka docks. The grueling physical labor, forced upon a body already at its breaking point, brought on a sudden case of tuberculosis.
I know now, with a clarity that pierces my soul, that Mrs. Shizue’s suicide by poison was not due to "artistic torment," as the papers claimed.
Yet, no matter how I mourn, I can never truly forgive that temptress, the actress Sayuri Shimizu. I am just another fool who had his soul sucked dry by her—a pathetic fly caught in the web of a spider.
(The End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This is a single-page layout from a mid-20th-century Japanese magazine. The text is arranged in a traditional vertical format, reading from top-to-bottom and right-to-left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in post-war printing. It uses iteration marks (*odori-ji*) like "ゝゝ" for "とうとう" (toutou) and "ろゝ" for "どろどろ" (dorodoro). The numbering "四" (Four) indicates this is a specific chapter or installment of a serial.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration dominates the upper left quadrant. The text wraps around the illustration, creating a dynamic visual flow. The text in the center-right column is indented to create space for the bottom of the illustration's frame.
*   **Illustration:** A hand-drawn sketch of a woman with Western-style features and wavy hair, resting her head on her hand. This style was very popular in "Kasutori" magazines of the late 1940s and 50s, emphasizing a "modern" and slightly eroticized aesthetic. The name "TOSHIYUKI" is written in the upper left, likely the artist's signature.
*   **Column Structure:** The page is divided into three main vertical registers, though the text flows continuously. The "The End" (完) mark at the bottom right indicates the conclusion of the story.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** Likely the late 1940s to early 1950s (Showa 20s). The themes of decadence, ruined athletes, and "forbidden" lust are hallmarks of the *Kasutori* culture—short-lived, cheap magazines that catered to the escapist and often prurient interests of the post-war Japanese public.
*   **Baseball References:** The mention of the "Alps Ball Park" (アルプス球園) and "St. Paul" (セントパール) are likely thinly veiled fictionalizations of real Japanese professional baseball teams. "Alps" refers to the famous "Alps Stand" at Koshien Stadium, home of the Hanshin Tigers. The post-war era saw a massive boom in the popularity of professional baseball.
*   **Decadence & Absinthe:** The mention of Absinthe (アプサン) highlights the bohemian or "decadent" lifestyle of the painter and the narrator. Absinthe has long been associated with artists and the "dangers" of Western luxury in Japanese literature (e.g., Osamu Dazai).
*   **Public Health:** The narrator contracting "acute pulmonary tuberculosis" (急性肺結核) reflects the reality of post-war Japan, where TB was a leading cause of death and often associated with poverty and overwork (the "national disease").
*   **Social Morality:** The narrative arc involves a fall from grace (sports star to day laborer) triggered by a "temptress" (the actress). This "Femme Fatale" trope was common in the pulp fiction of the era, reflecting anxieties about changing gender roles and Westernized "modern girls."

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **画伯 (Gahaku):** A respectful title for a master painter. It implies status and artistic authority.
*   **居候 (Isōrou):** A person who lives in someone else's house without paying for room and board; a "hanger-on" or "dependent."
*   **妖婦 (Yōfu):** A temptress, siren, or enchantress. Often used in pulp fiction to describe a dangerous, seductive woman.
*   **のめのめと (Nome-nome to):** An adverb meaning shamelessly, brazenly, or without a sense of guilt.
*   **服毒自殺 (Fukudoku Jisatsu):** Suicide by poisoning. A common literary device in tragic melodramas of this period.
*   **女郎蜘蛛 (Joro-gumo):** Literally "prostitute spider" (Nephila clavata). Used metaphorically here for a woman who lures and destroys men.
*   **肺結核 (Hai-kekkaku):** Pulmonary tuberculosis.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Downfall and Ruin:** The story follows the classic "fallen man" trope. The protagonist loses his career, his health, and his moral standing.
*   **The Seductress vs. The Saint:** A dichotomy is established between Shimizu Sayuri (the "animalistic" actress who sucks the soul out of men) and Shizue (the "holy" wife who is compared to a mother). The protagonist's tragedy is that he defiles the "holy" woman because of the corruption he brought from the "temptress."
*   **Guilt and Self-Loathing:** The narrator's tone is one of profound regret and self-deprecation ("great fool," "pathetic fly"). This fits the *buraiha* (decadent) literary style of the time.
*   **Class Displacement:** The shift from a professional athlete living in a mansion with views of Osaka Bay to a day laborer at the docks emphasizes the volatility of post-war social status.
