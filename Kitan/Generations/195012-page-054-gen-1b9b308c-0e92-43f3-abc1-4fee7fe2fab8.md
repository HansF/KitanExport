「なあ……それはお前の邪推やで。何で俺がそんな阿呆なことを――」
これで三度目の繰返しだ。間延びて抑えのないだれ声である。姉の冬乃が身をよじつたらしい音がして、
「聞かへん、誰が聞くかいなあ」
突き放した言葉の中に色気が含まれている。
「強情な女やなあ、お前の留守の間は俺が会社で泊る云うのが信用出来んか」
「……」
終んだ義兄の声に応えず、急に姉が投げた口調で太い溜息を吐いて、
「あんたの親父も気の利かん。何もこんなやゝこしい時に病気で寝んでもえゝもんを……」
「そ、そら無茶や、誰が好きで畑の中へ倒れたりするかいな。まさか中風にはならんやろが……まあ何にしても、前にはご苦労やな」
「フゝ、あんたには好都合なこつちやて……」
「又そんなこと云う。ほんまに阿呆やなあお前……五年も連れ添うて未だ俺の――」
「その気持の怖しいこと知ればこそやわ」
「へゝ……、こんな草臥れた男に誰が……ア、あいた痛いがいな秋子に聞えるでつたな……い、痛い云うのに……」

聞えるもなにもないものだ。秋子は一時間も前から続いている姉夫婦の痴話喧嘩を、慊（あき）足なしに耳へ注ぎ込まれている。うそ寒い夜の明け方に、激しく瓦を叩いて通り過ぎた驟雨の音で目覚めてから、ずっと眠れずにうとうとしていた。奥の六畳に台所の二畳、秋子の寝ている表の三畳との間には、秋も深いと云うのに破れ紙障子一枚しかなく、姉夫婦の押し殺した声が、恰も耳元に囁くように聞えるのだった。
「いやあん、あかん、あかん……て……」
姉の嬉しさを匿した声が、そして鈍い肉体のもつれる気配がした。義兄の声がその中に混り、次の瞬間不意に静かになつて了つた。
秋子は醜い程に顔をしかめて耳に掌を当てる。聴えることへの恐怖を持つている。それは抑えようとして、何事も気付かずに居ようとする努力は空しい。一切の微妙な物音や吐息を遮断した為に、却つて秋子の経験を持つ肉体の上へ、実態以上のものを幻想させ連想させる。
抑圧出来ない心の動揺は、瞑じた瞼の裏にゆらゆらと、水に写る風景のように妖しく踊り狂うのだった。描こうと意識しない苦の映像が、人間の悲しさを湛えた知性の池の面を叩き毀し、やがて弾みだした心臓の調子が乱れだす。頭髪を揺りりたい程の焦悴が、僅かの分秒の間に大きな疲労の残滓を澱ませ、得体の知れぬ情火の焔が燃え拡がり、四晩離れた良人の温みを求めて、細い血管の中をのたうち廻るのだった。それは現実と幻想との無惨な争いであり、満たされぬ女体の苦悶の図でもあつた。

**II**

晩婚であるだけに秋子は自分としては、沈着確実に熟慮の末最良の良人を選択した心算である。町の染工場に勤め、今時には珍しく夜間部（やかんぶ）に通って経済を専攻中の達夫は、三十二才なのにおでこの禿上がつた感じの弱々しい小さな顔と、薄い唇を持つた男だった。何時も何かを、それも近くを凝視するのではなく、遠い彼方をまさぐるような眼付きで、やや女性的な形の唇を一層細めて考え込む癖があつた。それが友人間に淫（いん）だと見られたが、秋子には尠く共（すくなくとも）理智性に映いた。内気な良人をリードし乍ら、ふと、その考え込む横顔に薄情で残酷な油断のならぬ翳いが、その辺りに醸され漂うのを秋子は感じ始めた。

毎日の明け暮れの中に、或る渇きが次第に二人の間に索漠とした雰囲気を作り、漸く秋子は結婚生活に対する慚愧と猜疑を持つた。何時となく二人は単に寝食を共にするだけの、他人伺同志の下宿人に近い状態に追いこまれていつた。
「――お前の眼の冷さ、言葉の刺（とげ）しさ、俺は会社に居る方がどれだけ愉しいか知れんよ。一体こりゃ何んてことだろう……」
――貴方こそ……その蛇のような眼（め）

「なあ……それはお前の邪推やで。何で俺がそんな阿呆なことを――」
これで三度目の繰り返しだ。間延びして抑えのないだれ声である。姉の冬乃が身をよじったらしい音がして、
「聞かへん、誰が聞くかいなあ」
突き放した言葉の中に色気が含まれている。
「強情な女やなあ、お前の留守の間は俺が会社に泊まるというのが信用できんか」
「……」
終わった義兄の声に応えず、急に姉が投げやりな口調で太い溜息を吐いて、
「あんたの親父も気の利かん。何もこんなややこしい時に病気で寝んでもええもんを……」
「そ、そら無茶や、誰が好きで畑の中へ倒れたりするかいな。まさか中風にはならんやろが……まあ何にしても、お前にはご苦労やな」
「ふふ、あんたには好都合なこっちゃて……」
「またそんなこと言う。ほんまに阿呆やなあお前……五年も連れ添うて未だ俺の――」
「その気持ちの恐ろしいこと知ればこそやわ」
「へへ……、こんな草臥れた男に誰が……あ、あいた、痛いがいな、秋子に聞こえるで。……つ、つな……い、痛い言うのに……」

聞こえるもなにもないものだ。秋子は一時間も前から続いている姉夫婦の痴話喧嘩を、飽き足らずに耳へ注ぎ込まれている。うそ寒い夜の明け方に、激しく瓦を叩いて通り過ぎた驟雨の音で目覚めてから、ずっと眠れずにうとうとしていた。奥の六畳に台所の二畳、秋子の寝ている表の三畳との間には、秋も深いというのに破れ紙障子一枚しかなく、姉夫婦の押し殺した声が、あたかも耳元で囁くように聞こえるのだった。
「いやあん、あかん、あかん……て……」
姉の嬉しさを隠した声が、そして鈍い肉体のもつれる気配がした。義兄の声がその中に混じり、次の瞬間不意に静かになってしまった。
秋子は醜いほどに顔をしかめて耳に手のひらを当てる。聞こえることへの恐怖を持っている。それは抑えようとして、何事も気付かずにいようとする努力は空しい。一切の微妙な物音や吐息を遮断したために、かえって秋子の経験を持つ肉体の上へ、実態以上のものを幻想させ連想させる。
抑圧できない心の動揺は、閉じた瞼の裏にゆらゆらと、水に映る風景のように妖しく踊り狂うのだった。描こうと意識しない苦の映像が、人間の悲しさを湛えた知性の池の面を叩き壊し、やがて弾みだした心臓の調子が乱れだす。頭髪をむしりたいほどの焦燥が、わずかの分秒の間に大きな疲労の残滓を澱ませ、得体の知れぬ情火の炎が燃え広がり、四晩離れた夫の温もりを求めて、細い血管の中をのたうち回るのだった。それは現実と幻想との無惨な争いであり、満たされぬ女体の苦悶の図でもあった。

**II**

晩婚であるだけに秋子は自分としては、沈着確実に熟慮の末最良の夫を選択したつもりである。町の染色工場に勤め、今時には珍しく夜間部に通って経済を専攻中の達夫は、三十二歳なのにおでこの禿げ上がった感じの弱々しい小さな顔と、薄い唇を持った男だった。いつも何かを、それも近くを凝視するのではなく、遠い彼方をまさぐるような目付きで、やや女性的な形の唇を一層細めて考え込む癖があった。それが友人間に淫だと見られたが、秋子には少なくとも理知的に映った。内気な夫をリードしながら、ふと、その考え込む横顔に薄情で残酷な油断のならない翳（かげ）りが、そのあたりに醸し出され漂うのを秋子は感じ始めた。

毎日の明け暮れの中に、ある渇きが次第に二人の間に索漠とした雰囲気を作り、ようやく秋子は結婚生活に対する慚愧と猜疑を持った。いつとなく二人は単に寝食を共にするだけの、他人同士の下宿人に近い状態に追い込まれていった。
「――お前の目の冷たさ、言葉の刺々しさ、俺は会社にいる方がどれだけ楽しいか知れんよ。一体こりゃ何てことだろう……」

**Flirting Tactics**
**Naoki Ryunosuke**
**Akita Reiko (Art)**

"Hey... that is your groundless suspicion. Why [would] I such a foolish thing [do]—"
With this, [it is] the third repetition. [It is] a long-drawn, unrestrained, slack voice. There was a sound like sister Fuyu-no twisting her body,
"I won't listen, who [would] listen [to that]?"
Inside the rebuffing words, sexiness is included.
"Stubborn woman, isn't it? [That] I stay at the company during your absence, saying that, can't [you] believe?"
"..."
Not responding to the finished brother-in-law's voice, suddenly sister with a neglected tone a heavy sigh breathed out,
"Your father also [is] tactless. Even at such a complicated time, [he] shouldn't sleep with illness..."
"Th-that's unreasonable, who likes [it] and in the middle of a field falls down? Surely [it] won't become palsy... well in any case, before [that] it's hard work for you."
"Huhu, for you it's a convenient thing..."
"Again such a thing you say. Really a fool you are... five years together and still my—"
"Knowing that feeling's fearfulness is exactly why."
"Hehe... to such a worn-out man who... Ah, ouch, it hurts, Akiko [will] hear. ...Wait... I'm saying it hurts..."

Hearing or anything, there is no such thing [it doesn't matter]. Akiko, since one hour ago continuing sister-couple's lovers' quarrel, unsatisfyingly into ears is being poured. In the slightly cold night's dawn, by the sound of a sudden rain that violently roof tiles hit and passed by having awakened, all along without being able to sleep was dozing. Between the back six-mat [room] and kitchen two-mat [room], and Akiko's sleeping front three-mat [room], although autumn is deep, there is only one torn paper screen, and the sister-couple's suppressed voices, as if at the ear-tip whispering, were heard.
"Noo, it's no good, no good... [stop]..."
Sister's happiness-hiding voice, and then dull flesh tangling sign happened. Brother-in-law's voice inside that mixed, next moment suddenly quiet became.
Akiko to an ugly extent face scowls and to ears palms applies. Hearing toward fear she has. That, trying to suppress, anything without noticing trying to stay effort is vain. Because all subtle noises and breaths were cut off, on the contrary upon Akiko's experience-having flesh, more than reality things [she] imagines and associates.
Unrepressable heart's agitation, behind closed eyelids waveringly, like in water reflected scenery eerily dances madly. Not consciously trying to draw suffering's images, humans' sadness-filled intellect's pond surface hit and break, eventually starting to bounce heart's rhythm becomes disturbed. To the extent of wanting to pluck hair impatience, in a few minutes/seconds a large fatigue's dregs settle, unidentifiable passion-fire's flame burns and spreads, seeking four-nights-away husband's warmth, inside thin blood vessels writhes around. That was reality and fantasy's cruel struggle, and unfilled female-body's agony's diagram too it was.

**II**

Being a late marriage, Akiko for herself, calmly/certainly after mature reflection best husband selected intention is. At the town's dyeing factory working, nowadays unusually night school attending and economics majoring Tatsuo, despite thirty-two years old, forehead-balded-feeling weak small face and thin lips having man was. Always something, and that nearby staring not, distant far-away groping-like eye-look with, somewhat feminine-shaped lips further narrowing brooding habit had. That among friends "lewd" was seen as, but to Akiko at least intellectually it reflected. While leading the shy husband, suddenly, in that brooding profile a heartless and cruel, not-to-be-guarded-against shadow, in that vicinity being brewed and drifting Akiko began to feel.

Inside everyday's dawn and dusk, a certain thirst gradually between two people a desolate atmosphere made, finally Akiko toward marriage life remorse and suspicion had. Without knowing when, the two simply sleeping/eating together only, stranger-fellow lodgers-close state into were pushed.
"—Your eyes' coldness, words' thorniness, I [at] the company being how much more pleasant [it is] I don't know. Just what is this thing..."
—You are the one... those snake-like eyes.

**The Distance of the Flesh**
**Tactics of Infidelity**
**By Ryunosuke Naoki**
**Illustrated by Reiko Akita**

"Come on now... that’s just your baseless suspicion. Why would I do something so stupid—"
It was the third time he had repeated himself. His voice was a drawn-out, unrestrained drone. There was a sound as if her sister, Fuyuno, was twisting her body.
"I won't listen. Who would believe a word of it?"
Despite her rebuff, there was a trace of coquetry in her voice.
"You're a stubborn woman, aren't you? Can't you trust me when I say I was staying at the office while you were away?"
"..."
Instead of answering her brother-in-law, her sister suddenly let out a heavy, dismissive sigh. 
"Your father is so tactless, too. He didn't have to go and fall ill at a complicated time like this..."
"Th-that's a bit harsh. No one falls down in the middle of a field because they want to. It’s probably not a stroke, but... well, at any rate, I know it’s been hard on you."
"Heh, I’m sure it’s quite convenient for you..."
"There you go again. You really are a fool... after five years together, you still don't—"
"It's precisely because I know how terrifying those feelings are."
"Heh... who would want a worn-out man like me... Ow! That hurts! Akiko will hear you... Wait... I said it hurts..."

Whether she could hear them or not was hardly the point. Akiko had been forced to listen to her sister and brother-in-law’s lover’s quarrel for over an hour. She had been awake since dawn, jolted from sleep by a sudden, chilling rain drumming violently against the roof tiles, and had been dozing fitfully ever since. Between the six-mat inner room, the two-mat kitchen, and the three-mat front room where Akiko slept, there was only a single torn paper screen, despite the deep autumn chill. Her sister’s muffled cries reached her as clearly as if they were being whispered directly into her ear.
"No... stop... you can't..."
Akiko heard her sister’s voice, which failed to hide her pleasure, and then the dull rustle of bodies entertwining. Her brother-in-law’s voice joined in, and then, suddenly, everything went silent.
Akiko grimaced and pressed her palms against her ears. She felt a profound dread of hearing more. Yet her efforts to suppress it and pretend she noticed nothing were in vain. Because she had blocked out the subtle sounds and breaths, her own experienced body instead began to conjure up fantasies far more vivid than reality.
The uncontrollable agitation of her heart danced wildly behind her closed eyelids, like a landscape shimmering on the surface of water. Unbidden images of suffering shattered the calm of her intellect, and soon the rhythm of her racing heart grew erratic. An impatience so sharp she wanted to tear at her hair left a residue of exhaustion in just a few moments. A strange fire of passion spread through her; she yearned for the warmth of her husband, from whom she had been apart for four nights, as it writhed through her veins. It was a brutal struggle between reality and fantasy—a portrait of the agony of an unfulfilled woman.

**II**

Because she had married late, Akiko believed she had chosen the best possible husband after careful, level-headed deliberation. Tatsuo worked at a local dyeing factory and, rare for these times, attended night school to major in economics. At thirty-two, he had a weak, small face with a receding hairline and thin lips. He had a habit of narrowing his feminine lips and brooding, his eyes never fixed on anything nearby but always seeming to grope for something in the far distance. While his friends saw this as a sign of a lewd nature, to Akiko, it appeared intellectual. But as she took the lead with her shy husband, she began to sense a cold, cruel, and dangerous shadow lurking beneath his pensive profile.

In the course of their daily lives, a certain thirst gradually created a desolate atmosphere between them. Finally, Akiko began to feel remorse and suspicion regarding her marriage. Before they knew it, the two of them had been driven into a state more like strangers sharing a boarding house, merely eating and sleeping under the same roof.
"—The coldness in your eyes, the sting in your words... you have no idea how much happier I am at the office. What on earth has happened to us?"
—*You're the one... with those snake-like eyes.*

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page uses a traditional vertical layout (*tategaki*). The title "肉体の距離" (Distance of the Flesh) is set in a large, stylized, hand-drawn font that evokes a sense of organic or bodily form, fitting the title.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and series name are prominent at the top right. The author and illustrator credits are smaller. The text is divided into two main sections, indicated by the Roman numeral "II," which marks a shift from the immediate scene to a backstory/character description.
*   **Illustration Integration:** While not fully visible on this page, the credit for Akita Reiko suggests that the story was accompanied by illustrations, typical of the "pulp" or "entertainment" magazines of the era.
*   **Column Structure:** The text flows in multiple columns from right to left. There is a clear distinction between dialogue (marked with brackets 「 」) and narrative prose.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** This style of writing and layout is characteristic of the late 1940s and early 1950s. This was the era of *kasutori* magazines—cheaply made, sensationalist publications that often focused on "ero-guro-nansen-su" (eroticism, grotesquerie, and nonsense).
*   **Post-War Living Conditions:** The description of the living arrangement—a three-mat room, a two-mat kitchen, and a six-mat room separated only by a *shoji* (paper screen)—reflects the cramped, thin-walled housing common in urban Japan after the war. The lack of privacy is a central plot point.
*   **Language & Dialect:** The dialogue uses Kansai/Osaka dialect (e.g., *aho na koto*, *akan*, *yade*), which often signaled a more "common" or "earthy" character in literature of this period.
*   **Social Roles:** The mention of the husband attending night school to study economics reflects the post-war drive for self-improvement and education as a means of social mobility.
*   **Health References:** "Chufu" (中風) refers to a stroke or palsy, a common fear in an era with less developed geriatric care.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **邪推 (Jasui):** Groundless suspicion or distrust. A key word establishing the tension in the first scene.
*   **痴話喧嘩 (Chiwa-genka):** A lover's quarrel. It implies a quarrel that is ultimately flirtatious or shallow.
*   **驟雨 (Shūu):** A sudden shower or squall. Used here to set a dark, restless mood.
*   **三畳 (San-jō):** A three-mat room (approx. 4.8 square meters). Extremely small, emphasizing the character's cramped life.
*   **慚愧 (Zanki):** Remorse, shame, or humiliation. Used to describe Akiko's feelings about her failing marriage.
*   **索漠 (Sakubaku):** Desolate, bleak, or dreary.
*   **翳り (Kageri):** A shadow or gloom. Metaphorically refers to a dark side of a person's character.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Voyeurism & Privacy:** The physical "distance" mentioned in the title is ironically small (a paper screen), yet the emotional distance is vast. Akiko's act of listening to her sister's sexual encounter highlights her own loneliness and sexual frustration.
*   **The "Mask" of Intellect:** Akiko chose her husband for his perceived "intellectualism," but she begins to see it as a mask for cruelty or emotional coldness ("snake-like eyes").
*   **Flesh vs. Spirit:** The story juxtaposes the raw, "fleshy" reality of the sister's marriage with the sterile, "intellectual" failure of Akiko's. 
*   **Post-War Malaise:** There is an underlying sense of exhaustion and "thirst" (*kawaki*), reflecting the psychological state of a population recovering from war and living in impoverished conditions.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Popular Fiction, Serialized Novel (Shōsetsu).
*   **Genre:** Romance, Melodrama, Eroticism (Mild), Pulp Fiction.
*   **Themes:** Marriage, Infidelity, Jealousy, Urban Life, Human Psychology, Loneliness.
