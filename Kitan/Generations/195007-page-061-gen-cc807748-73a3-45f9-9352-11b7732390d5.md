**今　は　昔…**

ので、一緒に京へ上ることになつた。彼の心は、京へ京へとやつた。
「俺といふ男は、何んといふ男だ。あの氣立のよい女を、何の理由もなしに棄てゝしまつた。俺は京へ着いたら直ぐ捨てゝ来た妻を訪ねて、又もとの妻にしよう」
　彼は自分の心に固く誓つた。京へ着くやいなや、その足でもとの妻の家を訪ねた。
　それは、前見た頃とはまるで違つて、すつかり荒れ朽ちてしまつていた。草はぼうぼうと足の踏み場もない位に生い茂つて、人の住んでいる氣配さえもないほどの荒れ様だつた。
　彼はこの有様を見て、いよ〜物悲しく自責の念にかられて心が痛かつた。
　九月十日頃の事であつたので、月は明るかつた。草の葉に置いた露も冷々と彼の着物の裾を濡らした。扉を開いてつか〜と入つて見ると、何時も彼女がいた所に、今は只一人でしよんぼりと坐つていた。
　入つて来た彼を見ると、少しも怨むような色も見せず、さも嬉しそうにして言つた。
「まあ、あなた、今日此方へお戻りになりましたの、あたし淋しかつたわ」
　男は、遠國へ行つていた間、自分の抱いていた心持を語つた。
「任地から持つて帰つた物も今日明日のうちに此処へ取り寄せよう、従者も呼ぼう、今夜は只此の事を話そうと思つて、眞ツ先にやつて来たのだ」
　彼女は、彼の言葉に喜んで今迄別れていた永い間の悲しかつた生活等を語り合つている中に夜も更けてしまつたので、ではもう寝ることにしようと、二人は厚く手を携えて南向きの部屋へ移つた。
「ここには、外に誰もいないのか」
「はい、人らしい暮しも出来ませんでしたので、召使など一にもございません」
　二人は終夜語り明かして、しら〜と夜の明け初める頃になつてようやく寝入つた。

　やがて夜が明けた。
　男は眼をさました。朝日はきら〜と部屋の中にならしていた。
「あゝ、よく眠むつた。」
　伸びをしながら、添臥した妻を見て、あツと仰天して、彼は衣を抱えたまゝ、下へ飛び下りた。それは可愛かつたもとの妻ではなくて、るい〜たる白骨の屍であつた。
　彼はあわてゝ水平袴を着て走り出ると、隣家へ駆け込み、何に知らぬ顔をして訊ねた。
「このお隣りの人は今何処におりますか」
「おゝ、お隣りの人ですか、何んでも、女が一人居りましたが、四五年通つていた夫奴が薄情にも棄てゝ何処かへ行つてしまつたので、敷き悲しみ、とう〜病氣になつてしまいましたが、誰一人介抱する人もないので、此の夏死んでしまいました。葬式を出す人もないので、そのまま屍体は残つているでしょう」
　何も知らぬ人は、こう話してくれた。

**〔第四話〕**
**尼僧の淫念**

　今は昔。京の東山に長樂寺というお寺があつて、そこに佛道を修行する一人の年若い坊さんがあつた。
　或る時、彼は花を採つて、佛に奉ろうと、山の奥深く辿つて入り、山々谷々をめぐつている間に日が落ちてしまつたので、仕方がないので樹の下に宿つた。
　日がすつかり暮れて、あたりが、静かになると、自分の近くで細くかすかに、いともあでやかな法華経を誦する聲がした。
「おや？」と彼は不審に思いながらも、知らず知らず、夜通しその讀經の聲を聞きすました。
　やがて夜が明けかけた。
　彼は聲のする方へと辿つて近づいて行つた。そしてその直ぐ近くまで着いた時、地面より少し高いものが、ぼんやりと黒く見えた。
「何んだろうか？」
と、尚もよく見ているうちに、夜はすつかりと明けはなれた。それは苔むして蔓草が一杯まとつている一個の岩であつた。
「一体、お經を誦しているのは何方だろう、若しかするとこの岩に仙人がいて讀經しているのかも知れない」
　こう思うと、岩そのものが、何とはなしに崇厳に見えて来たので、彼は足を止めて、じつとその岩を見守つていた。
　や〜暫くそゞ岩を見つめていると、急に自らグラ〜と動き出して、だん〜高くなり見る間に人の形となつて走り出した。
　見ればそれは齢六十ばかりの老尼であつた。
　蔓草はみなブツ〜に切れて終つていた。年若い坊さんは愕然としながらも
「どうした事です？」
がした。

**今は昔…**

ので、一緒に京へ上ることになった。彼の心は、京へ京へと急いだ。
「俺という男は、なんという男だ。あの気立ての良い女を、何の理由もなしに捨ててしまった。俺は京に着いたらすぐに捨ててきた妻を訪ねて、また元の妻にしよう」
　彼は自分の心に固く誓った。京に着くやいなや、その足で元の妻の家を訪ねた。
　そこは、以前見た頃とはまるで違って、すっかり荒れ果てていた。草はぼうぼうと足の踏み場もないほどに生い茂って、人の住んでいる気配さえないほどの荒れ様だった。
　彼はこの有様を見て、いよいよ物悲しく自責の念に駆られて心が痛かった。
　九月十日頃のことであったので、月は明るかった。草の葉に置いた露も冷ややかに彼の着物の裾を濡らした。扉を開いてつかつかと入ってみると、いつも彼女がいた所に、今はただ一人でしんみりと座っていた。
　入ってきた彼を見ると、少しも恨むような色も見せず、いかにも嬉しそうにして言った。
「まあ、あなた、今日こちらへお戻りになりましたの。あたし寂しかったわ」
　男は、遠国へ行っていた間、自分が抱いていた気持ちを語った。
「任地から持ってきた物も今日明日のうちにここへ取り寄せよう。従者も呼ぼう。今夜はただこのことを話そうと思って、真っ先にやって来たのだ」
　彼女は彼の言葉に喜んで、これまで別れていた長い間の悲しかった生活などを語り合っているうちに夜も更けてしまったので、「ではもう寝ることにしよう」と、二人は手を取り合って南向きの部屋へ移った。
「ここには、外に誰もいないのか」
「はい、人らしい暮らしもできませんでしたので、召使いなど一人もございません」
　二人は夜通し語り明かして、白々と夜が明け始める頃になってようやく寝入った。

　やがて夜が明けた。
　男は目を覚ました。朝日はきらきらと部屋の中に差し込んでいた。
「あぁ、よく眠った」
　伸びをしながら、隣に寝ていた妻を見て、あっと仰天して、彼は衣を抱えたまま下に飛び降りた。それは可愛かった元の妻ではなくて、累々たる白骨の死体であった。
　彼は慌てて袴を着て走り出ると、隣家へ駆け込み、何食わぬ顔をして尋ねた。
「このお隣の人は今どこにおりますか」
「おぉ、お隣の人ですか。なんでも、女が一人おりましたが、四、五年通っていた夫が薄情にも捨ててどこかへ行ってしまったので、ひどく悲しみ、とうとう病気になってしまいましたが、誰一人介抱する人もないので、この夏死んでしまいました。葬式を出す人もないので、そのまま死体は残っているでしょう」

　日がすっかり暮れて、あたりが静かになると、自分の近くで細くかすかに、いとも艶やかな法華経を誦する声がした。
「おや？」と彼は不審に思いながらも、知らず知らず、夜通しその読経の声に聞き入った。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Now is past...** (Once upon a time...)

...therefore, [he] decided to go up to Kyoto together. His heart went to Kyoto, to Kyoto.
"What kind of man am I? That good-natured woman, for no reason, I abandoned [her] completely. When I arrive in Kyoto, I will immediately visit the wife I abandoned and make her my wife again."
He firmly vowed in his own heart. As soon as he arrived in Kyoto, on those feet (immediately), he visited the house of his former wife.
That place, compared to the time he saw it before, was completely different, entirely ruined and decayed. Grass was overgrown to the point there was no place for feet to step, a state of ruin so much that there was not even a hint of a person living there.
He saw this condition, more and more felt sorrow and self-reproach, and his heart pained.
Because it was around the 10th day of September, the moon was bright. Dew placed on grass leaves coldly wet the hem of his kimono. Opening the door and entering briskly to see, in the place where she always was, now just one person was sitting dejectedly.
Seeing him who had entered, she did not show even a bit of a resentful color, and spoke looking very happy.
"Oh, you, today did you return to this direction? I was lonely."
The man, during the time he was in a far country, spoke of the feelings he had held.
"The things I brought back from my post, within today or tomorrow I will have brought here. I will call servants too. Tonight I thought to just talk of this, so I came first thing."
She was happy at his words, and while they talked together of the sad life during the long time they were separated until now, the night deepened, so "Then, let's go to sleep," and the two holding hands moved to the south-facing room.
"In here, is there no one else?"
"Yes, because I could not even have a human-like life, there is not even one servant."
The two talked through the night until dawn, and around the time when the night began to dawn whitely, they finally fell asleep.

Eventually, the night dawned.
The man woke his eyes. The morning sun was sparkling into the room.
"Ah, I slept well."
While stretching, looking at the wife lying beside him, with a "Ah!" of shock, he, while holding his clothes, jumped down. It was not the cute former wife, but was the remains of a white skeleton piled up.
He in a hurry put on his hakama and ran out, ran into the neighbor's house, and with a face knowing nothing, asked:
"The person in this next door, where is she now?"
"Oh, the next door person? Whatever it was, one woman lived there, but the husband who had been visiting for four or five years heartlessly abandoned her and went somewhere, so she grieved deeply, and finally became sick, but since there was not even one person to nurse her, she died this summer. Since there is no person to perform a funeral, the corpse likely remains as it is."
The person who knew nothing spoke thus to him.

**[Fourth Tale]**
**The Nun's Lustful Obsession**

Now is past. In Kyoto's Higashiyama, there was a temple called Chorakuji, and there was one young monk practicing the Buddha way.
One time, he picked flowers, intending to offer them to Buddha, and traced deep into the mountains, and while wandering through mountains and valleys, the sun fell, so because there was no choice, he stayed under a tree.
The sun completely set, and when the surroundings became quiet, near himself, thinly and faintly, there was a voice reciting the Lotus Sutra very elegantly.
"Oh?" he thought suspiciously, but without knowing it, all through the night he listened intently to that voice of sutra-reading.
Eventually, the night began to dawn.
He traced toward the direction of the voice and approached. And when he arrived very near, something slightly higher than the ground looked vaguely black.
"What could it be?"
and, while still looking well, the night completely dawned. It was a single rock covered in moss and with vines fully wound around it.
"Really, who is reciting the sutra? Perhaps in this rock an immortal is and is reading the sutra."
Thinking this, the rock itself came to look solemn for some reason, so he stopped his feet and watched that rock intently.
And, after staring at the rock for a while, suddenly of its own accord it began to move "gura-gura" (shaking), became gradually tall, and while watching, became a human shape and began to run.
Looking, it was an old nun of about sixty years of age.
The vines were all cut into "butsu-butsu" (snapped pieces). The young monk, while being aghast, said:
"What has happened?"

**Tales of Times Now Past**

...And so, they decided to travel up to the capital together. His heart, however, raced ahead to Kyoto.
"What a fool I have been," he thought. "To have abandoned such a good-natured woman for no reason at all. As soon as I reach the capital, I shall go to her and take her back as my wife once more."
He made a solemn vow to himself. No sooner had he set foot in Kyoto than he hurried straight to her house.
But the home he found was a world away from the one he remembered. It was utterly dilapidated, a crumbling ruin. Weeds grew so thick and wild there was nowhere even to step; the place looked so desolate that one could not imagine a living soul dwelt within.
The sight filled him with an overwhelming melancholy, and his heart ached with the sharp sting of remorse.
It was around the tenth day of the ninth month, and the moon shone brightly. The dew upon the tall grass chilled the hem of his robes as he brushed past. He pushed open the door and stepped inside. There, in the very spot she had always sat, he found her—sitting all alone, looking small and forlorn.
When she looked up and saw him, she showed not a trace of resentment. Instead, her face lit up with joy.
"Oh, my dear," she said. "You have come back to me at last. I have been so very lonely."
The man spoke of all that had been in his heart during the long years he spent in the distant provinces.
"I shall have my belongings brought from my post tomorrow," he promised. "I will bring servants as well. But tonight, I wanted only to talk with you, so I came here before all else."
She was overjoyed by his words. As they sat together, sharing stories of the long, sorrowful years they had spent apart, the night grew deep. Finally, they decided to retire, and hand in hand, they moved to the south-facing room.
"Is there no one else living here?" he asked.
"No," she replied. "I could no longer afford to live a proper life, so there is not a single servant left."
The two talked the whole night through until the first pale light of dawn began to touch the sky, at which point they finally drifted off to sleep.

When the sun finally rose, the man awoke to find the room bathed in sparkling light.
"Ah, what a long sleep," he murmured.
He stretched and turned toward his wife lying beside him. With a gasp of pure terror, he scrambled away, clutching his clothes. It was not his beloved wife who lay there, but a heap of dry, white bones.
Panic-stricken, he threw on his robes and fled the house. He ran to the neighbor’s home and, pretending he knew nothing of the situation, asked:
"Pray, tell me, where is the woman who lived next door?"
"Oh, that poor soul?" the neighbor replied. "Well, she lived there alone after her husband of many years heartlessly abandoned her. She was so consumed by grief that she fell ill, and with no one to care for her, she passed away this very summer. Since there was no one to bury her, I suppose her body is still lying there just as it was."

**[The Fourth Tale]**
**The Nun’s Obsession**

Once upon a time, at a temple called Chorakuji in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, there lived a young monk dedicated to his Buddhist studies.
One day, he went deep into the mountains to gather flowers to offer to the Buddha. He wandered through so many hills and valleys that he lost track of time; when the sun went down, he had no choice but to spend the night under a tree.
Once darkness fell and the woods grew silent, he heard a voice nearby—faint and thin, yet incredibly elegant—reciting the Lotus Sutra.
"How strange," he thought. Yet, almost in a trance, he sat and listened to the voice chanting all through the night.
As dawn began to break, he followed the sound. When he grew close, he saw something dark and low rising from the ground.
"What could that be?" he wondered.
As the light increased, he saw that it was merely a large rock, covered in thick moss and tangled vines.
"Who could be chanting? Perhaps a mountain immortal dwells within this stone," he thought.
Filled with a sense of awe, the rock now seemed sacred to him. He stopped and watched it intently.
Suddenly, after he had been staring for some time, the rock began to lurch and shake. It grew taller and taller before his very eyes until it took the shape of a human being and began to run.
It was an old nun, perhaps sixty years of age. The vines that had bound her were snapped into a thousand pieces. The young monk, frozen in shock, managed to cry out:
"What is the meaning of this?"

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Source Material:** The first story is a retelling of a famous tale from the *Konjaku Monogatarishū* (Book 27, Tale 24). It is famously known in the West via Lafcadio Hearn’s adaptation titled "The Reconciliation" in his book *Shadowings* (1900), and was the basis for the "Black Hair" segment in Masaki Kobayashi’s 1964 film *Kwaidan*.
*   **The "Ima wa Mukashi" Trope:** The title translates to "Now it is the past," which is the standardized opening for nearly every story in the *Konjaku Monogatarishū*. It functions similarly to "Once upon a time."
*   **Historical Setting:** The stories are set in the Heian period (794–1185). The first story highlights the precarious social position of women who relied on "visiting husbands." If a man stopped visiting, the woman often fell into poverty or death.
*   **Chorakuji Temple:** A real temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district, famous for its connections to the *Heike Monogatari*.
*   **The Rock/Nun Story:** This is a classic *Setsuwa* motif where a strong obsession (*shūjaku*) or religious devotion causes a person to physically transform or remain in the world as a spirit/object.

*   **しよんぼり (Shonbori):** Dejectedly, being solitary and sad.
*   **遠國 (Engoku):** Distant provinces/lands. In the Heian period, being sent to a distant province for work was considered a form of exile from the cultured life of Kyoto.
*   **累々たる (Ruirui-taru):** Piled up; used here to describe the scattered or heaped bones of the corpse.
*   **水平袴 (Hira-bakama):** A type of pleated trousers worn by the nobility and samurai for everyday or semi-formal use.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Impermanence (Mujo):** A core Buddhist theme. The beautiful wife is revealed to be a skeleton, reminding the reader that physical beauty and life itself are fleeting.
*   **Guilt and Retribution:** The man’s attempt to fix his past mistake comes too late. The supernatural reunion serves as a psychological manifestation of his guilt.
*   **Religious Devotion vs. Physical Form:** In the second story, the nun has become so absorbed in the Lotus Sutra that her body has become stone-like, or she has haunted a stone. It explores the boundary between the human spirit and the natural/divine world.
*   **The Horrors of Desertion:** The first story acts as a cautionary tale against "fickleness" (*uwaki*) and the abandonment of one's duties to a spouse.
