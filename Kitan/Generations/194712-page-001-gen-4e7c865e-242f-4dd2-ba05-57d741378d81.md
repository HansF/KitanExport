（女の肉體美）
私わ、大學在學中、映畫のロケで某地方
の温泉街に滞在しました。
そこの旅館の女中さんに、二十二三の、
ひどく色白で、すらりとした體軀の人が
居りました。名を靜子と云ひました。
私わ、彼女に多少の好意を感じ、暇な時
わいつも誘って町を散策しました。靜子
わ、あまり口数多くなく、いつも伏し目
がちで、しおらしく、それでゐてどこか
しら妖しい色氣を漂わせてゐました。
あ〔?〕日、私は思ひ切つて靜子に「一晩
を私にくれ給へ」と申し入れました。
靜子わ、顔を赤らめましたが、直ぐに
うなづきました。
その夜、私は靜子の着物を脱がせました。
湯上りの靜子の肉體は、全く驚く程の
美しさでした。雪のやうな白さ。胸の
張り具合、腰のくびれ、丸みを帯びた
太股。今まで見てきたどんな繪畫や彫刻
にも優る、完璧な、生きた肉體美でし
た。
私わ、只ひたすらにその肉體を鑑賞し、
そして抱擁しました。

## Literal English Translation

(The Nude Beauty of a Woman)
While I was enrolled in university, I stayed in a certain regional
hot spring town for a movie location shoot.
Among the maids at the inn there, was a woman of twenty-two or three,
extremely fair-skinned, and having a slender physique.
Her name was Shizuko.
I felt a certain degree of affection for her, and when I had free time
I always invited her to walk around the town. Shizuko
was not very talkative, usually kept her eyes cast down,
was demure (shiorashiku), yet somehow
she drifted a mysterious sensuality.
One day, I bracingly proposed to Shizuko, "Grant
me one night."
Shizuko blushed, but immediately
nodded.
That night, I undressed Shizuko.
Shizuko's body, fresh from the bath, was an absolute
astonishing beauty. Snow-like whiteness. The fullness
of her breasts, the curve of her waist, her rounded
thighs. It was a perfect, living nude beauty,
surpassing any painting or sculpture
I had ever seen.
I purely and sincerely admired that body,
and then embraced it.
(Tokyo, Matsuoka, 32 years old)

## Literary English Translation

(Female Corporeal Beauty)
During my university enrollment, I traveled to a provincial hot spring resort for a film location assignment.
Among the maids at the local inn was a woman of about twenty-two or twenty-three, remarkably fair of skin and possessing a lithe, graceful figure. Her name was Shizuko.
I felt a nascent affection for her, and in my leisure time, I often invited her to stroll through the town. Shizuko was not verbose; she typically kept her gaze lowered, appearing modest and demure. Yet, beneath that surface, she emanated a mysterious, almost illicit sensuality.
One day, I worked up the courage and declared to Shizuko: "Grant me one night."
Shizuko blushed deeply but immediately gave her assent.
That evening, I removed Shizuko's kimono.
Her body, fresh from the hot spring, possessed a beauty that was truly startling. Its whiteness, like snow. The tautness of her bosom, the curve of her waist, her plump, rounded thighs. It was a perfect, living corporeal beauty, superior to any masterpiece of painting or sculpture I had ever witnessed.
I dedicated myself entirely to the purely aesthetic contemplation of that flesh, and thereafter, I embraced her.
(Tokyo – Matsuoka, Age 32)

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Submission / Sexual Confession (性体験記). This genre relies on the authenticity implied by using a non-professional name/location.
*   **Author Attribution:** Pseudonymous (Matsuoka from Tokyo, 32 years old). The urban origin and explicit age lend an air of credibility/realism typical of *Kitan Club*'s reader features.
*   **Narrator Voice:** First-person (私), educated (大学在学中 - university student), highly aesthetic, and clinical. The narrator positions the sexual act as a moment of artistic critique and appreciation (鑑賞).
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Highly appealing to educated, urban male readership interested in the blending of high art/aesthetics (sculpture, painting) with exploitative sexual encounters involving lower-class, regional women.
*   **Positioning within the magazine:** Likely part of a running feature showcasing readers' exotic or transgressive sexual adventures outside the conventional urban environment, emphasizing the pursuit of "pure" physical beauty.

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **University Student Status (大學在學中):** In mid-Showa Japan, being a university student conferred significant social status and future economic power, contrasting sharply with the status of a regional inn maid (女中).
*   **The *Jochū* (女中):** The maid was historically highly susceptible to exploitation. Her role required obedience and service, making refusal difficult, especially when faced with the demands of a high-status guest. The context strongly implies a transactional or compulsory encounter rather than a consensual romance.
*   ***Shiorashii* (しおらしい) vs. *Ayashii Iroke* (妖しい色氣):** The simultaneous description of Shizuko as demure (shiorashii) and possessing mysterious sensuality (ayashii iroke) is a classic erotic fetish—the hidden, dangerous sexuality lurking beneath an exterior of innocence or modesty.
*   **The Proposal (くれ給へ):** The use of the archaic imperative *kure tamae* is a stylistic choice. While politely phrased, the underlying meaning remains a non-negotiable demand, reflecting the power dynamic. It romanticizes or elevates the crude proposal into a dramatic declaration.
*   **Aesthetic Gaze and Objectification:** The comparison of the woman’s naked body to painting and sculpture is a deliberate rhetorical device borrowed from modern Western aestheticism (the "nude") but applied here to sanitize and justify the exploitative nature of the sexual encounter by framing it as pure artistic "admiration" (鑑賞). This intellectualization of the sexual act is hallmark of the ero-guro style.

## Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

| Term (JP) | Original Kana | Modern JP | Literal Meaning | Semantic Nuance / Euphemism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ロケ** | ロケ | ロケ | Location (shoot) | Modern, borrowed abbreviation, signaling connection to film/modern media industry. |
| **體軀** | たいくつ | 体躯 | Physique | Formal, clinical description of body structure. |
| **しおらしく** | しをらしく | 控えめに | Demurely, Meekly | Often implies a desirable, passive female character trait, contrasting with assertive sexuality. |
| **妖しい色氣** | あやしいいろけ | 妖しい色気 | Mysterious sensuality | Implies hidden, perhaps dangerous or magical sexual attractiveness. Key ero-guro vocabulary. |
| **くれ給へ** | くれたまへ | くれ給え | Grant me (formal imperative) | High register, dramatic phrasing for a base request ("Give me sex"). |
| **肉體美** | にくたいび | 肉体美 | Corporeal Beauty / Nude Beauty | Term used specifically to aestheticize the naked human form; highly objectifying. |
| **鑑賞** | かんしゃう | 鑑賞 | Appreciation (of art) | Used here to describe viewing the woman's body, explicitly positioning the body as an object of high culture study. |
| **抱擁** | ほうよう | 抱擁 | Embrace / Hugging | Euphemistic close for the sexual act; maintains the polite/aesthetic tone. |

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Aesthetic Superiority:** The educated male narrator asserts his superior taste by declaring the maid's body "perfect" and superior to traditional Western art forms (painting, sculpture), implying his own discernment is the ultimate validation of her beauty.
*   **Control and Possession:** The demand "Grant me one night" followed by the narrator removing her clothes (私は靜子の着物を脱がせました) establishes immediate dominance and control over the woman's body and agency.
*   **The Eroticization of Submissiveness:** Shizuko's lack of resistance, her blushing, and her immediate silent consent (うなづきました) are integral to the erotic fantasy presented: the easy conquest of the meek, pure, but secretly sensual low-status woman.
*   **Idealized Femininity:** The focus on "snow-like whiteness" (雪のやうな白さ), curved waist (くびれ), and rounded thighs (太股) fulfills the mid-century Japanese aesthetic ideal of feminine beauty as pure, soft, and curvilinear—a stark contrast to the harsher realities of her life as a servant.
