じめているお客か。ピシリ・ピシリ肉をうつ音。きしむ音。何か殺気のようなものを感じたが、ほどよく酔いがまわつてきている私には、むしろ猟奇的な慾望の方が、頭をもたげてくるのであつた。
私は、つきあたりの部屋の障子をあけて、腰をかけ、彼女は私の前に立つて溜息をついた。
「部屋はあいているけど、ほかに女はいないじゃないか。」
「しばらく、まつていてよ。誰にしようか、いま考えているのよ。」
「待てるもんか。キミはどうだい。」
「わたしはダメよ。」
彼女は急に聲を落した。
「内しょよ、ね。」
そういつて、彼女は、つばきのつぼみのような唇を、そつともつてきた。甘つたるい匂い、私はぐつと抱きしめて、それをゆつくり受けてやつた。もうこれでよいと思つた。これ以上は、駄足だつた。
「帰るよ。」
私は、百円札を二枚、彼女の手に、にぎらせた。彼女は、私の耳に唇を持つてきて、コマクをくすぐるのだつた。火のように燃えている彼女の肉体を意識した。
「ううん、よいとも。」
私が立ちかけると、いきなり彼女は、はげしく憤りながら、私の肩をぶちはじめた。
「あんた、なんだい。こんなところまできてひやかしむかい。さつさと帰りやがれ、さあさまでごなしないで早く出て行け。」
金切聲を出して、果ては私を突き出すのだ。ポン引きである彼女と私のヤミ取引は、絶対に許されない戒律の一つだつた。そうして、彼女にこすかれ、押されて道路へ出た。彼女は、そこではじめてクスリと笑つた。
「すみません。悪く思わないでね。」
そうささやいた。彼女の良心であつた。私は妙に愉快になつた。私はひとりの味方を得たような気がして、そのまま別れてしまうには、おしい夜であると思つた。もつと突込んで見るかな。私は、彼女の手をそつととつてにぎりしめた。
「ねえ、もう少しいつきあわないかい。」
「そうサボつてばかりいられないわ。見つかつたらやかましいの。」
「だつたらね、ガードの下でもう一度新しいお客として、会うことにしようじゃないか。」
彼女はうなずいた。舗道が凍てついて、カッカッと鳴つた。彼女はズボンのポケットに手を入れたまま、走り出した。白タビに下駄が印象的であつた。
「どうぞしやしやろ、いい娘いまつせ。」
目白押しに路上に立つているのは、これぞ大阪の大玄関情痴梅田の関をあずかるポン引きばかりであつたが、私はそれをふり切つて、見事関所破りに成功、まつすぐガード下に行つて彼女を待つていた。すぐ彼女は現れた。私は彼女のゴムまりのような腰を抱くようにしてガードを抜け、ガード横の暗い

じめているお客か。ピシリ・ピシリ肉を打つ音。きしむ音。何か殺気のようなものを感じたが、ほどよく酔いが回ってきている私には、むしろ猟奇的な欲望の方が、頭をもたげてくるのであった。
私は、突き当たりの部屋の障子を開けて腰をかけ、彼女は私の前に立って溜息をついた。
「部屋は空いているけど、他に女はいないじゃないか。」
「しばらく待っていてよ。誰にしようか、今考えているのよ。」
「待てるもんか。キミはどうだい。」
「私はダメよ。」
彼女は急に声を落とした。
「内緒よ、ね。」
そう言って、彼女は、椿の蕾のような唇を、そっと持ってきた。甘ったるい匂い、私はぐっと抱きしめて、それをゆっくり受けてやった。もうこれで良いと思った。これ以上は、蛇足だった。
「帰るよ。」
私は、百円札を二枚、彼女の手に握らせた。彼女は、私の耳に唇を持ってきて、鼓膜をくすぐるのであった。火のように燃えている彼女の肉体を意識した。
「ううん、良いとも。」
私が立ちかけると、いきなり彼女は、激しく憤りながら、私の肩を打ち始めた。
「あんた、何だい。こんなところまで来て冷やかしかい。さっさと帰りやがれ、さあさ、までごなし（？）しないで早く出て行け。」
金切声を出して、果ては私を突き出すのだ。ポン引きである彼女と私の闇取引は、絶対に許されない戒律の一つだった。そうして、彼女にこずかれ、押されて道路へ出た。彼女は、そこで初めてクスリと笑った。
「すみません。悪く思わないでね。」
そう囁いた。彼女の良心であった。私は妙に愉快になった。私は一人の味方を得たような気がして、そのまま別れてしまうには、惜しい夜であると思った。もっと突っ込んでみるかな。私は、彼女の手をそっと取って握りしめた。
「ねえ、もう少し付き合わないかい。」
「そうサボってばかりいられないわ。見つかったら喧しいの。」
「だったらね、ガードの下でもう一度新しい客として、会うことにしようじゃないか。」
彼女は頷いた。舗道が凍てついて、カッカッと鳴った。彼女はズボンのポケットに手を入れたまま、走り出した。白足袋に下駄が印象的であった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The customers are beginning? *Pishiri, pishiri*, the sound of striking flesh. A creaking sound. Something like bloodlust I felt, but to me, who had become moderately drunk, rather a bizarre desire was raising its head.
I, opening the shoji of the room at the end, sat down; she stood before me and breathed a sigh.
"The room is open, but there are no other women, are there?"
"Wait for a while. Who shall I pick, I am thinking now."
"I can't wait. How about you?"
"I am no good."
She suddenly dropped her voice.
"It's a secret, okay?"
Saying so, she, lips like a camellia bud, softly brought them near. A sugary smell; I firmly embraced her and slowly received it. Already with this it is good, I thought. Anything more was a redundancy.
"I'm going home."
I, two 100-yen notes, into her hand, made her grasp. She, bringing her lips to my ear, tickled my eardrum. Like fire burning, I was conscious of her body.
"Yeah, it's fine."
When I started to stand, suddenly she, while fiercely being indignant, began to strike my shoulder.
"You, what are you? Coming to a place like this just to window-shop? Hurry up and get the hell home! Come on, don't dally and get out quickly!"
Making a shrill voice, finally she pushed me out. A secret transaction between her, who is a tout (pimp), and me was one of the absolutely forbidden commandments. Thus, nudged and pushed by her, I went out to the road. She, there for the first time, giggled.
"I'm sorry. Don't think badly of me."
So she whispered. It was her conscience. I became strangely cheerful. I felt like I had gained one ally, and thought it was a regrettable night to just part like that. Shall I try going deeper? I softly took her hand and squeezed it.
"Hey, won't you hang out a bit more?"
"I can't just keep slacking off. If I'm found, they'll be noisy."
"Then, under the railway guard (overpass), let's meet once more as a new customer."
She nodded. The pavement was frozen and rang *kakka*. She, with hands in her pants pockets, started running. White tabi with geta (sandals) were impressive.
"Please, step right up, there's a good girl here."
Standing cheek-by-jowl on the road were nothing but the touts who manage the "Gate of Umeda," the grand entrance of Osaka's lust, but I shook them off, successfully broke through the "checkpoint," and went straight under the guard to wait for her. Soon she appeared. I, as if embracing her rubber-ball-like waist, passed through the guard, and the dark side of the guard...

Scene 2, Section 1
That night,
Fujiwara's room (Like an apartment, in a corner of the room a bookshelf, a desk is next to it; on one side Fujiwara's Western clothes and Ayako's kimono etc. are hanging.
Fujiwara is lying down reading a newspaper.)
(Wife Ayako, at a low table where dishes etc. are still scattered, is resting her elbows with a sulking face.)
Ayako: "Hey, dear. I have something to tell you today."
Fujiwara: (Staying silent)
Ayako: "Dear, I really have something I want to ask today."
...The wind is strong so I thought maybe things would fly away, and the neighbor's wife is too much.
(Because the wind direction changed, near Kawamura's shirt, Ayako's *koshimaki* (waist-wrap) is fluttering)
Matsuko: "Ah, how frustrating! Drying my own *koshimaki* right next to someone else's husband's shirt... I have to be careful of that wife. Even my husband is saying the neighbor's wife looks good in Western clothes."
(Runs to the drying area, pushes Fujiwara's laundry to one side. *Pe-pe*, spits on it.)
(Taking in only her own laundry, she quickly goes down.)

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Was it another customer starting? I heard the *thwack-thwack* of flesh hitting flesh, accompanied by a low creaking. I sensed a murderous tension in the air, but for me, comfortably numbed by drink, it only served to awaken a dark, twisted desire. 
I opened the shoji at the end of the hall and sat down. She stood before me and let out a heavy sigh.
"The room is free, but I don't see any other girls around," I said.
"Just wait a moment. I'm trying to think of who to get for you."
"I’m not in a waiting mood. How about you?"
"Not me," she whispered, her voice suddenly dropping. "It’s a secret, alright?"
With that, she pressed her lips—tight and soft like a camellia bud—against mine. She smelled cloyingly sweet. I pulled her into a firm embrace and lingered in the moment. This was enough, I thought. Anything more would have been overkill.
"I'm leaving," I said.
I pressed two hundred-yen notes into her palm. She leaned in, her lips brushing my ear, her breath tickling my eardrum. I was acutely aware of her body, burning hot as a flame.
"Yeah, that's fine."
But as I made to stand, she suddenly flared up in a mock rage, hammering at my shoulders.
"What do you think you're doing? You come to a place like this just to tease? Get the hell out! Go on, stop wasting time and beat it!"
She shrieked, making a scene as she shoved me out the door. In the world we inhabited, a private deal between a customer and a street tout like her was a cardinal sin. Harried and pushed, I stumbled out onto the street. It was only then that she let out a little giggle.
"Sorry about that. Don't take it personally," she whispered.
It was a flash of genuine conscience. I felt a strange surge of high spirits, as if I’d found a lone ally in the city. It seemed a waste to let the night end here. *Maybe I’ll push my luck,* I thought. I reached out and squeezed her hand.
"Hey, stay with me a little longer."
"I can't keep skipping out on work. There'll be hell to pay if I'm caught."
"Then let's do this: I'll meet you under the railway tracks, and we'll start over as if I’m a brand-new customer."
She nodded. The frozen pavement rang out sharply under our feet. She took off running, hands stuffed in her trouser pockets. The sight of her white *tabi* socks paired with wooden *geta* sandals left a vivid impression on me.
"Step right up! Got a real beauty for you here!"
The street was swarming with touts, the gatekeepers of Umeda—that great, lustful entrance to Osaka. I pushed past them like a man running a blockade and headed straight for the tracks to wait for her. She appeared a moment later. I pulled her toward me, her waist firm as a rubber ball, and we slipped into the shadows beside the tracks...

**Scene 2**
Later that night, in Fujiwara’s room. It’s a typical apartment; a bookshelf stands in the corner with a desk beside it. Fujiwara’s Western suits and his wife Ayako’s kimonos hang on the wall. Fujiwara is sprawled out, buried in a newspaper. Ayako sits at the low table, which is still cluttered with dirty dishes, her face a mask of resentment.
Ayako: "Hey. I have something to say to you."
Fujiwara: (Silent)
Ayako: "I mean it. There’s something I need to ask you today."
[Scene shifts to the laundry area]
"The wind is so strong I was worried things might blow away, but that woman next door is really too much!" 
The wind has shifted, blowing Ayako’s *koshimaki* undergarment right up against Mr. Kawamura’s shirt.
Matsuko: "God, this is infuriating! Drying my own underwear right next to another man’s shirt... I have to keep an eye on that woman. Even my husband is going on about how good she looks in Western dresses."
She rushes to the drying rack, shoves Fujiwara’s laundry aside, and spits on it in spite. Then, grabbing only her own things, she hurries away.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Structure:** The page is divided into two distinct parts. The top and middle sections contain a prose narrative (a short story or novel excerpt). The bottom section, marked "二 一景" (Scene 2/Chapter 2), appears to be a script or a play-like dramatization of a domestic scene.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a standard vertical layout (tategaki). The font is a traditional Mincho style. The use of small furigana or specific punctuation marks like the iteration mark (＼／) for "hira hira" (fluttering) is characteristic of mid-century printing.
*   **Illustration:** The line drawing in the center depicts a man in a Western suit and a woman with a permed hairstyle, typical of the "modern" look of the late 1940s and 1950s. Their expressions are somewhat hardened or weary, fitting the gritty urban theme.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title or header is missing from this specific crop, but the narrative starts with an indented paragraph. The "Scene 2" section is clearly demarcated by a horizontal line and a sub-heading.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** This text is a prime example of "Kasutori" literature—cheap, sensationalist magazines that flourished in the devastation of post-war Japan. They often focused on the "Three S’s": Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports, reflecting the "dregs" (kasutori) of society.
*   **Umeda (Osaka):** Mentioned as the "Grand Entrance" (Daikankan). Post-war Umeda was famous for its massive black markets and "blue line" (illegal/semi-legal prostitution) districts. 
*   **Pon-biki (ポン引き):** These were touts or pimps who lured men into back-alley brothels or "special tea houses." In the story, the woman is acting as a tout but engages in a "dark transaction" (yamitoriki) by essentially "selling herself" directly, which bypasses the house/pimp rules.
*   **Currency:** The protagonist gives her two 100-yen notes. In 1948-1950, 200 yen was a significant amount (a starting salary for a teacher might be around 3,000 yen a month), making this a high-end "tip" or payment for a quick encounter.
*   **Western vs. Japanese Dress:** The mention of "Western clothes" (yousou) versus "kimono" and "koshimaki" (traditional wrap-around undergarment) reflects the cultural transition of the era. Western clothing was a sign of "modernity" or the "Pan-pan" (prostitute for GIs) aesthetic.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Pishiri-pishiri (ピシリ・ピシリ):** Onomatopoeia for a sharp, slapping sound.
*   **Ryokiteki (猟奇的):** Bizarre, grotesque, or seeking strange thrills. A very common buzzword in post-war pulp fiction.
*   **Dasureki (駄足):** Usually *dasoku* (蛇足) meaning "superfluous" or "redundant."
*   **Pon-biki (ポン引き):** A street tout or solicitor, often for prostitution.
*   **Gado-shita (ガード下):** The area under elevated railway tracks. These were (and sometimes still are) hubs for cheap bars, eateries, and illicit activity.
*   **Koshimaki (腰巻):** A traditional red or white wrap-around underskirt worn by women. In literature of this era, it often carries a heavy sexual connotation.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Nihilism:** The protagonist is "moderately drunk" and seeking "bizarre desires," suggesting a lack of moral direction common in the "Buraiha" (Decadent School) style of literature.
*   **The Transactional Nature of Human Connection:** The intimacy is bought with 100-yen notes, yet there is a "conscience" (ryoushin) shown by the woman when she giggles and apologizes for the fake "angry" act she had to put on to hide their deal.
*   **Social Hypocrisy:** The wife in the second scene (Ayako) expresses jealousy and resentment toward a neighbor who wears Western clothes, reflecting the social friction between traditional domestic life and the "new" modern/decadent influences.
*   **Urban Grittiness:** The setting—frozen pavement, railway tracks, dark alleys, and "checkpoints" of pimps—creates a noir atmosphere.
