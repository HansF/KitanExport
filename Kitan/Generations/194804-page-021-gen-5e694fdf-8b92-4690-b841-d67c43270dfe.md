**世界遊廓廢宿探檢**
**朝鮮カルボの卷**
忍一削

半夜の枕頭の妓生と言はず、本町のアベックに見る豪華（ヤン・パン）の質娘と言はず一様に優雅な朝鮮風俗が多く、ハイヒールに洋装の連中を見ても、そのワンピースのしつくりと板についていることは賞讃の外はない。
京城驛から汽車に乗つて京仁線で漢江に渡り五ツ六ツの驛を経て五十分、上仁川驛で下車する。
朝鮮豪家の邸宅町を一巡して波止場に出て左に折れて凡そ十丁。緑町々に出る。流石に朝鮮西海岸第一の港であり京城の海の玄関として立派なものである。
宏壯な表通りから一歩裏に廻ると朝鮮廓（カルボ）の軒並である。三軒に一軒位は玄関で例の朝鮮語で五人十人の妓が寄合せてはやり、たゞいゝ樣樓もあり、その表の道路では數人の男が例の腕組みをして、ボツンと無表情で一時間でも二時間でもうつとりと此れを眺め入つている。
その隣りの樓では、淡い電灯の藍で賣れ残りの妓が、お定まりの立膝でドンヨリとした眼をして往来を見ているのか、隣家の騒ぎを聞いているのか、極彩色の夏化粧がいやに侘しい。
また一軒は遙か奥の一間に十姉妹の様に妓が重なりあつた溜りの部屋があつて仲の一人が餘韻嫋々とした魂をゆする旋律の哀歌をくちづさんでいる。十五六位の雛妓の真紅で縁を取つた原色調の朝鮮服は可憐である。部屋は奇麗だし、妓はおとなしい。それにサービスは満點、京城新町よりは感触の點に於て一段とすぐれているようだ。仁川に来た序に、朝鮮最古の、開港場である港の北寄り月尾島遊園地の一帶三層建の中國貿易商と、生京料理店を訪問するが、津あたりで生まれた中國インテリ女給と言ふありふれた言葉ではその印象を表現することの出来ない位、それほど清楚とした。ジヤケツなんか着込み、ハイヒールを履いて、テーブルの間をカツカツと泳ぐ姿、十九か二十才迄の、スツキリした美人が多い。勿論腕次第でＴＨＡＴ’Ｓ・Ｏ・Ｓだ、その道のテクニカルは世界的なことは著名な街である。
情緒の街、仁川を萬喫して、京城に引き返えず、京城驛を午後十時十分に來れば翌朝午前八時には西海岸群山に着く。
驛前で「京町は？」ときけば、すぐ判る北約三丁、例によつて一廓をなしている。軒並にカルボの樓が四軒、妓生も二十人位はいる。京城仁川に比べて妓生は少しハイクラスらしい。元来、妓生は學楼が一番有名でこゝには妓生学校があつて、本格的な妓生ともなれば仲々大したものであるが、僅かのお金では、オイソレと不見轉のように簡単にはゆかない。
朝鮮――殊に北部朝鮮は大陸的な氣候で、三寒四温、三日寒くて四日宛位温くなる。晝は温かいが夕方から深夜にかけて、めつきり寒くなって来るので、例のオンドルを床下で焚き密封した部屋にとぢこもる。それは妓樓と言わず民家と言わずオンドルに籠る。密封した紙張りの部屋、門と閑房に金をかけることにかけては、敢て人後に落ちない。華麗な閑房は家族といえども、むだに入らせない尿瓶を枕頭に据えてそれで用を便じては、また寝につく、女は全裸体が上下を通じての慣體であるらしい。
古来、閑房に財を投じ、秘戲に秀れた國々はそれ自体、世紀末症状である。京城北郊の農村に最も此の名残を留めた華麗な房を見るにとどめよう。
京城郊外諸方から大道路の街に入るあたり、そここの路傍に延々と市が立つ、毎週一回だといふ。京城から龍山寄りのある街道の市（露店）を見た。それぞれの店は大きな雨傘一本を立てかけてゴザを敷き、農具から小間物、あやしな姐薬。食器、すべて汚い不用品店といつても一店傘一本の大きさですつかり賣り捌いても大した額でない品をならべ道路の兩側敷丁に及んでいる。
賣るも買うも、共にうす汚れた眼をしぱたいた老人やモモ患らわしい男が店を守つている。長い煙管をくわえながら、その店の前にしやがんだ白衣の老翁が、商品の農具を片ツばしからひねり廻して、どんよりとした目で側に寄つた相客を見あげる。のんびりとしたとゆうよりも、哀傷的な華麗な怨情こもる妓生の寝姿そのままの土地であつた。

**World Pleasure-Quarter & Ruined-Inn Exploration**
**Volume of the Korean "Karubo"**
By Shin'ichisaku (Pen name)

Whether it is the Kisaeng at the bedside in the middle of the night, or the high-class daughters (Yangban) seen as couples in Honmachi, there are many elegant Korean customs uniformly; even looking at the crowd in Western dress with high heels, the fact that those one-piece dresses fit perfectly and naturally is nothing but praiseworthy.
From Keijō (Seoul) Station, boarding the train on the Keijō-Incheon Line, crossing the Han River, passing through five or six stations, in fifty minutes, one gets off at Kami-Incheon Station.
Circulating through the residential district of wealthy Korean families and coming out to the pier, turning left for about ten chō (units of distance). One comes out to Midori-machi. Truly, as the number one port on Korea's west coast and the sea entrance to Keijō, it is a grand thing.
Turning one step behind the grand main street, there is a row of houses of the Korean Quarters (Karubo). In about one out of three houses, five to ten prostitutes gather at the entrance in the usual Korean style and thrive, though there are also some decent houses; on the road in front, several men with their arms crossed as usual, stand blankly and expressionlessly for an hour or even two hours, entrancedly gazing into this.
In the neighboring house, in the indigo of the dim electric light, a left-over prostitute, with her usual raised knee and listless eyes, is she looking at the traffic, or is she listening to the commotion of the neighbor’s house? Her colorful summer makeup is awfully lonely.
In another house, far in the back room, there is a waiting room where prostitutes overlap like Bengalese finches, and one of them is humming a mournful song with a melody that shakes the soul with lingering echoes. The primary-colored Korean clothes with crimson borders worn by the young prostitutes of fifteen or sixteen are lovely. The room is clean, and the prostitutes are gentle. Moreover, the service is perfect, appearing to be one step superior to Keijō’s Shinmachi in terms of sensation. Taking the opportunity of coming to Incheon, I visit the three-story Chinese trading houses and genuine cuisine restaurants in the area of Wolmido amusement park, north of the port which is the oldest open port in Korea; the "Chinese intellectual waitresses" born near the port—the impression cannot be expressed by such common words, they were that neat and pure. Wearing jackets and such, putting on high heels, and the sight of them click-clacking through the tables like swimming, there are many clean beauties up to nineteen or twenty years old. Of course, depending on one's skill, it is "THAT’S O.S"; that street's technical mastery is world-renowned.
Fully enjoying Incheon, the city of emotion, without returning to Keijō, if one takes the 10:10 PM train from Keijō Station, one arrives at Kunsan on the west coast at 8:00 AM the next morning.
If one asks at the station front, "Where is Kyōmachi?", it is immediately known about three chō to the north, forming a quarter as usual. In the row of houses, there are four Karubo houses, and about twenty Kisaeng. Compared to Keijō and Incheon, the Kisaeng seem to be slightly high-class. Originally, Kisaeng were most famous for their "school buildings," and there are Kisaeng schools here; if they become authentic Kisaeng, they are quite something, but with a small amount of money, it does not go as easily as "Mizuten" (betting without looking).
Korea—especially Northern Korea—has a continental climate, "three cold, four warm," getting warm for four days after three cold days. Daytime is warm, but from evening through late night, it becomes significantly cold, so they shut themselves in rooms sealed with the usual "Ondol" (underfloor heating) burning beneath. Whether it be a brothel or a commoner's house, they seclude themselves in the Ondol. Regarding spending money on sealed paper-covered rooms, gates, and the "Anbang" (inner room), they dare not fall behind others. Even family members are not allowed into the grand Anbang without purpose. Placing a chamber pot at the bedside, doing one's business there, and then returning to sleep; women appear to have a custom of being totally naked from top to bottom.
Since ancient times, countries that invested wealth into the Anbang and excelled in secret play are themselves in a state of fin-de-siècle symptoms. Let us stop at seeing the grand rooms that left the most traces of this in the farming villages of the northern suburbs of Keijō.
Entering the street of the large road from various directions of the Keijō suburbs, markets stand endlessly by the roadside here and there, said to be once a week. I saw a market (stall) on a certain road near Yongsan from Keijō. Each shop stands one large rain umbrella and spreads a straw mat, selling everything from farming tools to small wares and suspicious medicines. Tableware—though they are called dirty used-goods shops, with the size of one umbrella per shop, even if they sold out completely the items of no great value are lined up, extending several chō on both sides of the road.
Both selling and buying, old men blinking their grimy eyes and men with troubled thighs guard the shops. While puffing on long pipes, a white-clad old man crouching in front of the shop twists and turns the product farming tools one by one, looking up at the customer who approached with listless eyes. Rather than being leisurely, it was a land exactly like the sleeping posture of a Kisaeng, full of mournful and grand resentment.

**Expedition to the Pleasure Quarters and Ruined Inns of the World**
**The "Karubo" of Korea**
By Shin'ichisaku

Whether it be the *kisaeng* awaiting at one’s bedside in the dead of night, or the elegant daughters of the *yangban* nobility seen strolling as couples through the Honmachi district, Korea possesses many graceful customs. Even seeing the local women in Western attire and high heels, one cannot help but admire how naturally their one-piece dresses fit them.

Taking the train from Keijō Station on the Gyeongin Line, we cross the Han River and pass through several stops before arriving at Kami-Incheon Station fifty minutes later. After touring the residential quarters of the wealthy Korean elite, we head toward the pier, turn left, and walk for about a kilometer until we reach Midori-machi. As expected of the premier port on the west coast and the maritime gateway to Seoul, it is a magnificent sight.

Yet, step just one street behind the grand thoroughfares, and you find yourself among the rows of houses in the Korean pleasure quarters, known locally as the *karubo*. In every third house or so, groups of five to ten women gather at the entrance in traditional style, chattering in Korean. While some establishments are respectable, on the street outside, several men stand with their arms crossed, staring vacantly and expressionlessly for hours on end, as if entranced.

In the house next door, beneath the dim indigo glow of electric lights, a woman who has gone unchosen sits in the traditional posture with one knee raised. Her listless eyes seem to watch the passersby—or perhaps she is listening to the noise from the neighbors. Her vibrant, multi-colored summer makeup feels hauntingly lonely. In another house further back, several women are huddled together like small birds in a room; one of them hums a mournful song, its soul-stirring melody lingering in the air. The young *kisaeng*, barely fifteen or sixteen, are a piteous sight in their traditional Korean dresses of primary colors edged in crimson. The rooms are clean, and the girls are well-mannered. Indeed, in terms of the "feeling" of the service, they are a grade above those in Seoul's Shinmachi district.

While in Incheon, I visited the three-story Chinese merchant houses and authentic restaurants near the Wolmido amusement park, just north of the oldest port in Korea. To call the girls there "intellectual Chinese waitresses" born near the docks would be too common a phrase to describe them; they possessed a striking purity. Many were refined beauties of nineteen or twenty, clacking across the floor in high heels and jackets. Depending on your approach, they are "all systems go"—the sophistication of this district is world-renowned.

After soaking in the atmosphere of Incheon, instead of returning to Seoul, one can take the 10:10 PM train and arrive at Kunsan on the west coast by 8:00 the next morning. Asking for "Kyōmachi" at the station leads one a few blocks north to another pleasure district. Here, there are four *karubo* houses and about twenty *kisaeng*. They seem somewhat higher class than those in Seoul or Incheon. Traditionally, *kisaeng* were famous for their training houses, and schools for them still exist here. Genuine, trained *kisaeng* are truly impressive, but one cannot expect to enjoy their company easily or cheaply with just a small amount of pocket change.

Korea—especially the north—has a continental climate characterized by "three days of cold and four days of warmth." While the days are mild, the temperature drops sharply from evening through the night, leading everyone to retreat into rooms sealed tight and heated by *ondol* (underfloor heating). Whether it is a brothel or a common home, people huddle within. The Koreans spare no expense on their gates and their inner chambers, known as *anbang*. These grand rooms are kept private even from family. There, it is said, women spend their time entirely unclothed, keeping a chamber pot by the bedside so they need not leave the warmth of the room even for their necessities.

Since ancient times, nations that have poured their wealth into these private chambers and excelled in secret pleasures have displayed symptoms of a "fin-de-siècle" decadence. We shall limit ourselves to observing these opulent rooms, which have left their strongest traces in the farming villages north of Seoul.

On the outskirts of Seoul, where the roads lead into the city, long markets stretch along the waysides once a week. I observed such an open-air market on the road near Yongsan. Each "shop" consisted of nothing more than a large umbrella for shade and a straw mat spread on the ground, selling everything from farm tools to trinkets and dubious medicines. Though these stalls are little more than junk shops, they line both sides of the road for hundreds of meters, selling items of little value.

Both the buyers and sellers are old men with bleary eyes or men with physical ailments. Puffing on long pipes, elderly men in white robes crouch before the stalls, turning farm tools over in their hands and looking up with listless eyes at those who pass. More than being simply "leisurely," the land itself felt like the sleeping posture of a *kisaeng*—a place steeped in a grand and mournful resentment.
