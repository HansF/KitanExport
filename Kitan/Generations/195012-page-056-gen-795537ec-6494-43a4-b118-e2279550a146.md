## 2️⃣ Normalized Japanese

てきたような、とりとめのない脱落感が大きく支配していた。
　昨夜のことだ。夕食が終わり秋子は頭痛を感じた。風呂へ行こうと誘った姉の声に黙って首を振った。姉は急に目を輝かせて、「本当かな？」という風に秋子を見た。生理のためと解してくれたらしい。「うん……」姉の素振りに秋子はうなずいて見せた。実は予定日まで一週間もある。だが秋子は姉の目に反発をふと感じた。危険なひとときを義兄と持つことに、スリルめいた期待が働いてきた。
　姉が割り切れない顔で下駄を鳴らして出て行き、五分も経たないうちに、義兄は秋子の前へにやにや笑いながら近づいてきた。夫と反対に物柔らかで、馴れ馴れしい態度から、何となく淫らなものが発散している。秋子は瞬間、羞恥よりも戦慄を覚えた。舐めるような低い、その癖女心をぐいと捉える撫で声で、「子供を産まない女はいつまでも若くてスベスベした肌を……」突然手を掴まれ、ハッとする間に引き寄せられて腰を抱かれた。他愛もなく義兄の膝の上に崩れ、激しい力で抱きすくめられていた。抵抗しようとする意識が頭に走るよりも早く、すでに義兄の唇がぐいと迫った。何という素早さだろうかと、混乱した狼狽の中で秋子は驚嘆した。夫の場合の尺度では測り知れない見事な早業である。
　ぬるりと触感を唇に感じた時、産毛がふうと逆立った気がした。人妻だという恐れが峻烈な罪悪感を自覚させ、愕然とした衝動に秋子は、墜ち込んだ男の胸と腕の谷間から跳ね起きた。右腕でこしこし唇をこすり、ペッと畳の上に唾を吐き散らした。荒い呼吸が秋子の言葉を遮り、逆上した頭脳が燃え上がって何の思考力すらなかった。ただよろめく眼が眩み、重大な過失を犯した迂闊な、そして怠惰な自分の女の奥に住む、女の煩悩の醜さ卑しさに惧れを抱いた。義兄を憎むよりも秋子は、自らスリルを求めんとした、女の意欲を恥じた。渇いた女の心が、今何を要求し何を吸い込もうとしているかを知ってきた。
　義兄は照れた顔で唾を飲み込み、秋子が表の間で布団を敷き、その上にぼんやり座った時、姉がせかせかと溝板を踏んで戻ってきた。

　　　　三

「秋子さん、あいつの言ったこと気にしなはんなや。へっ、けったいな女やで……」
　下関行きの列車の窓から、すさまじい嫉妬の色を漲らせて、「ええか、女は身持ちが大事やよって……」そう繰り返した姉の意外な響きが、耳に傷をつけていた。秋晴れの午後の梅田付近は、若いアベックが澄み渡った装いを誇らしげに振りまいていた。義兄の訛りの多い言葉が姉の声とだぶついて秋子を郷愁に誘う。他人の睦まじさを見て郷愁を想う女の悲しさ、女の、私の辿ろうとする道はどこにあるのか……家庭を捨て夫を棄て去った妻の望郷が目指すものは……私はエトランゼだ。
　相乗りの輪タクに揺られ、それを知りつつも秋子には義兄と行動を共にしているという実感がない。脳裏の片隅で、売られた女が固い無表情な姿勢で車窓にもたれている一齣の、古いおぼろげな映画のワンカットが浮かんだ。
　家に入ると義兄はにわかに活気づいて、こまめに立ち回り酒の支度をする。時折り台所からも首を延ばして座敷の真ん中へ、崩れた人形のように座っている秋子へ笑いかけることを忘れない。その目に秋子は夫に見ない男の情欲の炎の色を知る。何もかも秋子には不思議だ。水のような夫と風の中の炎のような義兄の対照が、秋子を好奇の世界へいざなうのだった。カーテンに遮断された陽が、午後の室に夜の幻影と雰囲気を作り、口当たりの甘い酒が喉を流れ落ちると、知性の池は次第に熱を帯び、目元に駘蕩たる情緒が湧き上がってくる。
　頭が急に重くなった――あるいは押し倒されたのだろうか。私の心を誰かがいじっている。遠い感覚なのだ。いけないわ……防ぐ手が途中で止められ、誰かの指先が私の心をなおさら巧妙に酔わせてゆく。
　　　偸う（ぬすむ）
　名状しがたい慚愧（ざんき）が秋子の身を引き締めつける。麻痺せんとする知性が、ハッと覚醒した。
　美粧院（びしょういん）を出ると街は夜の気配だった。夫の求めているものを与えずして自分だけが与えられようとする図太さが恥ずかしい。うんと甘えてやろう……そして要求しよう。
　秋子は次第に小走りになる。家との距離が縮まることは、自分と夫との距離のそれである。肉体の距離……ゼロでなくてはならぬ。いや、マイナスになってこそ夫婦の営みは確立されるのだ。
　もう小半丁、秋子はついに走り出した。（了）

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

...was coming, a vague feeling of loss was largely dominating.
It was last night. Dinner ended and Akiko felt a headache. To the voice of her sister inviting her to go to the bath, she silently shook her head. The sister suddenly made her eyes shine and looked at Akiko as if to say "Is it true?" She seemed to interpret it as being due to menstruation. "Yeah..." In response to her sister's manner, Akiko nodded to show her. In truth, until the scheduled day, there is still one week. But Akiko felt a sudden repulsion in her sister's eyes. In having a dangerous moment with her brother-in-law, a thrill-like expectation had begun to work.
The sister, with an unsatisfied face, made her clogs ring and went out, and before five minutes passed, the brother-in-law came close to Akiko while smirking. Contrary to her husband, he was soft-spoken, and from his over-familiar attitude, something somehow lewd was emanating. Akiko, for a moment, felt a shiver rather than shame. With a licking low voice, which nonetheless grabs a woman's heart firmly, a stroking voice, "A woman who does not bear children, forever young and smooth skin..." Suddenly her hand was grabbed, and in the space of a "ha!", she was pulled close and her waist was held. Helplessly she crumbled onto the brother-in-law's lap, and was being held tight with violent force. Faster than the consciousness to try to resist ran through her head, already the brother-in-law's lips pressed firmly. What a quickness it was, Akiko marveled in the midst of her confused upset. It was a splendidly fast work unmeasurable by the scale of her husband's case.
When she felt a slimy sensation on her lips, she felt her fine hairs stand up. The fear of being a married woman made her realize a sharp sense of guilt, and with a startled impulse, Akiko sprang up from the valley of the man's chest and arms. With her right arm she rubbed her lips scrub-scrub, and spat saliva "pe-t" onto the tatami. Rough breathing obstructed Akiko's words, and her flushed brain burned up and there was not even any thinking power. Only her staggering eyes grew dizzy, and she felt fear at the ugliness and meanness of the woman's worldly passions dwelling deep within her—the careless and lazy woman who committed a grave fault. Rather than hating her brother-in-law, Akiko felt ashamed of the woman's desire that tried to seek the thrill herself. She came to know what her thirsty woman's heart was now demanding and trying to suck in.
The brother-in-law swallowed his true feelings with a shy face, and when Akiko spread the bedding in the front room and sat there blankly, her sister came back treading hurriedly on the gutter boards.

III

"Akiko-han, don't you be minding what that fellow said. Heh, he's a strange woman..."
From the window of the train bound for Shimonoseki, surging with a color of terrible jealousy, "Is it okay? For a woman, behavior (chastity) is important, so..." The unexpected ring of her sister who repeated that was wounding her ears. The Umeda vicinity on a clear autumn afternoon, young "abec" (couples) were proudly scattering their clear finery. The brother-in-law's dialect-heavy words overlapped with her sister's voice and invited Akiko into nostalgia. The sadness of a woman who feels nostalgia seeing other people's intimacy; the woman, the path I (watashi/warawa) am trying to follow, where is it? ...What is the destination of the homesickness of a wife who threw away her home and abandoned her husband? ...I am an "Etranze" (stranger).
Swaying in a shared "Rintaku" (cycle taxi), even while knowing it, Akiko has no actual feeling that she is acting together with her brother-in-law. In a corner of her brain, a single scene of a sold woman leaning against a carriage window with a hard, expressionless posture, a one-cut from an old, hazy movie floated up.
When they entered the house, the brother-in-law suddenly became lively and busily moved around making preparations for sake. Even from the kitchen he did not forget to stretch his neck and smile at Akiko, who was sitting in the middle of the parlor like a broken doll. In those eyes, Akiko knows the color of the flame of a man's lust that she does not see in her husband. Everything is strange to Akiko. The contrast of the water-like husband and the fire-in-the-wind-like brother-in-law invited Akiko to a world of curiosity. The sun blocked by curtains created a phantom and atmosphere of night in the afternoon room, and when the sweet-tasting sake flowed down her throat, the pond of intellect gradually took on heat, and a relaxed, carefree emotion welled up in her eyes.
Her head suddenly became heavy—or was she pushed down? Someone is tampering with my heart. It is a distant sensation. It's no good... the hand to prevent it was stopped midway, and someone's fingertips are making my heart drunk even more skillfully.
Stealing (偸う)
...an indescribable remorse tightened Akiko's body. The intellect that was about to be paralyzed suddenly awakened.
When she left the beauty parlor, the town had the air of night. The boldness of trying to be the only one given to without giving what her husband is seeking is shameful. I'll act very spoiled... and I'll demand.
Akiko gradually becomes a trot. The shortening of the distance to the house is that of the distance between herself and her husband. Physical distance... it must be zero. No, it is only by becoming a minus that the marital life is established.
One more half-block, Akiko finally started to run. (End)

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

A vague, listless sense of loss hung heavily over her.
It had happened the night before. After dinner, Akiko felt a dull headache coming on. When her sister invited her to the bathhouse, Akiko simply shook her head in silence. Her sister’s eyes suddenly lit up with a knowing glint, as if asking, "Is it that time?" She seemed to assume it was Akiko’s period. "Yeah..." Akiko nodded, playing along with her sister's assumption. In reality, her cycle wasn't due for another week. Yet, Akiko felt a sudden flicker of defiance against her sister’s gaze. A thrill of anticipation began to stir at the thought of spending a dangerous moment alone with her brother-in-law.

As her sister stepped out, the clatter of her wooden clogs fading away, less than five minutes passed before her brother-in-law approached with a smirk. He was soft-spoken, the polar opposite of her husband, but his over-familiarity exuded a palpable, lewd aura. In that instant, Akiko felt a shiver of dread rather than shame. "A woman who hasn't borne children," he whispered in a low, stroking voice that seemed to lick at her skin yet gripped a woman’s heart, "always keeps her skin so young and smooth..." Suddenly, he seized her hand. Before she could gasp, he pulled her close and wrapped his arms around her waist. She collapsed helplessly onto his lap, held fast by a violent strength. Before the thought of resistance could even cross her mind, his lips were already upon hers. Akiko was struck with wonder even in her panicked confusion; his speed was a masterwork, something utterly unimaginable by the measured standards of her husband.

When she felt the slick sensation against her lips, she felt the fine hairs on her neck stand on end. The terror of being a married woman sparked a searing sense of guilt. Startled by the impulse, Akiko broke away, springing up from the hollow of the man's chest and arms. She scrubbed her lips frantically with her right arm and spat onto the tatami mats. Her ragged breathing cut off any words, and her fevered brain burned, stripped of all reason. Her vision blurred, and she felt a terrifying glimpse of the ugliness and vulgarity of the feminine desires—the worldly passions of the careless, lazy woman—that lurked deep within her. Rather than hating her brother-in-law, Akiko felt ashamed of her own female ego that had sought out this thrill. She began to realize what her parched heart was truly craving, what it was trying to consume.
Her brother-in-law swallowed hard, looking sheepish. Later, as Akiko sat listlessly on the bedding she had laid out in the front room, her sister returned, her footsteps hurrying over the floorboards.

III

"Akiko, don't you mind a word of what that woman said. Hmph, what a strange one she is..."
From the window of a train bound for Shimonoseki, her sister’s eyes had overflowed with a terrifying jealousy. "Listen, a woman’s reputation is everything..." Those unexpected words, repeated over and over, had left a scar on Akiko's ears. On this clear autumn afternoon near Umeda, young couples paraded by, flaunting their pristine finery. The heavy dialect of her brother-in-law’s speech overlapped with the memory of her sister’s voice, pulling Akiko into a wave of nostalgia. How pathetic it was, she thought, for a woman to feel homesick just by witnessing the intimacy of strangers. Where was the path she was meant to take? What did a wife seek when she had abandoned her home and her husband? *I am an "Etranger"—a stranger in my own life.*

Swaying in a shared cycle-taxi, Akiko felt no real sense of being with her brother-in-law, even though she knew he was there. In the corner of her mind, a scene from an old, flickering movie appeared: a woman who had been sold, leaning against a train window with a stony, expressionless face. 
Upon returning home, her brother-in-law suddenly grew energetic, busying himself with the sake. Even from the kitchen, he kept peering into the parlor to smile at Akiko, who sat there like a broken doll. In his eyes, she saw the flaming lust of a man, something she never saw in her husband. Everything felt surreal. The contrast between her husband—cool as water—and her brother-in-law—a fire in the wind—lured Akiko into a world of forbidden curiosity. The sunlight, filtered through the curtains, cast the room into a nocturnal gloom. As the sweet sake slid down her throat, the cool pond of her intellect began to simmer, and a languid, melting emotion welled up in her eyes.
Her head grew heavy—or perhaps she was being pushed down. *Someone is toyng with my heart.* It felt like a distant sensation. *I mustn't...* But her hand reaching out to stop him faltered, and someone’s fingertips began to intoxicate her heart with even greater skill.

*Stealing...*
A nameless remorse constricted her body. Her numbing intellect suddenly snapped awake.
The night air greeted her as she stepped out of the beauty parlor. She felt a surge of shame at her own audacity—wanting to receive everything without giving her husband what he desired. *I’ll be sweet to him... I’ll ask for what I want.*
Akiko’s pace quickened into a trot. Each step that closed the distance to her house was a step that closed the distance between her and her husband. Physical distance... it had to be zero. No, only when it became a negative value could a marriage truly be forged.
With only half a block to go, Akiko finally broke into a run. (End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in the traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tategaki*), read from top to bottom and right to left. It occupies several columns on a magazine page.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of Kanji and Hiragana, with significant use of *furigana* (reading aids) for difficult kanji or to provide specific readings (e.g., 偸う read as *nusumu*, or 妾 read as *watakushi*).
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The section break is marked with a centered Roman numeral "III". The end of the story is marked with "(了)" (End) in the final column.
*   **Illustration:** At the bottom left, there is a simple line-art illustration of a woman (presumably Akiko) in a pensive or distressed pose, wearing mid-century Western-style clothing. The style is typical of *sashi-e* (inserted illustrations) found in 1950s popular magazines.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is dense but clearly delineated by vertical lines. The font is a standard Mincho style, common for printed literature of the era.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII/1950s):** The mention of "Rintaku" (輪タク - cycle taxi) and "Abec" (アベック - from the French *avec*, used to mean "couples") strongly suggests the late 1940s or 1950s. During this time, Japan was modernizing rapidly, but traditional family structures remained dominant.
*   **Geography:** The mention of "Umeda" (梅田) places the setting in Osaka. The sister's dialogue ("...shina-hanna-ya," "...kettai-na") is written in the Kansai dialect (*Osaka-ben*), adding regional flavor.
*   **Social Morality:** The central conflict involves a "dangerous" attraction to a brother-in-law (*gikei*), highlighting the internal struggle between individual desire ("thrill") and social duty ("shame," "guilt," "wife's reputation"). 
*   **Etranze (エトランゼ):** From the French *étranger*. This was a fashionable loanword in post-war Japanese literature, often used to describe a sense of alienation, existential wandering, or being an "outsider" within one's own society or family.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **義兄 (Gikei):** Brother-in-law. In the story, he represents a "forbidden" sexual vitality compared to the "water-like" husband.
*   **輪タク (Rintaku):** A portmanteau of *rin* (wheel/bicycle) and *taxi*. These were bicycle-drawn carriages common in the immediate post-war years before motor taxis became widely available.
*   **アベック (Abec):** An archaic term for a romantic couple, derived from the French word for "with."
*   **美粧院 (Bishōin):** An older term for a beauty parlor or hair salon.
*   **妾 (Warawa/Watakushi):** While usually an archaic humble female pronoun, here it is used in the narrative as a literary first-person "I" to deepen the character's internal monologue and sense of "womanhood."
*   **慚愧 (Zanki):** A literary term for deep shame or remorse.
*   **小半丁 (Kohanchō):** An old unit of distance. One *chō* is about 109 meters; *hanchō* is half that. It suggests she is just a few dozen meters from her house.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Repression vs. Desire:** Akiko is caught between the "coolness" of her husband and the "heat" of her brother-in-law. Her physical reaction (the thrill, the shiver) betrays a suppressed sexual desire.
*   **The "Other" Woman:** The text explores the idea of a "latent" or "ugly" womanhood that seeks pleasure outside of duty. Akiko fears the "lewd things" emanating from her brother-in-law but is also drawn to them.
*   **Alienation:** The use of the term "Etranze" suggests Akiko feels disconnected from her roles as a sister, wife, and social being. She sees herself as a character in a "hazy movie."
*   **Marital Reconciliation:** The ending shows a shift in Akiko's mindset. She realizes her "boldness" in seeking external thrills while neglecting her husband. Her run toward home symbolizes a return to her social role, but with a new determination to "demand" and "be spoiled," suggesting a move toward physical intimacy within the marriage ("minus distance").
