流していた。
　口を開けて白い歯をのぞかせ、笑うたびに、貝の足のような舌が、敏捷に動いた。
　私は反抗しているのであった。白獣たちの挑戦に、私はすでに昏倒し、無意識のうちに、いかなるリンチを加えられたかは、はっきりその事実こそ掴めないけれども、無数に鞭を加えられた傷跡を歴然とつけられているではないか。畜生ッ！私は、カッと両眼を開いた。笑っている彼女が赤い口の奥までのぞかせて、私の顎の下から、目を細めてうっとりと、何かを求めてもだえている。
「畜生ッ、白獣め！」
　彼女は、荒くれ男や特攻隊崩れに混じって、敗戦後すぐヤミ米の買い出しをしていた。野越え山越え、あるいはトンネルや河を渡り検問所を破って困難な米運びをしていたくらいだから強いのは無理もない。列車の屋根に這いつくばって走ったこともあった。それが今は優しい絹のような手に返っている。
「この力で、意識を失った俺を、よくも散々嬲りやがったな。」
　私たちは、湯から上がってから、妙に明るい電灯が気になった。
「君、何ていう名だい。」
「お新というの。曾根崎のお新、梅田のお新、カミソリのお新、いくらでもあるわ。」
　彼女は、いきなり、そう早口に言ったかと思うと、体を躍らせて電灯の真下に立った。私は、ハッと思った。

「合うと言っただけだよ。」
「松子、それに今日私が洗濯物を干しておいたら、勝手に位置を変えて、あなたのシャツにすれすれに自分の腰巻を干しておくんですもの、私、悔しくて、今日は胸がいっぱいなの（泣き声になる）」
川村「（松子の肩に手をやって）おい、おい、そりゃあ邪推だよ。僕は一遍だって、まだ隣の奥さんとは口をきいたことなんてないよ。」
松子「（顔を上げて）本当？でも、人の干し場を占領するなんて、馬鹿にしているわ。」
川村「今日は風が強かったから、きっとずれたんだよ。」
松子「そうかしら、それならいいんだけど……」
川村「（松子を抱えるようにして）つまらない邪推なんかで、お前と僕の恋愛生活を壊されてたまるものか。」
松子「あなた、ごめんなさいね。（川村の首にからみつく）」

翌日の朝。
アパートの屋上物干し場（第一景と同じ）
真ん中の仕切りを相当に隔てて、それぞれ赤い腰巻と白い猿股が、ヒラヒラと風に靡いている。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(I) was shedding/pouring.
Mouth opening white teeth peeking, every time (she) laughs, clam's foot-like tongue, nimbly moved.
I was resisting. To the white beasts' challenge, I already fainted, within unconsciousness, what kind of lynch (torture) was added, clearly that fact itself cannot be grasped but, infinitely whip-added scars clearly are attached, are they not? Damn! I, sharply both eyes opened. Laughing she, red mouth's interior even peeking, from under my chin, eyes narrowing entranced, something seeking writhing.
"Damn, white beast!"
She, rough men and special attack unit remnants mixed among, war-defeat immediately after black-market rice buying-trip was doing. Field crossing mountain crossing, or tunnel and river crossing checkpoints breaking difficult rice carrying was doing, so strong is no wonder. Train's roof crawling-flat ran also there was. That now gentle silk-like hands has returned to.
"With this strength, conscious-lost me, well thoroughly toyed with (you) did."
We, after rising from the bath, strangely bright electric light became concerned.
"You, what called name (is)?"
"O-shin called. Sonezaki's O-shin, Umeda's O-shin, Razor O-shin, plenty there are."
She, suddenly, so fast-talking said think then, body leaping electric light's directly under stood. I, "Ha!" thought.

(Bottom Right)
...said only that it fits.
"Matsuko, and today I laundry hung out if, selfishly position changed, your shirt grazing-close her own waist-wrap hung out, I, frustrated, today heart is full (becomes crying voice)."
Kawamura "(Matsuko's shoulder to hand putting) Hey, hey, that's groundless suspicion. I even once, yet next-door's wife with mouth spoke thing even-once not."
Matsuko "(Face lifting) Really? But, person's drying-place occupying, making a fool of (me) she is."
Kawamura "Today wind was strong because, surely shifted."
Matsuko "Is that so, then okay but..."
Kawamura "(Matsuko embracing-like) Trivial suspicion such-as, you and my love-life destroyed-allowed-to-be thing-no (must not happen)."
Matsuko "You, sorry okay. (Kawamura's neck to clinging)"

Fourth Scene
Next day morning.
Apartment's rooftop drying-place (same as Scene 1).
Middle's distance considerably separated, each red waist-wrap and white underpants, flutter-flutter and wind in swaying.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

...it was pouring out.
Whenever she opened her mouth to reveal her white teeth and laughed, her tongue flitted about nimbly, like the foot of a clam. 
I was putting up a fight. Though I had already collapsed under the onslaught of those "white beasts" and couldn't recall exactly what kind of "lynching" I’d endured while unconscious, the countless whip-like scars left on my body told the story clearly enough. 
"Damn it!" I snapped my eyes open. She was laughing, her red mouth open wide, looking up from beneath my chin with narrowed, entranced eyes, writhing as if searching for something.
"Damn you, you white beast!"
Directly after the surrender, she had lived among thugs and disgraced ex-kamikaze pilots, trekking for black-market rice. She had hauled heavy loads over mountains, through tunnels, and across rivers, dodging checkpoints. It was no wonder she was so strong; she’d even spent time clinging to the roofs of moving trains for survival. Yet now, those hands had returned to being as soft as silk.
"With that strength of yours, you certainly had your way with me while I was out cold, didn't you?"
After we got out of the bath, the peculiar brightness of the electric light began to bother us.
"Hey, what's your name?"
"They call me O-shin. Sonezaki O-shin, Umeda O-shin, 'Razor' O-shin... I’ve got names to spare."
No sooner had she blurted this out than she leapt up and stood directly beneath the light. My heart skipped a beat.

(Dialogue Section)
"...I only said it fits."
"Matsuko, listen! Today I hung the laundry out, and she just moved it all on her own. She hung her own petticoat so close it was practically rubbing against your shirt! I’m so frustrated, I can hardly breathe!" (She begins to sob.)
Kawamura: (Placing a hand on Matsuko’s shoulder) "Now, now, you’re just being paranoid. I haven’t spoken a single word to the woman next door."
Matsuko: (Looking up) "Really? But to just take over someone else’s drying space like that... she’s making a fool of me."
Kawamura: "The wind was strong today; I’m sure it just slid over."
Matsuko: "I suppose... if you say so."
Kawamura: (Drawing her into an embrace) "I won't let some petty jealousy ruin our life together."
Matsuko: "I’m sorry, darling." (She clings to his neck.)

Scene Four
The next morning.
The rooftop laundry area of the apartment (same as Scene 1).
Separated by a significant distance, a red woman's petticoat and a pair of white men's underpants flutter separately in the wind.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is split into a narrative section (top and left) and a script-like dialogue section (bottom right). This suggests the text might be a "photo-story" or a short story followed by a dramatized scene.
*   **Illustration:** The central image is a hand-drawn illustration depicting a man and a woman in a state of undress/relaxation (he in a robe/shirt, she in a yukata/kimono). The style is classic *Kasutori*—heavy on shadows, slightly eroticized, and focused on the gritty reality of cramped post-war living.
*   **Typography:** Vertical text. The use of "ッ" (small tsu) for emphasis in "畜生ッ" (Damn!) is typical of the pulp style to indicate a sharp, staccato exclamation.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the scene "四 景" (Scene 4) and "おわり" (End) are clearly marked, indicating the conclusion of a serialized piece or a multi-part short story.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War "Kasutori" Culture:** The term *Kasutori* refers to both a cheap, low-quality shochu and the magazines that flourished during the Occupation (1945–1952). These magazines were known for being "3-issue wonders" (disappearing as quickly as the dregs of the liquor) and focused on "3-S" content: Sex, Screen (movies), and Sports/Sensation.
*   **Tokko-tai Kuzure (特攻隊くずれ):** This refers to former members of the Special Attack Units (Kamikaze) who survived the war and returned to a society that no longer revered them. Many became disillusioned, joined gangs, or worked in the black market.
*   **Yami-gome (ヤミ米):** Food was strictly rationed after the war. People had to travel to the countryside to buy "black market rice" directly from farmers to survive. This was illegal and dangerous, involving hiding from police at train stations (checkpoints).
*   **Geographic References:** Sonezaki and Umeda are major districts in Osaka, known then (and now) for nightlife and entertainment, which grounds the story in a specific urban gritty reality.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Hakuju (白獣 - White Beast):** Likely a metaphorical term for a predator or perhaps a derogatory term used in the context of the era (could sometimes refer to Westerners, or simply a "beastly" woman).
*   **Rinchi (リンチ - Lynch):** In Japanese context, this often means a group beating or severe physical bullying/torture rather than the specific American historical definition.
*   **Koshimaki (腰巻):** A traditional red wrap-around underskirt worn by women. In literature of this era, the "red koshimaki" was a potent symbol of female sexuality and the domestic sphere.
*   **Sarumata (猿股):** Traditional men's underwear, similar to loose boxer shorts.
*   **Jasu (邪推):** Groundless suspicion or distrust, often used in romantic squabbles.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Strong Woman":** The narrative highlights the woman's physical strength gained from the black market struggle. This reflects a shift in gender dynamics post-war, where women often had to be "tougher" than men to feed their families.
*   **Domestic Jealousy vs. Post-War Survival:** The juxtaposition of the woman's violent past (clinging to trains) with the petty argument over laundry space shows the transition from the "survival" era to the "early reconstruction" era.
*   **Eroticism and Grime:** The focus on the bath, the "clam-foot" tongue, and the fluttering underwear at the end emphasizes the "niku-tai bungaku" (flesh literature) style popular at the time—focusing on the physical body as the only remaining truth in a defeated nation.

*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Occupation era, Black market, Romance, Melodrama, Eroticism, Gender roles.
*   **Classification:** Adult (due to suggestive themes and gritty tone).
