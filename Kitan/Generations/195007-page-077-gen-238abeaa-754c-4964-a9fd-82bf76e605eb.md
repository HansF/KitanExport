**俺らは靴みがき**
**綾 由紀夫**

エッヘッヘヘヘ、そりゃ、やつぱり何と言つたつて野郎の靴みがくよりや、娘つ子のちつちやな可愛いゝ靴をみがく方が悪い気持じやねえわね。磨く手に思わず力が入つり過ぎたりしてねヘッヘ……。
旦那の靴ア失禮だがもう買い直す時分だね。あんまりくたびれさしちや、いくら何でも靴が可哀そうだ。それや、こちらで商賣やつてるとね、この靴ア凡そ何ヶ月身穿いたもんだ位のことアー見して判らアね。……
それやそうとして、あつしの仇討物語つてのがあるんだ、それでも話そうか。ナニ、大丈夫だよ、口早えから両方の靴磨く間にや、ちやんと話すますよ。
ーその日も例の如く、この街角へ靴磨き台を据えて、いゝチップを呉れる客でも来ぬエもんかさポツンヤリ日向ぼつこをしていたと思いねえ。ところがね、そんな事を考えていると不思議なもので、立派なナリの紳士が向うからやつて来た。
こいつアカモだなと、そこは商賣だ、あつしにや直ぐ判つたね。磨く奴と磨かねエ奴アみがき屋の前を通る時の眼の色が第一違うのさ。
「旦那いかがで？」と誘いをかけると、「おゝ」とか何とか鷹揚にうなづきやがつてね、そうだね、どう安くふんでも五千円以下じやねえ豪勢な靴をあつしの鼻先へつき出したもんだ。
見てえ、そいつがつちつとも汚れてねエと来らア。いくら金が有り余るつたつてヒカ〜光つてる靴をその上に磨かせる奴なんて、どう考えたつてパカ〜しい無駄をする奴なんだぜ、どう考えたつてヘンだよ。
おかしな野郎だと思つて磨きながらチラリそいつの顔の下から覗いてみたー
おつしやこん公な立派な紳士なんぞに知り合いなんぞ持（つ）ような柄じやねエが、どうもそいつの顔にや見覚えがあるんだ。する

いよ〜様子が変だ。おやつと思う間に刑事がツカ〜と紳士の横にピタリと身を寄せるなり「おい静かにしろ」と来たにや驚いたね。
紳士の顔色が急にサツと蒼くなつたのが見えた。どういうわけかあつしや、その紳士の足をしつかり握つていたね。と、いきなり紳士が刑事にメリケンを喰わしたんだ。
で、あつしや夢中で捕まえてた野郎の足をねじつた。ま、早い話がそんなわけでこの野郎は難なく刑事に引立てられて行つたつたが、見覚えがあると思つたのも道理で、此奴ア昔あつしの靴問屋を乗取つた詐欺漢だつたエと、この邊を廻つている顔馴染の刑事が直ぐその横に立つてこう私を見てるわな。

**一、醜悪なせむし**
私は不幸とゆう悪魔を背負つて来た生れつきのせむしです。魔法使いの爺さんが持つている皮袋のような身体。ガサ〜とした荒い皮膚、刑務所の土塀のように厚い胸、あゝ、なんとながら醜い姿でしょう。
私は壁に向つていつも獨語しています。壁は哲学者です。私はしなびた顔をしながら六角形の柱時計の下でレンス磨きをしています。失うものとて何一ツない哀れな貧乏人なのです。

**二、足、足、足**
此處は繁華な港の街です。私はハトバの近くにある小さな蝸牛の家のような仕事場を持つています。私の仕事はさつき言つたように眼鏡のレンズ磨きですよ。
私は毎日コワレかかつた椅子に腰かけ、ゴミの一杯たまつた三角形の窓から街の舗道を通る女性の脛ばかり見て暮していました。
コンクリートのような固い足、生毛の生えた小麦色の足、餅の吸いつくような足、三ヶ月も卵巣を病んだ女のような疲きつた足、ベロ〜となめたいような良い足、あしアシ、足……
どうして私は彼女たちの足に、狂いになりそうな魅力を感じるのでしょう。そしてたえず熱帯の乾期の空のような明るい水々しい處女の白い肌が馬鹿に戀しいので。

**三、混血児の少女**
私の仕事場の隣には、ホテルと呼ぶには似合わないチッポケなインク壺のようなハリボテ建物があります。このホテルには透きとおる肉を（以下略）

**俺らは靴みがき（綾 由紀夫）**
エッヘッヘ、そりゃ、やっぱり何と言ったって野郎の靴を磨くよりは、娘っ子のちっちゃな可愛い靴を磨く方が悪い気持じゃないわね。磨く手に思わず力が入り過ぎたりしてね、ヘッヘ……。
旦那の靴は失礼だがもう買い直す時分だね。あんまりくたびれさせては、いくら何でも靴が可哀そうだ。そりゃ、こちらで商売やってるとね、この靴はおよそ何ヶ月履いたものか位のことは、見て分かるんだ。……
それはそうとして、あっしの仇討物語ってのがあるんだ、それでも話そうか。なに、大丈夫だよ、口が早いから両方の靴を磨く間には、ちゃんと話しますよ。
その日も例のごとく、この街角へ靴磨き台を据えて、いいチップをくれる客でも来ないものかと、ぼんやり日向ぼっこをしていたと思いなせえ。ところがね、そんな事を考えていると不思議なもので、立派ななりの紳士が向こうからやって来た。
「こいつはカモだな」と、そこは商売だ、あっしにはすぐ分かったね。磨く奴と磨かない奴は、磨き屋の前を通る時の目の色が第一違うのさ。
「旦那、いかがで？」と誘いをかけると、「おう」とか何とか鷹揚に頷きやがってね。そうだね、どう安く見積もっても五千円以下じゃない豪勢な靴を、あっしの鼻先へ突き出したもんだ。
見てな、そいつがちっとも汚れてないと来た。いくら金が有り余ってると言ったって、ピカピカ光ってる靴をその上に磨かせる奴なんて、どう考えたって馬鹿らしい無駄をする奴なんだぜ、どう考えたって変だよ。
おかしな野郎だと思って磨きながら、チラリとそいつの顔を下から覗いてみた。あっしのような男が立派な紳士なんぞに知り合いなんぞ持つような身分じゃないが、どうもそいつの顔には見覚えがあるんだ。

いよいよ様子が変だ。「おや」と思う間に、刑事がツカツカと紳士の横にぴたりと身を寄せるなり、「おい、静かにしろ」と来たのには驚いたね。
紳士の顔色が急にさっと青くなったのが見えた。どういうわけかあっしは、その紳士の足をしっかり握っていたね。と、いきなり紳士が刑事にメリケン（パンチ）を食らわしたんだ。
であっしは、夢中で捕まえていた野郎の足をねじった。ま、早い話がそんなわけで、この野郎は難なく刑事に連行されて行ったが、見覚えがあると思ったのも道理で、こいつは昔あっしの靴問屋を乗っ取った詐欺師だったんだ。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**We are Shoe Shiners (Aya Yukio)**
He-he-he-he, well, after all, no matter what you say, rather than polishing a rascal’s shoes, polishing a young girl’s tiny, cute shoes doesn’t feel bad at all. Without thinking, too much strength goes into the polishing hand, he-he...
Master’s shoes, excuse me, but it is about time to buy new ones. To wear them down this much, no matter what, the shoes are pitiful. Well, when doing this business here, just by looking, I can tell roughly how many months these shoes have been worn. ...
That aside, there is a story of my revenge; shall I tell it? What, it's fine, I'm fast-talking, so while polishing both shoes, I'll properly finish the story.
On that day as usual, setting my shoe-polishing stand at this street corner, I was absent-mindedly sunbathing, thinking if a customer who gives good tips might come. However, while thinking such things, strangely, a gentleman of fine appearance came from over there.
"This guy is a sucker," I immediately knew, being in the trade. People who want a polish and people who don't have different eye colors first of all when passing a polisher.
When I invited him saying "Master, how about it?", he nodded grandly saying "Oh" or something. Let's see, even at the cheapest estimate, shoes not less than 5,000 yen—magnificent shoes—he thrust before my nose.
Look, those weren't dirty at all. No matter how much money is left over, a guy who makes you polish shoes that are already shining is just doing a foolish, wasteful thing; no matter how you think about it, it's strange.
Thinking he was an odd fellow, while polishing, I peeked up at his face from below. A guy like me wouldn't have acquaintances among fine gentlemen, but somehow I recognized that face.
(Snippet)
The situation got strange. While I thought "Oh?", a detective walked up briskly, pressed right up to the gentleman's side, and said "Hey, be quiet." I was surprised.
The gentleman's complexion suddenly turned pale. For some reason, I was holding that gentleman's leg firmly. Then, suddenly the gentleman gave the detective a "Meriken" (punch).
So, I desperately twisted the leg of the guy I was holding. Well, to make a long story short, that guy was easily taken away by the detective, and there was a reason I thought I recognized him: this guy was the fraudster who once took over my shoe wholesale business.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**We’re Shoe Shiners**
*by Aya Yukio*

Heh-heh-heh... Well, you can say what you want, but polishing a little girl’s cute little shoes feels a lot better than scrubbing some old geezer’s boots. Sometimes I find myself putting a bit too much elbow grease into it without even realizing—heh-heh. 

Begging your pardon, sir, but it’s high time you bought a new pair. Wearing them down this far is just a crying shame for the leather. When you’ve been in this trade as long as I have, you can tell just by looking exactly how many months a pair’s been on the road.

But putting that aside, I’ve got a bit of a "revenge story" to tell. Want to hear it? Don’t worry, I talk fast—I’ll have the whole tale finished by the time I’m done with both your shoes.

It was a day like any other. I’d set up my stand on this corner and was just soaking up the sun, wondering if a customer with deep pockets might wander by. Then, as if by magic, a gentleman in fine clothes came strolling toward me.

"A real mark," I thought. In this business, you can tell. The look in a man's eyes when he passes a shoe shiner is the first giveaway.

"How about a polish, sir?" I asked. He gave a grand, haughty nod and thrust a pair of shoes under my nose that couldn't have cost a yen under 5,000. 

Get this—they weren't even dirty. I don't care how much money you’ve got to burn, paying to polish shoes that are already gleaming is just plain stupid. It felt wrong. 

Suspicious, I took a peek at his face from below while I worked. A guy in my position doesn’t usually rub shoulders with high-society types, but I knew I’d seen that face somewhere before...

Suddenly, things took a turn. Before I could blink, a detective stepped up right next to him. "Keep it quiet," he hissed. The gentleman went white as a sheet. For some reason, I found myself gripping his ankle tight. Suddenly, the "gentleman" threw a punch at the detective.

I didn't think—I just twisted the leg I was holding with everything I had. Long story short, the cops hauled him off without a fuss. Turns out my hunch was right: the bastard was the very same swindler who’d cheated me out of my shoe wholesale business years ago.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** This is a classic example of a page from a Japanese "pulp" magazine (likely *Kasutori* genre). It features multi-column vertical text, hand-drawn decorative titles, and a central illustration.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "俺らは靴みがき" is large and bolded with furigana (reading aids) for "俺ら" (Ore-ra) and "靴" (Kutsu). The author's name is placed prominently to the right. The bottom section is clearly demarcated with a "猟奇小説" (Bizarre Fiction) header in a stylized, jagged font to evoke a sense of mystery or horror.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard movable type font of the era. Notably, the small "tsu" (っ) is sometimes represented as a full-sized "つ", which was common in older printing or specific stylistic choices of the 1940s-50s.
*   **Illustration:** The central drawing shows a stylized, somewhat cartoonish interaction between a shoe shiner (squatting) and a customer. The inclusion of the word "Strip" (ストリップ) and "Review" (レビュー) in the background hints at an entertainment district setting (like Ginza or Shinjuku).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Shoe Shiners:** After WWII, many people in Japan (including war orphans and former businessmen who lost everything) took up shoe shining in urban centers. It was a symbol of the struggle for survival in the scorched-earth ruins.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** Named after a cheap, low-quality shochu, *Kasutori* magazines flourished between 1946 and 1955. They were known for being sensationalist, often featuring "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense) content to provide escapism for a traumatized population.
*   **Currency and Value:** The mention of "5,000 yen" for shoes gives a hint of the era's inflation and the divide between the working poor and the "newly rich" or criminals. 
*   **The "Meriken":** This refers to "Meriken-sako" (brass knuckles or a heavy punch), derived from "American." It was common slang for a punch or a weapon used in street fights.
*   **Discrimination:** The term "せむし" (semushi) refers to Kyphosis (hunchback). In modern Japan, this is considered a highly discriminatory and taboo term (*pōsō-go*), but in the "猟奇" (Ryōki) genre of the mid-20th century, physical deformities were frequently used as tropes for "bizarre" or "grotesque" storytelling.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **あっし (Asshi):** A humble/colloquial first-person pronoun used by the working class or craftsmen, often associated with the "Edokko" (Tokyoite) dialect.
*   **カモ (Kamo):** Short for "Kamo ga negi o seote kuru" (A duck coming with a green onion on its back), meaning an easy target or a "sucker."
*   **鷹揚 (Ōyō):** Generous, magnanimous, or haughty/composed. Here it implies the customer is acting "above" the shiner.
*   **詐欺漢 (Sagikan):** A "fraudster man." The use of "漢" (kan/man) here adds a slightly gritty, hard-boiled flavor to the description of the criminal.
*   **メリケン (Meriken):** Slang for a punch (American-style).
*   **猟奇 (Ryōki):** Seeking the bizarre, grotesque, or macabre. A major literary subgenre in early-to-mid 20th century Japan.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Class Resentment and Justice:** In the first story, the shoe shiner experiences a "reversal of fortune." He is a victim of a fraudster who stole his business, forcing him into street work. The moment of catching the criminal by the very shoes he was polishing is a classic "poetic justice" trope.
*   **Voyeurism and Obsession:** The second story ("Feet, Feet, Feet") highlights the fetishistic and voyeuristic themes common in Ryōki literature. The narrator, marginalized by his disability ("hunchback") and poverty, finds a perverse obsession with the feet of women passing by his basement-like workshop.
*   **Urban Decay:** Both stories are set in "the streets" or "the port town," emphasizing the gritty, crowded, and often dark nature of post-war urban life.
*   **The "Gaze" from Below:** Both narrators look at the world from a low physical position—the shiner at the feet of customers, the lens polisher from a small window at ground level. This represents their social status and their unique perspective on the "upper" world.
