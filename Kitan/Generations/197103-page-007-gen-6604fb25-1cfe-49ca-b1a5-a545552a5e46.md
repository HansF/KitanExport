**The Mantis's Hatchet** (Page 10)

...Opinion... **Recommendation of Lateral Thinking**

**The Mantis's Hatchet**
**Seto Yoshiya**

I, who do not even read books carefully and am unstudious, thinking of writing such things, find it very cheeky and very amusing... Reading Mr. Saku Suwa’s "A Certain Serious Nonsense" in the November issue, I laughed for the first time in a long while. Before his series of "nonsense," my head, which ought to be light, remains strangely lowered [in respect], but the "valuable nonsense" seeping from his noble character is, in every tease and every irony, entirely sharp and acute.

At the very least, compared to the childishness of some readers who seem to think themselves "high-class highbrow hobbyists overflowing with elite consciousness, who want to say 'enough already' to novels that merely mix in SM-like elements with half-baked SM knowledge just because it's a trend," there is a difference as vast as heaven and earth. In fact, there are strange madmen in this world; there are madmen who brazenly flaunt their own madness toward decent people, which is truly a lunatic's way of thinking and acting, but it leaves my jaw dropped and my mouth wide open.

This time, since the Mr. Suwa whom I respect has so aptly exposed the partial ignorance of some readers, I shall follow in his footsteps and spew a little venom myself. However, the following is strictly the personal opinion of a single reader and is entirely like "the streamers of May carp—all mouth and no guts," so there is no great need to pay it mind. Of course, whether you laugh or get angry is up to the reader; I shall not concern myself with it.

About half a year ago, there was a person who always made a point of proudly calling himself a "Kitan [Club] Old Fan," and in real... [text cuts off]

**The Mantis's Hatchet** (Page 10)

**A Column of Opinion: In Praise of Lateral Thinking**
**By Seto Yoshiya**

For an unlearned man like myself, who rarely gives a book a proper reading, to attempt a piece like this is as audacious as it is entertaining. I recently read Saku Suwa’s piece, "A Certain Serious Nonsense," in the November issue, and it gave me my first good laugh in ages. While my own flighty head usually bows in deference to his "nonsense," the "valuable nonsense" born of his noble character is, in every barb and irony, utterly incisive and razor-sharp.

He takes aim at those "highbrow hobbyists"—self-important elites who dismiss modern fiction for merely sprinkling in SM elements to chase a trend with only a superficial understanding of the craft. Compared to the sheer puerility of such readers, Suwa’s work is in a league of its own. It is truly astounding how some "madmen" in this world have the gall to flaunt their delusions before decent society. It is the logic of the insane, and it leaves me quite literally slack-jawed.

Now that the esteemed Mr. Suwa has so brilliantly dismantled the ignorance of a certain subset of our readership, I feel compelled to follow his lead and vent a little bile of my own. Be warned: these are merely the private musings of a single reader. They are like May Day carp streamers—all mouth and no substance—so feel free to ignore them. Whether you choose to laugh or take offense is entirely your prerogative; it is no business of mine.

It brings to mind an encounter about six months ago with a man who habitually boasted of being a "Kitan Club Old Fan." In reality...

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** Editorial / Reader Critique / Column. This is a common format in "pulp" or fetish magazines where a regular contributor or a prominent reader responds to previous articles, often using a "combative" yet intellectual tone.
*   **Author Attribution:** Seto Yoshiya (セト・ヨシヤ). The name suggests a regular columnist or a recognized intellectual within the *Kitan Club* circle.
*   **Voice:** Cynical, self-deprecating ("unstudious"), yet highly literate and elitist in its own way. It employs the "persona" of a humble observer to launch a biting critique of other readers.
*   **Positioning:** Located on page 10, early in the magazine, indicating this is a featured column meant to engage the core community and spark internal "literary" debate.

---

## Cultural & Historical Annotations

*   **Tōrō no Ono (蟷螂の斧):** A classic idiom (The Mantis's Hatchet/Axe) referring to someone who overestimates their strength and challenges a much more powerful opponent (like a mantis trying to stop a carriage with its claws). Here, it's used ironically to describe the author's "weak" attempt to criticize others.
*   **SM (Sadomasochism) in the 1950s:** This was the era of the "SM Boom" in Japan. Magazines like *Kitan Club* were transitioning from general "Kasutori" (cheap pulp) to specialized fetish interest. The author is critiquing the "trend-chasers" (流行) who don't understand the "philosophy" or history of the practice.
*   **Highbrow (ハイブロー):** Using English loanwords was a sign of intellectualism/modernism in post-war Japan, but here it is used derisively against those who put on airs.
*   **Kichi-gai (気違い):** A term for "madman" or "crazy" that is now considered highly offensive and is usually censored in modern Japanese media. In this context, it refers to "maniacs" or obsessive fans who lack self-awareness.
*   **Satsuki no Koi no Fukinagashi:** A reference to the hollow carp streamers flown on Children's Day (May 5th). It's a common idiom for a "big talker" who has no inner substance or courage.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **唆切 (Shunretsu / 峻烈):** Extreme severity or sharpness. The original text uses a slightly non-standard kanji choice (唆), common in period printing.
*   **犀利 (Sairi):** Sharp, keen, or acute (often used to describe a sharp wit or a blade).
*   **喝破 (Kappa):** To lay bare the truth; to scold and expose a fallacy.
*   **驥尾に附して (Kibi ni fushite):** Literally "to cling to the tail of a 1,000-mile horse." It means to follow a great person’s lead or to contribute something small to a great cause.
*   **奇ク・オールドファン (Kitan/Ki-ku Old Fan):** "Kitan" refers to the magazine *Kitan Club*. An "Old Fan" refers to someone who has been reading since the early post-war years, often claiming a higher status than "new" fans.

---

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Gatekeeping and Elitism:** The core theme is the tension between "true" practitioners/fans of SM and those who follow it as a shallow trend.
*   **Intellectualism vs. Pulp:** The author uses highly sophisticated vocabulary (驥尾, 喝破, 犀利) to discuss "low" subjects (SM, pulp fiction), a hallmark of the *Kitan Club* style which sought to legitimize fetishism as a "literary" pursuit.
*   **Shame and Visibility:** The author mocks those who "flaunt" their madness/fetishism to "decent people," suggesting a code of conduct or a "secret society" feel where such things should be discussed with a certain level of sophisticated "lateral thinking" rather than crude openness.

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** Low (Meta-discussion of SM; no explicit acts described).
*   **Violence:** None.
*   **Language:** Moderate (Use of "kichi-gai" / lunatic).
*   **Themes:** Gatekeeping, subculture politics, intellectualism.
