## Literal English Translation
Beauties Voluntarily Seeking Rope/Rape [Bondage/Violation]

Depending on the training, 99 out of 100 women can become masochists—this is the theory of veteran SM maniacs. Certainly, even psychologically speaking, women fundamentally possess an M tendency, and whether this is actualized depends entirely on the skill of the partner.
The five women appearing here, though differing in degree, all uniformly have experience with rope [bondage], and even if they don't particularly like it, they show no rejection reaction. That is to say, they hide the potential to transform in any way, depending on the partner. Those hoping for a relationship: if you cut out the partner’s photo and mail it to the editorial office, it will be forwarded to the person herself.

A Woman's Gamble: Sexual Adventure

(NO. 1 Kyōko Hayashi, 25 years old)

♡ I was half-forcibly subjected to SM—like, "This is what SM is like, you see"—by my close friend’s girlfriend and her boyfriend. Initially, it was just painful, and I thought M was a truly miserable thing. But recently, my thinking has changed slightly. If only I could be treated gently and softly, wouldn't I become able to enjoy the play? Therefore, the partner I hope to associate with must be limited to those of the Romantic school, skilled in technique. Please kindly lead me and guide me into the world of wonderful SM.
(NO. 1 Kyōko Hayashi, 25 years old)

♡ My husband is a very serious and kind person, but besides being extremely shy, he lacks power, and I am always tormented by an unfulfilled feeling/desire. I burn uncontrollably when I am violently violated and whispered shameful words right in my ear. I wish to secretly associate with a man who can do such a thing.

(NO. 2 Yoshiko Maeno, 28 years old)

I hope for someone muscular and robust, preferably younger than me. Everyone says my charm point is my slender *anyo* (ankles/legs/crotch area). I am a married woman waiting for the appearance of a man who will forcefully tear open these *anyo*.
(NO. 2 Yoshiko Maeno, 28 years old)

## Literary English Translation
Beautiful Women Voluntarily Seeking Bondage and Violation

The theory held by veteran SM maniacs is that, given the right training, 99 out of 100 women can become masochists. Certainly, even from a psychological perspective, women inherently possess a latent M tendency, and whether this is brought to fruition depends entirely on the skill of the partner.
The five women featured here, while varying in degree, all have uniform experience with rope play, and even if they don't particularly enjoy it, they display no signs of rejection. This means they harbor the potential for complete transformation, depending solely on the man. Those desiring an introduction: if you cut out and mail the partner’s photo to the editorial office, we will forward it to the woman herself.

A Woman's Gamble: Sexual Adventure

(NO. 1 Kyōko Hayashi, 25)

♡ I was introduced to SM by my close friend’s boyfriend, who explained, "This is what SM is all about," while subjecting me to semi-violent treatment. At first, it was nothing but pain, and I truly thought being an M meant being worthless. But recently, my view has begun to shift slightly. If only I could be treated gently and softly, perhaps I could learn to enjoy the play? Therefore, the partner I seek must be limited to a romantic type, highly skilled in technique. Please kindly take the lead and guide me into the world of truly wonderful SM.

(NO. 2 Yoshiko Maeno, 28)

♡ My husband is a very serious and kind man, but he is exceedingly shy and, frankly, lacks power. I am constantly tormented by a feeling of unfulfilled desire. I burn uncontrollably when I am violently violated and when shameful words are whispered right into my ear. I long to secretly begin an affair with a man who can provide such an experience.

(NO. 2 Continuation)

I desire someone muscular and robust, preferably younger than me. Everyone says my slender *anyo* (legs/inner thighs) is my best feature. I am a married woman awaiting the emergence of a man who will forcefully tear open those *anyo*.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
**Section Type:** Reader Profiles / Partner Solicitation Feature, presented as an erotic investigative piece (pseudo-ethnography). This section functions as a highly stylized personal ad feature where the magazine mediates contact between readers seeking extreme S/M partners.

**Author Attribution:**
1.  **Editorial Block:** Anonymous Editorial Staff (speaking with authoritative jargon).
2.  **Profiles:** Attributed to the named women (Kyōko Hayashi, Yoshiko Maeno), presented as direct, stylized confessions.

**Editorial Voice:** Clinical, sensational, and facilitating. It sets a theoretical justification for female masochism and provides actionable steps for male readers to initiate contact ("cut out the photo").

**Narrator Voice (Profiles):** First-person female using *atai* (あたい), indicating a desire for frankness and possibly rebellion against social norms. The language is focused entirely on detailing specific, extreme sexual needs not met by conventional life.

**Target Audience Signals:** Primarily male readers seeking submissive S/M partners, who are skilled, dominant, and physically robust.

## Cultural & Historical Notes
**Postwar Sensationalism:** This text reflects the explosion of ero-guro publishing in post-war Japan (Showa era, likely 1950s/60s). It uses hyperbolic claims (99 out of 100 women) to normalize and sensationalize extreme sexual behavior.

**Jōkan (縄姦):** The combination of 'rope/bondage' (縄) and 'violation/rape' (姦) is a core trope of Japanese SM, representing the desired fantasy of controlled, yet forceful, non-consensual submission. The term *shigan* (voluntary seeking) makes this a self-contradictory, highly charged fantasy.

**The Unsatisfied Housewife Trope:** The situation of Yoshiko Maeno (No. 2)—a wife trapped with a kind, serious, but sexually inadequate/shy husband (lacking *power*)—is a pervasive trope in this genre, used to justify female readers' exploration of adultery and violence-based fantasies.

**Anyo (アンヨ):** A crucial fetish term. While literally meaning "foot" or "leg," in erotic context, especially with the qualifier "slender" (ほっそりした), it refers to the lower extremities, inner thighs, or crotch, emphasizing a specific focus for bondage and sexual assault fantasies. The wish to have them "forcefully torn open" (強引に割り裂く) is a direct, violent euphemism for aggressive penetration.

**SM Schools:** The reference to the "Romantic school" indicates a preference for S/M that is not merely brute force, but is integrated with emotional drama, skilled technique, and aesthetic presentation—a hallmark of Japanese Shibari culture development.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
| Term (Japanese) | Contextual/Euphemistic Meaning | NLP Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 縄姦 (Jōkan) | Voluntary seeking of sexual violation/bondage rape. | Highly specific S/M jargon combining control and force. |
| Mの気 (M no ke) | Latent masochistic inclination. | Clinical/jargonistic term for submissive tendency. |
| 腕次第 (Ude shidai) | Dependent on the partner's skill or sexual technique. | Used to emphasize the male's role as the active agent. |
| パワー不足 (Pawā fusoku) | Lack of sexual dominance or assertiveness (in the husband). | Common euphemism for marital sexual dissatisfaction. |
| アンヨ (Anyo) | Slender legs, inner thighs, or genital area (fetish object). | Historical euphemism, often associated with leg/foot fetishism in Japanese SM art. |
| 暴力的に犯され (Bōryoku-teki ni okasare) | Desire for aggressive, rough, non-tender sexual penetration. | Explicit statement of sexual violence fantasy. |
| こつつりおつき合い (Kossori otsukiai) | To secretly have an affair/engage in a hidden sexual relationship. | Suggests adultery. |

## Themes & Subtext
**Primary Theme:** The eroticization of powerlessness and transgression. The women explicitly crave the experience of being overwhelmed, dominated, and sexually violated, thereby reversing the power dynamics of their polite, normal lives.
**Subtextual Anxiety:** Anxiety regarding male weakness (the husband's "power shortage") and the corresponding female frustration that requires extreme measures to release. Fulfillment is achieved through the acceptance of forceful dominance, suggesting a deep-seated belief that female desire is inherently linked to submission and pain.
**Voyeurism/Exhibitionism:** The use of photos and detailed, shocking confessions creates a high level of exhibitionism, inviting male readers (the voyeurs) into the women's secret desires, which are then facilitated by the magazine itself.

## Content Classification Tags
