あの世にまで延長して「不老

ところが遂に人間が死なな

博士によると、医者が脈を

この方法によつて、一度死

「私はそれは――軟かい暗黒
の中にフワリ――と浮いてい

そして、更に言うには、
「死というものが、あんなに
楽しい者であるならば今後何
回でも死にたいと思います」
……だと。
これならば、始めから死な

でみて、まだ生き返つて来た
方がよさそうである。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**The 200,000 Yen Woman**
"In the world, everyone is saying so. The world is a quite foolish thing, isn't it?"
"But the talk is it's a fact that you have savings of 200,000 yen."
"Oh, no. If there were 200,000 yen, in this kind of place, I wouldn't be doing this kind of 'pan-pan' (street prostitution). However, men are strange things, aren't they, ever since they knew maybe I have 200,000 yen, suddenly customers increased."
"Is it because they think to swindle it?"
"Probably not that, but somehow they feel like they are sleeping with a 200,000 yen woman, I wonder?"
"I do not have such a feeling."
"That's why I love you."
"You're talking skillfully."
"It's true, even if I was penniless, you would come to see me, wouldn't you?"
Saying so, the woman embraced me.
I felt that somewhere in the woman's body, a 200,000 yen passbook was hidden, and I could not touch her body with my hands.

**Lie or Truth? Dead People Can Freely Return to Life**
From 1,000 years ago, no, maybe from 10,000 years ago, what humans feared most seems to have been "death."
Therefore, the place where medicine makes its highest ideal is in eternal youth and longevity, naturally. This thing does not change throughout old and new times, East and West. However, by all means, this cannot be done. So, humans, having nothing else but "praying to God," in order to die peacefully, taught things called religion, and extended "life" of this world to that world, substituting it for "eternal youth and longevity."
However, finally humans gave up the effort not to die, and succeeded in a method of returning to life once more even if they die.
If this is a fact, future humans will be able to die any number of times.
"What number death is this for this person?"
"It is the third time."
It is that kind of thing.
An American MD named Hyman announced that if one uses an artificial heart stimulator he recently invented, even if one dies, they can be splendidly resuscitated.
According to the doctor, even if a doctor while taking the pulse declares "it is the end," the heart has not completely died yet, and until it becomes completely incapable, it takes 16 minutes and 10 seconds. In that interval, the first 90 seconds are even better, but when you pierce the heart with a 19-karat gold needle of the stimulator and on the other hand, through a 4 or 5 inch gold wire, pass a current of 1/1000th of a volt to the body, by the action of electrical energy, the heart starts beating again. Thereupon, if you apply a special cold medicine, it is said you can make them return to life splendidly. The doctor says by this method, he has already succeeded in returning twelve dead people to life.
According to a story of a person who died once and returned to life by this method:
"I was floating -- softly -- in a soft darkness. Was it not pleasant. And there, there was only great peace and complete satisfaction."
And, further says,
"If a thing called death is such a fun thing, I want to die any number of times from now on."
...so it's said.
If this is so, rather than not dying from the start, it seems better to try dying once or twice and come back to life again.

**What About Women?**
(1) Why are buttocks large?
Overhearing "Why are women's buttocks large?", Mi-chan shouted while laughing happily.
"That's because they eat lots of sweet potatoes."
However, the buttocks of Mi-chan who said so are not as large as her older sister's.
According to the theory of archaeologists, the enlargement of women's buttocks was after Eve received and ate the fruit of wisdom from the snake in the Garden of Eden. The moment she thought "it was delicious" eating the fruit of wisdom, the feeling of "shame" also arose, and at the same time, her buttocks suddenly puffed up, it is said.

(2) No beard?
Beards, it seems they don't do well because they become an obstacle to kissing. That's why in the West, it is decided to shave the beard -- to skin-smooth -- surely in the morning and evening, but I have heard this is out of manners, so as not to give an unpleasant feeling to the partner when kissing. However, not having a beard is also a matter of degree, and women also have beards after all.

**Funny Stories**
Love Seat:
Husband: "Young people lately seem unexpectedly happy about the congestion in the trains."
Wife: "Oh, why?"
Husband: "Because they can sit on the partner's lap."
Wife: "..."

Then Exposed:
Young man: "Hey, Miss, I'm really decadent. You understand this pure heart of mine, don't you."
Young lady: "Yes, I understand well. Mr. Murata's daughter also said so, that your 'pure heart' was just smooth talk she was tricked by."
Young man: "?"

Oh, oh, oh:
"In your mother's time..."
"I know, you're going to say you didn't know about romance, right?"

**The 200,000 Yen Woman**
"That's what everyone is saying. People can be so foolish, don't you think?" she remarked.
"But the word is it's a proven fact you have 200,000 yen in the bank."
"Oh, please. If I had 200,000 yen, I wouldn't be working as a 'pan-pan' girl in a place like this. But men are strange creatures. Ever since the rumor started that I might have that kind of money, I’ve suddenly had more customers than I can handle."
"Because they’re hoping to swindle it out of you?"
"I don't think so. I think they just like the fantasy of sleeping with a woman worth 200,000 yen."
"I don't feel that way at all," I replied.
"That's why I love you so much."
"You're a smooth talker."
"It's true. Even if I didn't have a penny to my name, you'd still come to see me, wouldn't you?"
With those words, she pulled me into an embrace.
But I couldn't shake the feeling that a bankbook for 200,000 yen was hidden somewhere against her skin, and I found myself unable to touch her.

**Truth or Fiction? The Dead Can Now Be Brought Back to Life**
Since time immemorial, humans have perhaps feared nothing more than death. Naturally, the ultimate goal of medicine has always been the quest for eternal youth and longevity—a pursuit that remains constant across all cultures and eras. Yet, this goal has remained elusive. Left with no choice but to rely on divine intervention, humans developed religion to face death with peace of mind, projecting the "life" of this world into the next as a substitute for immortality.
Now, however, humanity has shifted its efforts from trying not to die to succeeding in a method of returning to life after death. If this is true, people in the future might be able to die multiple times. Imagine a casual conversation: "How many times has this person died?" "This is their third time."
Dr. Hyman, an American physician, recently announced that using an artificial heart stimulator he invented, even a person who has passed away can be successfully resuscitated. According to the doctor, even after a physician declares "it is the end," the heart does not stop instantly; it takes 16 minutes and 10 seconds to become completely non-functional. The first 90 seconds are ideal for intervention. By piercing the heart with a 19-karat gold needle and passing a 1/1000th-volt current through a four-to-five-inch gold wire, the electrical energy can restart the heart's rhythm. With the additional application of a special cooling drug, the patient can be fully revived. Dr. Hyman claims he has already successfully resuscitated twelve people.
One person who was brought back to life described the experience: "I was floating softly in a gentle darkness. It was incredibly pleasant. There was only great peace and total satisfaction." They even added, "If death is that enjoyable, I'd like to die many more times."
At this rate, it might be better to die once or twice and come back than to never die at all.

**What About Women?**
*(1) Why Are Their Buttocks Large?*
Overhearing the question "Why do women have such large buttocks?", young Mi-chan shouted with a playful laugh, "It's because they eat so many sweet potatoes!" However, Mi-chan's own buttocks aren't nearly as large as her older sister's.
According to a theory from some archaeologists, women's buttocks became large after Eve ate the fruit of wisdom from the snake in the Garden of Eden. It is said that at the very moment she thought, "This is delicious," she was overcome by a sense of shame, and at that same instant, her buttocks suddenly puffed out.

*(2) Why No Beards?*
Beards, it seems, are quite a hindrance to kissing. In the West, it is customary for men to shave their faces perfectly smooth every morning and evening. This is reportedly out of courtesy, to ensure their partners don't find the experience unpleasant. However, "having no beard" is a relative term; even women have some facial hair, after all.

**Jokes**
*Love Seat*
Husband: "Young people these days seem to actually enjoy crowded trains."
Wife: "Oh? Why is that?"
Husband: "Because it gives them an excuse to sit on each other's laps."
Wife: "..."

*Exposed*
Young Man: "You know, miss, I'm truly a 'decadent' soul. But you understand the purity of my heart, don't you?"
Young Lady: "Oh, I understand perfectly. Mr. Murata's daughter mentioned it too—she said your 'pure heart' was just a line you used to trick her."
Young Man: "?"

*Oh, My*
Mother: "In my day, when I was your age..."
Daughter: "I know, I know—you're going to say you didn't even know what 'romance' was."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The page is structured into several distinct blocks. The top third features a short story ("The 200,000 Yen Woman"). The middle section is dominated by a sensational "scientific" feature about resurrection, highlighted by large, stylized vertical text. The right column contains trivia about women, and the bottom features a "Jokes" (笑話) section with small illustrations.
*   **Typography:** The text uses traditional vertical layout (*tategaki*). The headline for the resurrection article uses hand-drawn, energetic characters to draw the reader's eye, typical of pulp magazines of the era.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The resurrection headline is the largest, suggesting it is the "hook" of the page. The use of borders around different sections helps organize the disparate content types.
*   **Illustrations:** Simple line drawings accompany the jokes, adding a lighthearted visual element to the bottom of the page.
*   **Condition:** The paper shows significant yellowing and some ink bleed, consistent with cheap "pulp" paper used in mass-market magazines from the mid-20th century.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era:** This text likely dates from the late 1940s or very early 1950s (Showa 20s). The use of the old kanji for yen (圓), the term "pan-pan" (prostitutes catering to GIs), and the mix of archaic and modern orthography are key indicators.
*   **Pan-pan (パンパン):** A term for street prostitutes in the immediate post-war period. The story about the "200,000 Yen Woman" reflects the economic desperation of the time, where such a sum was a life-changing fortune.
*   **Western Influence:** There is a clear fascination with Western (specifically American) science and culture, evidenced by the mention of Dr. Hyman and Western shaving habits. Post-war Japan was deeply interested in anything seen as modern or scientifically advanced from the West.
*   **Social Mores:** The jokes touch on the transition from traditional, perhaps more reserved social interactions to the concept of "romance" (*ren-ai*), which was becoming a buzzword for the younger generation.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **二十万圓 (Nijuman-en):** 200,000 yen. Written with the older kanji for Yen.
*   **パンパン (Pan-pan):** Slang for a prostitute associated with the Allied Occupation.
*   **不老長寿 (Furo-choju):** Perpetual youth and longevity; a classic theme in East Asian medicine and folklore.
*   **蘇生 (Sosei):** Resuscitation or resuscitation; a technical term used here in a sensationalist context.
*   **刺戟器 (Shigekki):** Stimulator. Note the older kanji for stimulus (刺戟).
*   **頽廃的 (Taihaiteki):** Decadent. A popular term in post-war intellectual and youth circles to describe a rejection of traditional morals.
*   **口車 (Kuchiguruma):** Sweet talk or smooth talk; often used with "to be taken in" (*noseraru*).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Economic Anxiety:** The first story highlights how money (or the rumor of it) changes social dynamics and perceptions in a poverty-stricken society.
*   **Miracle Science:** The resurrection article reflects a post-war optimism—or perhaps a desperate hope—that science could solve even the ultimate human problem (death). It frames death not as a tragedy, but as a "pleasant experience" that one might even want to repeat.
*   **Gender and the "Other":** The "What About Women?" section treats female biology and behavior as a series of humorous or mythological curiosities, reflecting a male-centric editorial perspective common in men's pulp magazines.
*   **Generational Friction:** The jokes reflect a changing Japan where "pure" young men are seen as smooth talkers and "love" is a new, perhaps misunderstood, concept for older generations.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Short Fiction, Popular Science/Sensational News, Trivia, Humor/Jokes.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Occupation culture, medical miracles, gender stereotypes, economic struggle, westernization.
