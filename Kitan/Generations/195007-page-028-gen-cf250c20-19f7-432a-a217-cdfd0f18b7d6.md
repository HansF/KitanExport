　やがて人民裁判が始まった、吊しあげられたのはアブドラであった。
　しかし此處は南方である。吊し上げといっても仲々のんびりしたもので、さつきアハマとイマムが地團駄をふんだ部屋に汚い机が置かれ、正面にイマム、アハマ、ドクトル、アブドラの四人が、しかつめらしい顔をして座つている。
　サイダー瓶につめた椰子酒が二本と勇ましい槍を口先にくつつけた変な魚の丸焼きが、大きな皿に盛つてある。酒は一本三十銭で、始めて飲む者は、ちよつと鼻をつまゝないと咽喉を通らないという代物であるが、廻るとは素晴らしく、相当強い男でも一本やつたら足をとられてしまう。魚は跪いて十四六銭というただみたいな値で、ついのこの家のうしろで引き網をえらば、群をなしてくるから一度に五六千以上一万匹くらいわけなく獲れる。
　仕事をしないことゝ酒と女の好きなことを自慢にしているアハマが先づ注がれた酒をごくりと飲み、魚をつまんで、口先の槍を噛み切り、ペツと鮮やかに二間程吹き飛ばしてから食べにかかつた。イマムが次にコップを唇に持つて行くと、ドクトルは、先つきの怪物の匂いが残つていやしないかと、ちよつと指先を嗅いでみてからコップをとり上げた。アブドラは凝とかしこまつていた。
「どうだ、トアン・ドクトル、療るにや幾日かかる」
「さあ、深さが五分ぐらいで、切り口が約二寸だから、長くて半月でしょう。しかし動いぢやいかん」
　すると、アハマが、にや／＼してドクトルの顔をみつめ
「じゃあ、その傷の大きさつてのは、まるで、あれと同じじやないか――よく見分けがついたもんだな、どつちがほんとの傷やら」
「そんなことが分らんでドクトルができるかよ、しかし、うまくつたもんで、ほんものとにせものが仲良く並んでやがるんだ、たまげたね」
「ほう――」
　イマムが、恰も眼前に二つの傷口を示されたように顔をしかめた。
　アハマはにやりとしてアブドラの顔を盗み見た。イマムは邪念でも拂うように頭を振って
「さて、そのいきさつだか、おい、アブドラよ、眞直ぐに申してみい」
　アブドラは、おど／＼した眼をしばつかせてイマムの顔を見返えし、いまし＼／そうに言った。
「あそこさえ切りや、もう浮気はしねえと思つたからさあ」
「そりや分つとる、そう思うようになつた動機が聞きたいんだ」
　アブドラはゴクリと唾を飲んだ。
「まあ聞いて下さい、あつしは、なにも、悪いことはしてません」
と、先づ自分の身を護つてから、針小棒大に語り出した。
「あつしや御存知の通り、週に二度は必ず市場に出す乾魚を買い出しに、向うの島まで行きます。日帰りが出来ないから、当然どつかで泊らなけりやなりません。
　その留守を狙つて娘が男を喰わえこんだんでさあ、そりやもうあんなボチヤ／＼した愛くるしい女つてもなあ、そうざらにありません。
　あつしだつて、つまり、その、言い寄つた仲間ひとりなんですが、あつしが知つてるだけでも十人はあつたでしょう、そいつらを押しのけてとう／＼虜にしてしまつたんです。
　だから鼻高々で、憎らしいなんてたまあ、鼻毛のほこりほども思つたことはありません。
　しかし結婚前はとにかく、れつきとした亭主を持つたなら、そういつまでも男狂いされちや、あつしだつて少しも面白くありません」

（挿絵：僧侶イマム）

**III**

Eventually the People's Trial started. The one being hauled up was Abdullah.
However, this place is the South. Even saying "hauling up," it was quite a relaxed thing; in the room where earlier Ahamad and Imam had stamped their feet in frustration, a dirty desk was placed. In front, Imam, Ahamad, the Doctor, and Abdullah—these four people—were sitting with solemn faces.
Two cider bottles filled with palm wine and a whole roasted strange fish with a brave spear attached to its snout were served on a large plate. The wine was 30 sen per bottle; for a first-time drinker, it is the kind of stuff that won't pass through the throat unless one pinches the nose a little, but the way it goes to the head is wonderful; even a considerably strong man, if he does one bottle, will lose his feet. The fish is a price like free at 14 or 16 sen... behind this very house, if one casts a dragnet, because they come in schools, 5,000 to 6,000 or even 10,000 can be caught without difficulty.
Ahamad, who boasts of not working and liking wine and women, first gulped down the poured wine, pinched the fish, bit off the snout's spear, and with a "pui," brilliantly blew it away about two *ken* before starting to eat. When Imam next took the cup to his lips, the Doctor, wondering if the smell of the monster from earlier remained, sniffed his fingertips a little before picking up the cup. Abdullah was sitting stiffly and still.
"How is it, Tuan Doctor, how many days to heal?"
"Well, the depth is about 5 *bu*, and the cut is about 2 *sun*, so at longest, it will be half a month. However, you must not move."
Then, Ahamad, grinning, stared at the Doctor's face.
"Then, the size of that wound, isn't it exactly the same as *that*? You really could tell them apart—which one is the real wound."
"How could I be a doctor if I couldn't tell that? However, it was skillfully made; the real one and the fake one are lying side by side nicely, I was amazed."
"Ho—"
Imam grimaced as if two wound openings were being shown right before his eyes.
Ahamad smirked and stole a glance at Abdullah's face. Imam shook his head as if brushing away impure thoughts.
"Now, about that sequence of events... Hey, Abdullah, speak it straight."
Abdullah, blinking his timid eyes, looked back at Imam's face and said as if annoyed:
"I thought if I just cut *that* part, she wouldn't cheat anymore."
"That, I understand. I want to hear the motive that made you think so."
Abdullah gulped his saliva.
"Well, please listen. I haven't done anything bad," he said, first protecting himself, and then began to speak with great exaggeration.
"As you know, twice a week I always go to the opposite island to buy dried fish to put in the market. Since I can't return the same day, naturally I have to stay somewhere.
Taking advantage of my absence, my girl took a man in. Well, a plump, lovely woman like that, there aren't many around.
Even I, in short, was one of the group that wooed her, but of those I know, there must have been ten. I pushed them aside and finally made her mine.
So I was proud, and I never thought her hateful, not even as much as a speck of dust on a nose hair.
But, regardless of before marriage, once she has a proper husband, if she keeps going crazy over men like that forever, even I won't find it the least bit interesting."

**Part III**

Before long, the "People’s Trial" commenced. The man in the hot seat was Abdullah. 
However, this was the South Seas. Despite the gravity of a "trial," the atmosphere was oddly laid-back. In the same room where Ahamad and Imam had recently been stomping about in a rage, a grimy desk had been set out. Seated around it with forced solemnity were the four of them: Imam, Ahamad, the Doctor, and Abdullah.

On the table sat two cider bottles filled with palm wine and a large platter holding a whole roasted fish—a peculiar creature with a formidable, spear-like snout. The wine cost thirty sen a bottle. It was the sort of rotgut that a novice couldn't even swallow without pinching their nose, yet it packed a tremendous punch; even the heartiest drinker would find his legs giving out after a single bottle. The fish was cheap as dirt—fourteen or sixteen sen—since they could be hauled in by the thousands just by casting a net in the waters behind the house.

Ahamad, a man who prided himself on his idleness and his love for booze and women, was the first to take a gulp. He plucked up the fish, bit off its jagged snout, spat it out a good twelve feet with practiced precision, and began to eat. As Imam reached for his cup, the Doctor paused to sniff his own fingertips, checking for any lingering stench of the "monster" they had dealt with earlier, before finally taking a drink. Abdullah sat there, rigid and silent.

"So, Tuan Doctor," Ahamad asked, "how many days until it heals?"
"Well," the Doctor replied, "it’s about half an inch deep and two inches long. It should take two weeks at most, provided he stays still."
Ahamad gave the Doctor a knowing smirk. "So, the size of that wound... it’s a perfect match for the *other* one, isn't it? I’m impressed you could tell which was which."
"I wouldn't be much of a doctor if I couldn't," the Doctor shot back. "But I have to admit, it was a tidy piece of work. The real one and the imitation were lined up so neatly side-by-side it quite took me aback."
"Is that so..." Imam groaned, grimacing as if the two wounds were being brandished right under his nose.

Ahamad glanced mockingly at Abdullah. Imam shook his head, as if trying to clear away some unsavory mental image.
"Now then, regarding the circumstances... Come on, Abdullah, tell us the truth."
Abdullah blinked his nervous eyes, looked Imam in the face, and spoke with a touch of resentment.
"I just figured if I cut *that* part off, she wouldn’t be able to cheat anymore."
"We know *what* you did," Imam sighed. "What I want to hear is the motive—what drove you to it?"

Abdullah swallowed hard. "Now, listen here... I haven't done anything wrong," he began, instinctively defensive before launching into a grand, exaggerated tale.
"As you all know, twice a week I head over to the neighboring island to buy dried fish for the market. Since it's too far for a day trip, I’m forced to spend the night there. While I was away, my girl went and took in another man. Now, you won't find many women as soft and lovely as her; she's a real prize. I was just one of many suitors—at least ten that I know of—but I pushed the others aside and finally won her heart. I was proud of her. I never held a grudge against her, not even a speck's worth. But whatever she did before we were wed is one thing; once a woman has a proper husband, she can't just go on chasing every man she sees. It’s hardly a laughing matter for me, you see."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Format & Layout
*   **Vertical Typesetting:** Standard for Japanese literature.
*   **Two-Column Structure:** The page is split into two main vertical blocks of text, a common layout for magazines of the era (like *All Read* or *Bungei Shunju*).
*   **Illustrations:** Two hand-drawn illustrations are integrated into the text.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The section begins with a bolded Roman numeral "三" (Three), indicating a chapter break. The character names for the illustrations are placed beside the drawings ("僧侶イマム" - Monk Imam).

### Typography
*   **Kanji/Kana Balance:** Uses a mix of standard Joyo-like kanji and some older forms (e.g., 處 for 処, 眞 for 真).
*   **Punctuation:** Includes the use of "iterative marks" (々) and double dashes for emphasis or pauses in speech.
*   **Orthography:** Mostly modern kana usage (post-1946 reform), suggesting a publication date in the late 40s or 50s.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### The "South Seas" (Nan'yō) Setting
The text refers to the location as "南方" (Nanpō - The South). In the early-to-mid 20th century, this specifically referred to Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, etc.) and the Pacific Islands. This was a popular setting for "adventure" or "colonial" literature in Japan.

### Characters & Names
*   **Abdullah (アブドラ):** A common Muslim name, suggesting a setting like Indonesia or Malaysia.
*   **Imam (イマム):** A title for an Islamic prayer leader. In the story, he seems to be acting as a communal judge.
*   **Tuan (トアン):** A Malay/Indonesian honorific meaning "Sir" or "Mister." The Doctor is addressed as "Tuan Doctor."
*   **Ahamad (アハマ):** Another common Muslim name.

### People's Trial (人民裁判)
The term "Jinmin Saiban" (People's Trial) carries heavy connotations of the immediate post-war period and the influence of socialist/communist movements, or perhaps a localized form of tribal/communal justice in the absence of a formal colonial or state legal system.

### Social Context: Adultery and Honor
The plot revolves around domestic conflict—specifically, a husband (Abdullah) who has seemingly committed an act of violence (implied genital mutilation or a related wound) to prevent his "lovely" wife from cheating while he is away on business. This reflects period-specific attitudes toward gender, fidelity, and "frontier" justice.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **吊し上げ (Tsurushi-age):** Literally "hanging up." Idiomatically refers to a public denunciation or being put on the "hot seat" during a trial or meeting.
*   **地団駄をふむ (Jidanda o fumu):** To stamp one's feet in frustration or rage.
*   **しかつめらしい (Shikatsumerashii):** Solemn, serious, or stiff-faced.
*   **針小棒大 (Shinsho-bodai):** An idiom meaning "to make a mountain out of a molehill" or to speak with great exaggeration (literally: "needle-small, pole-large").
*   **男狂い (Otoko-gurui):** Being "man-crazy" or promiscuous (an archaic and derogatory term).
*   **二間 (Ni-ken):** A traditional unit of measurement. One *ken* is roughly 1.8 meters, so *ni-ken* is about 3.6 meters (12 feet).
*   **銭 (Sen):** A subunit of the Yen (100 sen = 1 yen). The prices (30 sen, 14 sen) date the story to a time when the yen had significantly more value than today.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Masculinity and Possession:** Abdullah views his wife as a "prize" he won over ten other men. His violence is framed as a desperate, albeit extreme, attempt to maintain "ownership" and "interest" in the marriage.
*   **Colonial/Occupational Languor:** The "relaxed" nature of the trial despite the violent subject matter suggests a setting where life is cheap or where the heat of the "South" dictates a slower pace of social management.
*   **The "Othering" of the South:** The description of the fish as "strange" and the wine as "foul-smelling rotgut" that "knocks you out" reinforces a common Japanese literary trope of the South Seas as a place of primitive, powerful, and exotic sensations.
*   **Medical vs. Moral Authority:** The Doctor provides the physical evidence of the wound, while the Imam provides the moral/religious framework for the trial.
