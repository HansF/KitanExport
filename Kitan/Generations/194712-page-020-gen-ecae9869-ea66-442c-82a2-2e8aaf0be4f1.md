私は若い時に或る事情からストリップ劇場に
勤めました。二度と想い出したくない昔です
が、今、貴誌を読みますと、ふっとあの頃が
想い出されて、居た堪れない気持ちになりま
す。私の様な女は、日本国中の処に沢山居る
ことと想います。それ等の女たちの為にも、
貴誌は、今後共、真面目に斯う云う処の世界
を扱って下さる様お願いします。
私は十六の年に入りました。入る前に一応
検診を受けたのですが、私は初潮が十八と遅
かったので、身体的には未熟で、乳房も膨れ
切っていませんでした。それが舞台で踊るに
つれて、めきめきと発育し、三ヶ月目に急に
初潮が来たのです。
それから私は女となり、男を愛し、男を憎み、
又、男に愛され、男に憎まれ、遂に、世間並
に落着くことは出来ませんでした。
私が居た劇団では、踊り子は皆、ストリッ
プが終わると、楽屋へ帰らずに、客席の入口
へ行って、お客と直接に交渉して、金を取る
のです。勿論、これには劇場の支配人が一枚
噛んでいるのですが、踊り子を人間として扱
わぬ、斯う云う制度は、私にとっては、地獄
の様なものでありました。

## Literal English Translation
When I was young, due to certain circumstances, I worked at a strip theater.
It is a past I never want to recall again,
but now, when I read your esteemed magazine, that time suddenly comes to
mind, and I feel unbearable distress.
Women like me, I believe, are numerous throughout all of Japan.
For the sake of those women too,
I ask that your esteemed magazine continue to seriously deal with the world
of places such as this in the future.
I entered [the profession] at the age of sixteen. Before entering, I received
a physical examination, but because my menarche was late, at eighteen,
I was physically immature, and my breasts had not fully swelled up.
However, as I danced on stage, they rapidly developed, and suddenly, my
menarche arrived three months later.
Since then, I became a woman. I loved men, I hated men,
and conversely, I was loved by men, and hated by men, and ultimately, I could
not settle down in a manner befitting ordinary society.
In the troupe I belonged to, all the dancers, when the strip show
finished, did not return to the dressing room, but went to the entrance
of the audience seating, directly negotiated with the customers, and took money.
Of course, the theater manager was also involved in this, but this kind of system,
which did not treat the dancers as human beings,
was like a hell to me.

## Literary English Translation
When I was young, certain circumstances forced me into employment at a strip theater.
It is a past I desperately wish to forget,
but reading your esteemed publication now, those days suddenly rush back, filling me with
unbearable anguish.
I believe there are countless women like me scattered across the country.
For the sake of those women, too,
I sincerely ask that your magazine continue its earnest coverage of the world found in places such as this.
I started when I was sixteen. I underwent a physical examination beforehand, but since my first period didn't arrive until I was eighteen, I was physically undeveloped, and my breasts had not yet fully matured.
However, as I danced on the stage, I matured strikingly fast, and my menarche suddenly arrived just three months later.
From that moment on, I became a woman. I loved men, I hated them,
and in turn, I was loved and hated by men, and ultimately, I could never achieve a stable, respectable life in ordinary society.
In the troupe I was with, after the strip performance concluded, all the dancers did not return to the dressing room. Instead, they proceeded to the entrance of the audience seating to directly negotiate with customers and collect money.
Naturally, the theater manager was deeply complicit in this arrangement, but for me, this entire system, which refused to treat the dancers as human beings, was nothing short of hell.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Submission / Confession Letter (読者の手記). This format is characteristic of *Kitan Club*'s focus on documenting marginalized sexual and social experiences.
*   **Author Attribution:** Anonymous female, self-identifying as a former strip dancer (踊り子). The tone is reflective and deeply confessional.
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** Entirely the narrator’s voice. The address to the magazine ("貴誌") is a formal plea for validation and continued serious coverage.
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in the hidden, often exploitative, sociology of the entertainment/sex industry (ero-guro subgenre) and the suffering of the "fallen woman."
*   **Positioning within the magazine:** Likely part of a recurring "Confessions" column aimed at shocking or informing the reader about societal taboos while positioning the magazine as a necessary critical archive.

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Strip Theater Context (ストリップ劇場):** In post-WWII Japan (Showa era), strip theaters flourished. While ostensibly venues for performance, the text confirms the common reality that they often functioned as fronts for *bai-shun* (prostitution), where sexual acts (often known euphemistically as *tokushu*) were arranged immediately after the stage performance.
*   **"Certain Circumstances" (或る事情):** A standard literary device of the era to signify socio-economic duress, typically poverty or family debt, forcing a young woman into sex work.
*   **Age and Maturity (十六の年, 初潮が十八):** The detail that she entered the profession at 16 but had not yet had her period (which arrived late, at 18) and was physically immature heightens the sense of tragedy and exploitation. The rapid physical development due to the profession suggests the job itself catalyzed her unwelcome, premature sexual maturity.
*   **Negotiation (交渉して、金を取る):** This describes the formalized system of organized prostitution within the theater premises, distinguishing it from independent street work.
*   **Manager Complicity (支配人が一枚噛んでいる):** The term *ichimai kande iru* confirms the manager's deep, profitable involvement in the prostitution revenue, illustrating the institutional nature of the exploitation and wage theft.
*   **Postwar Morality:** The inability to return to "ordinary society" (世間並に落着く) speaks to the deep, lingering social stigma of sex work, which permanently damaged a woman’s reputation and marital prospects, despite the widespread existence of the industry.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **ストリップ劇場 (sutorippu gekijō):** Strip theater. A venue where professional dancers performed full nudity, often requiring supplemental sexual services afterwards.
*   **或る事情 (aru jijō):** Euphemism for compelling economic necessity or coercion.
*   **居た堪れない (itama-renai):** Used in the original kana (居た堪れない). Means unbearable, distressful, or mortified.
*   **初潮 (shochō):** Menarche; first menstruation. A critical marker of female maturity, used here to measure physical vulnerability.
*   **めきめきと発育し (mekimeki to hatsuiku shi):** Developed rapidly/strikingly. Suggests a forceful, unnatural acceleration of puberty.
*   **踊り子 (odoriko):** Dancer/Stripper.
*   **一枚噛んでいる (ichimai kande iru):** Idiom meaning "to be complicit in a scheme" or "to have a stake in the profits."
*   **世間並に落着く (seken-nami ni ochitsuku):** To settle down into a respectable, conventional societal life (i.e., marriage and family).

## Themes & Subtext
*   **Ritualized Exploitation:** The process—medical inspection, lack of maturity, rapid physical development on stage, and the mandatory transition from performance to negotiation—functions as a degrading rite of passage.
*   **The Price of Womanhood:** The text equates the narrator's arrival into "womanhood" (女となり) with profound emotional and relational trauma (loving/hating men, being loved/hated by men). Her sexual identity is forged in exploitation.
*   **Appeal for Witnessing:** The plea to the magazine is a core trope of ero-guro confessions: the marginalized subject demands that her suffering be documented and validated by a public forum, granting her agency through her trauma narrative.
*   **Anti-Establishment Critique:** The critique is aimed squarely at the "system" (制度) and the "manager" (支配人), highlighting the financial and structural mechanisms that dehumanize the dancers.

## Content Classification Tags
*   Sexual content: High (Explicit discussion of institutional prostitution/sex work).
*   Violence: Low (Focus on psychological and systemic coercion, not physical violence).
*   Coercion: High (Describes mandatory post-show sexual services dictated by management).
*   Medical / bodily themes: Medium (Discussion of physical exam, puberty, and menarche).
*   Taboo or illegal implications: High (Operation of a prostitution ring under the guise of entertainment).
