### （一）日本自由演劇社俳優養成所の乱脈

**若人の夢**

　終戦の翌年の事であった。京都市左京区鞍馬に三階建のビルを擁する日本自由演劇社、同俳優養成所が創立された。此処は地理的にも大映の太秦、松竹の下加茂両撮影所に近く、併ば養成の記事が朝日、毎日の両新聞に掲載されるや、志願者は千数百名の圧倒的な数に上ったのである。永い戦争で荒れ果てた青少年の取扱した夢と理想は案外甘いものだった。
　こうして戦後第一陣をうけたまわった、同俳優養成所はその出発に於ける華々しさに引かえ、約半年後の同年六月分襲解散のうきめに会ったのだが、その主要なる原因を、新聞紙上では経済上の基盤が弱体であった為と発表されていたが、真相は同社社長唄村道夫氏（四三）の淫獣にも等しい行動が同俳優養成所女生徒に対し喇叭を起こさせたからであった。
　以下は当時同社の生徒課に勤務していた吉村治郎氏（仮名）に訊ねたものである。
　同演劇俳優養成所設立の趣旨は至極真面目なものであった。過去のドサ廻り芝居や新派歌舞伎世界の持つ因習の打破と同時に世に埋もれたる真摯なる演劇人の発見と育成を題目に旗あげ。新劇演出家、多田俊平、宝塚歌劇団演出家、堀正旗、日本舞踊家、藤茂都陸平、京大教授大山定一、山本修二外に津村左近の両西洋舞踊家を講師として迎え、現在のインチキ短期大学など到底足もともえも寄れぬ豪華メンバーで、教授内容も、俳優受学、演出学、メイキャップ法、教養学科、演技実習等、俳優に必要な凡ての学科を毎日午前八時より午後四時まで、六カ月間の厳しいものだった。
　千数百名の中より再度にわたって実施された厳正なる審査の結果第一期生として男子五十名女子四十八名の入学が許可された。月謝、入会金等は一切不要、卒業のあかつきは同社専属芸能員として給料まで支給される特典があり、研究生達は前途洋々たる希望に胸膨らませて訓練に熱中、技術の修得に余念がなかった。この表面、何事もない平和な演劇学園にも、そろそろ好色の毒牙が迫っていたのである。

**好色魔社長**

　同演劇社、社長兼養成所長の唄村道夫は終戦成金で其の財数千万円を所有すると騒され、大阪郊外枚方市に豪華な別荘を所有する実業家で、もとく関係の仕事に興味を抱いていた折しも、前記講師の一部の方から出資の相談をもちかけられ、百万円出資、社長の椅子に坐ったのだったが社長唄村の本心は講師連の演劇の理想などどうでもよかった。外の事業では到底真似の出来ぬ、役得が当然あるものと計算の上だった。役得とは？
　同養成所女生徒の貞操をかたっぱしから毒いとる事である。

# Exposing the Reality
### (1) The Chaos of the Japan Free Theater Company Actor Training School

**Dreams of Youth**

It was the year after the end of the war. In Kyoto City, Sakyo-ku, Kurama, possessing a three-story building, the Japan Free Theater Company and its affiliated actor training school were founded. This place, geographically as well, was close to both Daiei's Uzumasa and Shochiku's Shimokamo studios, and as soon as articles about the training were published in the Asahi and Mainichi newspapers, applicants rose to an overwhelming number of over a thousand and several hundred. The dreams and ideals held by the youth, who were devastated by the long war, were unexpectedly sweet.
In this way, the training school, which received the first post-war wave, in contrast to the brilliance of its departure, met the misfortune of dissolution and disbandment about half a year later in June of the same year. The main cause was announced in newspapers as the economic foundation being weak, but the truth was that the beast-like behavior of the company president, Mr. Michio Utamura (43), toward the female students of the training school caused a stir.
The following is based on what was asked of Mr. Jiro Yoshimura (pseudonym), who was working in the student department of the company at that time.
The purpose of establishing the actor training school was extremely serious. With the discovery and cultivation of sincere theater people buried in the world, as well as the breaking of conventions held by the past's traveling shows and Shinpa Kabuki world as its slogan, it raised its banner. With Shingeki director Shumpei Tada, Takarazuka Revue director Masahata Hori, Japanese dancer Rikuhei Fujimoto, Kyoto University professor Teiichi Oyama, Shuji Yamamoto, and others, including both Western dancers such as Sakon Tsumura as instructors, it was a luxurious lineup that current bogus junior colleges could not even hope to match. Regarding the teaching content: actor study, directing theory, makeup methods, liberal arts, acting practice, etc.—all subjects necessary for an actor were conducted from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day, a strict six-month course.
As a result of a strict screening conducted twice from among more than a thousand people, 50 males and 48 females were permitted to enroll as the first class. There was a special privilege: tuition and admission fees were entirely unnecessary, and upon graduation, one would even be paid a salary as an exclusive entertainer for the company. The research students, their chests swelling with hope for a promising future, were absorbed in training, with no other thoughts than acquiring skills. On the surface of this peaceful theater academy where nothing seemed wrong, the poisonous fangs of lechery were gradually approaching.

**The Lust-Crazed President**

The president of the theater company and head of the training school, Michio Utamura, was a post-war nouveau riche, rumored to possess a fortune of tens of millions of yen. He was a businessman who owned a luxurious villa in Hirakata City, on the outskirts of Osaka. Just as he was harboring an interest in entertainment-related work, he was approached with a consultation about investment from some of the aforementioned instructors. He invested one million yen and sat in the president's chair, but President Utamura's true heart did not care at all about the theater ideals of the instructors. Based on his calculations, there were "fringe benefits" that absolutely could not be imitated in other businesses. What were the fringe benefits?
It was to snatch away the chastity of the training school's female students one by one.
Suppose now he were to redeem one geisha; it would cost over a hundred thousand yen. No, even as a "mizuage" (deflowering) fee, twenty to thirty thousand yen would be taken per person. Furthermore, professionals cannot be trusted, and for him, who was tired of playing in the pleasure quarters, he wanted to taste to his heart's content the bodies of pure and innocent virgins rather than professional bodies. Beautiful girls with fresh, firm breasts. Because they were handpicked from among more than a thousand, everyone had their own charms. What should be done but to not let this slip away? If he "mowed them all down," an investment of one million yen would by no means be high. He secretly muttered this in his gut, licking his lips and waiting for the time to come.
No tuition, no admission fee, a first-rate instructor lineup, and a guarantee of livelihood. Since these conditions were all met, even people in the entertainment world took notice of the emerging company, Free Theater Company, and it is no wonder that the guardians of the research students held absolute trust in President Michio Utamura.
However, a delicate problem lay here. That was, among the applicants from rural areas, there were 16 females and 5 males who absolutely could not study unless they stayed in a boarding house or were allowed into the training school's dormitory. The instructors who were judges, as a rule, usually...

# Exposing the Truth
### Part 1: Depravity at the Japan Free Theater Training School

**The Dreams of Youth**

It was the year following the end of the war. In the Kurama district of Kyoto’s Sakyo Ward, the Japan Free Theater Company and its affiliated actor training school were established, housed in a grand three-story building. Its location was ideal, situated near the major film studios—Daiei’s Uzumasa and Shochiku’s Shimokamo. As soon as news of the school’s opening hit the *Asahi* and *Mainichi* newspapers, a staggering wave of over a thousand applicants rushed to apply. To the youth of Japan, whose spirits had been ravaged by years of war, the dreams and ideals of the stage seemed like a sweet, intoxicating escape.

Yet, despite this brilliant beginning, the school met a tragic end just six months later in June, when it was abruptly disbanded. While the newspapers cited a weak financial foundation as the cause, the grim reality was far more scandalous: the beastly, predatory behavior of the company’s president, 43-year-old Michio Utamura, toward his female students had finally ignited a firestorm of controversy.

The following account comes from Jiro Yoshimura (a pseudonym), who worked in the school’s student affairs department at the time.

Originally, the school’s mission was noble. It sought to break the stagnant conventions of traveling troupes and traditional *Shinpa* theater, aiming instead to discover and nurture genuine talent hidden from the world. The faculty was a "dream team" that would put today’s fraudulent junior colleges to shame, featuring luminaries like Shingeki director Shumpei Tada, Takarazuka's Masahata Hori, and Kyoto University professor Teiichi Oyama. The curriculum was rigorous: six months of daily classes from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM covering everything from acting theory and directing to stage makeup and liberal arts.

From the thousands of hopefuls, a strict two-stage screening process selected the first class: 50 young men and 48 young women. The school offered incredible perks—no tuition or entrance fees, and a guaranteed salary as a company actor upon graduation. The students, their hearts brimming with hope for a bright future, threw themselves into their studies. But beneath the surface of this peaceful academy, the predatory fangs of lust were quietly closing in.

**The Satyr President**

The president and school director, Michio Utamura, was a "war profiteer" rumored to be worth tens of millions of yen. A businessman with a lavish villa in Hirakata, Osaka, he had long harbored a desire to enter the entertainment world. When he was approached by instructors seeking investment, he put up one million yen and took the president’s seat. However, Utamura cared nothing for the artistic ideals of his staff. He had calculated that this position offered "fringe benefits" that no other business could provide. And what were those benefits?

His goal was to systematically violate the chastity of every female student in the school.

Utamura reasoned that buying out a single geisha would cost over a hundred thousand yen, and even the "first night" rights for a novice would cost thirty thousand. Besides, he was bored of professionals. He craved the bodies of pure, innocent virgins. Having handpicked these beautiful girls from a pool of thousands, each one was a prize. "If I have my way with all of them," he thought, "a million-yen investment is a bargain." He licked his lips in anticipation, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

Given the free tuition, elite faculty, and promise of a career, it was only natural that the entertainment industry took notice and that parents placed their absolute trust in Utamura. However, a "delicate problem" soon emerged regarding out-of-town students. Sixteen girls and five boys required dormitory housing to attend. For Utamura, this was the opening he had been waiting for...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Format and Layout
*   **Publication Style:** The page is reminiscent of a mid-century "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine or a tabloid-style exposé journal. These publications often focused on scandals, "true" crime, and sexual deviancy under the guise of social reporting.
*   **Typography:**
    *   **Main Title:** "實態をつく" (Hitting the Reality) uses a large, bold, hand-drawn font style typical of sensationalist headlines.
    *   **Subtitles:** Use a slightly smaller but still prominent bold typeface.
    *   **Header:** "都会の魔術師" (Magician of the City) suggests this is part of a serialized column or a specific section of the magazine.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is the largest element, followed by the subheadings. The text is arranged in traditional vertical columns (*tate-gaki*). 
*   **Illustrations:** 
    *   The top illustration shows a man in a suit staring intently at a young woman, illustrating the predatory nature described in the text.
    *   The bottom illustration depicts the "President" figure surrounded by multiple women, visually reinforcing the theme of his "lustful" ambitions. The style is somewhat "gekiga-lite," typical of 1950s magazine illustration.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Era (1946-1950s):** The text mentions "the year after the war ended" (1946). This was a time of extreme poverty but also a desperate hunger for entertainment and "culture" as a form of escapism.
*   **War Profiteers (Sensou Narikin):** The president is described as a "Shuusen Narikin" (Post-war nouveau riche). This term refers to people who made fortunes in the chaos or black markets immediately following Japan's defeat, often looked upon with suspicion or disdain by the general public.
*   **The Entertainment Industry:** The mentions of **Daiei**, **Shochiku**, and **Takarazuka** anchor the story in the real-world geography of the Japanese film and theater industry centered in Kyoto (Uzumasa) at the time.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The article's tone is typical of "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, short-lived publications that flourished during the Occupation. They were known for 3-S content (Screen, Sex, Sport) and sensationalist exposés.
*   **Education Context:** The mention of "Inchiki Tanki Daigaku" (Bogus Junior Colleges) reflects the post-war educational reforms where many schools were hastily reorganized, sometimes with questionable standards.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **乱脈 (Ranmyaku):** Chaos, corruption, or lack of discipline. Often used to describe financial or moral decay.
*   **淫獣 (Injuu):** Literally "lustful beast" or "lecherous animal." A highly derogatory term for a sexual predator.
*   **ドサ廻り (Dosa-mawari):** Slang for a traveling theater troupe that tours rural areas, often considered low-brow or struggling.
*   **役得 (Yakitoku):** Fringe benefits or perks of a position. Here, it is used ironically to describe the president's intent to sexually exploit students.
*   **水揚げ (Mizuage):** Originally a term for unloading fish, in the "flower and willow world" (geisha districts), it referred to the "deflowering" of a young geisha-in-training by a patron for a large sum of money.
*   **なで斬り (Nadegiri):** To mow down or cut down everyone in one's path. Used here metaphorically for "violating all the students."
*   **玄人 (Kuroto) vs. 素人 (Shiroto):** "Professionals" (geisha/prostitutes) vs. "Amateurs" (innocent girls).

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Exploitation of Dreams:** The primary theme is the predatory nature of those in power taking advantage of the "dreams and ideals" of vulnerable young people in the post-war period.
*   **Class Resentment:** There is a clear subtext of resentment toward the "nouveau riche" (Utamura), depicting him as someone with money but no class, morals, or genuine interest in the arts.
*   **Gender and Power:** The text highlights the vulnerability of young women seeking careers in the arts, where their "chastity" (贞操) is seen as a commodity by powerful men.
*   **Moral Panic:** The article serves as a cautionary tale, warning parents and youth that "too good to be true" offers (no tuition, guaranteed salary) often hide a "poisonous fang."
