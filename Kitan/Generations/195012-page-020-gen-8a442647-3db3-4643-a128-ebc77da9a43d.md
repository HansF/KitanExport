と言いつつ、有田へ投げた明代の眼差しは、ただならぬ光が潜んでいた。
「有田さん、明代は私の妹なの……」
弥生は決めつけるように言った。
「そうかい、君の妹か……なあんだい、姉妹総ざめかいアハハ……」
有田はこともなげに笑った。
「それじゃ、あなたは？」
「明代さんとはホールで知り合って……言わぬが花かね……」
有田はにやにや笑いながら、舌を出して下唇をなめた。好色漢らしい貌（かお）を光らせている。
「明代、あんた、そんなことしていいの。有田は私の夫なのよ。姉さんの厄介になんかならないと言って飛び出しておきながら、なんてことするの……」
「私、恋愛にまでお姉さんに干渉されたくないわ。自由よ……男を作るのは女の腕よ」
反抗にぎらぎら眼を光らせて、明代はこう言いながら、有田の銀のケースへ手を伸ばし外国煙草をつまみ出して、傲然と煙を輪に吹いた。
「まあ、あんたは……」
弥生はいきなり猛然と明代へ挑みかかったが、その手をするりと避けて明代は部屋を飛び出してしまった。
「明代ちゃん、明代ちゃん……」
有田までが、続いて飛び出してしまった後、弥生は痴呆のようにちょっと部屋に座ったまま、暗い窓を見つめていた。妹への敗北感がひしひしと胸を締め付ける。
そんな弥生の心にふと明るい気がきらめいた。それは玉置の存在である。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

While saying [this], the gaze Akiyo threw toward Arita had an unusual light hidden in it.
"Arita-san, Akiyo is my younger sister..."
Yayoi said in an assertive manner.
"Is that so, she's your sister... Well now, the whole sisterhood is a washout, aha..."
Arita laughed as if it were nothing.
"Then, what about you?"
"I met Akiyo-san at the [dance] hall... and well, silence is golden, right?"
While grinning, Arita stuck out his tongue and licked his lower lip, making his lecher-like face shine.
"Akiyo, you, is it okay to do such a thing? Arita is my husband. Even though you ran out saying you wouldn't be a burden to your sister, what on earth are you doing...?"
"I don't want to be interfered with by my sister, even in love. It's freedom... Making a man is a woman's skill."
With her eyes glittering in rebellion, while saying this, Akiyo reached out her hand to Arita's silver case, picked out a foreign cigarette, and haughtily blew smoke rings.
"My, you are..."
Yayoi suddenly and fiercely tried to challenge Akiyo, but slipping through those hands, Akiyo flew out of the room.
"Akiyo-chan, Akiyo-chan..."
After even Arita had subsequently flown out, Yayoi remained sitting in the room for a bit like an imbecile, staring at the dark window. A sense of defeat against her sister pierced and tightened her chest.
In such a heart of Yayoi, a bright feeling suddenly sparkled. That was the existence of Tamaki.
"That's right, let's go."
While saying a monologue to herself, Yayoi sat in front of the dressing table and fixed her messed-up makeup.

III

Heading there with great momentum, she came to Tamaki's apartment, but there too, Yayoi was made to taste the misery of defeat.
"Tamaki-san, are you there...?"
With a buoyantly bright face, inside the door she opened, there, an unspeakable scene of lewdness between Akiyo and Tamaki was being performed.
"Oh! My!"
She couldn't bear to look. Leaving such a cry behind, Yayoi dashed out of the room. In front of Arita, she was able to maintain her dignity as an older sister to some extent, but here, her chest was merely tightened by a sense of defeat from being thoroughly beaten down, and she didn't have the energy to say a single word.
Tamaki was supposed to be the lamp inside her heart. Although she thought he was the only partner who could satisfy her lust in the prime of womanhood and give her the joy of sex, even that was snatched away by Akiyo's youth.
Yayoi, while vaguely feeling the "autumn of the body," left the apartment entrance dejectedly. Left by Arita, and even by Tamaki... And that the rival, of all things, was her own blood-related sister... Yayoi shuddered at the fateful creaking sound of the gears of lust. She felt a solemn desire to enter a decent life as a woman.

IV

The apartment she returned to was chilly, and in her unfulfilled thoughts, Yayoi keenly tasted the desolation of loneliness. She wanted someone who would care for these feelings. While she was thinking such things,
"Madam..."
Matsuki from the "curtain" (accounts/bar staff) entered carrying a folding bag. Matsuki lined up today's earnings (mizuage) in front of Yayoi,
"It was very busy,"
he said while looking at Yayoi's face.
"I see,"
Yayoi said like it was someone else's business and let out a sigh.
"Madam, what's wrong? Sighing isn't like you, Madam."
"Hey, I've had my heart broken."
"Oh?"
"It's a pathetic sight... Setting that aside, Matsuki-san, can we eat (survive) on just the income from the 'Black Tanuki Bar'?"
"It's all up to your attitude, Madam."
"I see... You have confidence we can live on it..."
"Of course I do... Tonight, the Madam is strange..."
Matsuki put a cigarette in his mouth and flicked his lighter.
"I am serious..."
In Yayoi, there was a fierce thing that could not live without the stimulation of the opposite sex.
"Madam..."
"Don't call me Madam, I hate it..."
Yayoi thought that this time, she would live seriously for one man's love. It could not help but seem to her that Matsuki's embrace would bring her a woman's happiness.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

As she spoke, a strange glint flickered in Akiyo’s eyes as she glanced toward Arita.
“Arita-san, Akiyo is my sister...” Yayoi said, her voice firm and accusatory.
“Oh, she’s your sister? Well, what do you know—a whole set of sisters to ruin the mood. Ha!” Arita laughed callously. “And what about you, then?”
“I met Akiyo at the dance hall... but I suppose some things are better left unsaid.”
Arita smirked, licking his lower lip with a lecherous air that made his face shine with grease and greed.
“Akiyo! How could you?” Yayoi cried. “Arita is my husband. You walked out on me saying you didn’t want to be a burden, and now you do this?”
“I don’t need my big sister interfering in my love life,” Akiyo shot back. “I’m free. Winning a man is a test of a woman’s skill.”
Her eyes burning with defiance, Akiyo reached for Arita’s silver case, pulled out a foreign cigarette, and haughtily blew smoke rings into the air.
“Why, you little...!”
Yayoi lunged at her in a fit of rage, but Akiyo nimbly slipped past her and bolted from the room.
“Akiyo! Wait!”
Even Arita chased after her, leaving Yayoi alone. She sat there, stunned and hollow, staring out into the dark night. A crushing sense of defeat at the hands of her own sister weighed heavily on her heart.
Then, a small spark of hope flickered. There was still Tamaki.
“That’s it. I’ll go to him.”
Muttering to herself, Yayoi sat at her vanity and hurriedly touched up her ruined makeup.

III

Yayoi rushed to Tamaki’s apartment with desperate hope, only to be met with another bitter taste of humiliation.
“Tamaki? Are you there?”
She called out, her face bright with anticipation. But as the door swung open, she was confronted by the shameless, debauched sight of Akiyo and Tamaki together.
“Oh, god... no!”
Yayoi let out a sharp cry and fled. She had managed to keep some semblance of sisterly dignity in front of Arita, but here, the total wreckage of her pride left her speechless and broken.
Tamaki had been the light of her life—the only man she thought could satisfy her cravings and bring her true pleasure in the prime of her womanhood. Now, even he had been snatched away by Akiyo’s youth.
Feeling the metaphorical "autumn" of her fading beauty, Yayoi walked dejectedly out of the apartment building. First Arita, now Tamaki... and the rival was her own flesh and blood. Shuddering at the cruel, grinding gears of fate and desire, a sudden, earnest longing for a "decent" life took hold of her.

IV

Back at her own apartment, the air was cold and the silence of her loneliness was deafening. She yearned for someone—anyone—to comfort her. Just then, Matsuki, the bar manager, walked in with his briefcase. He laid out the day’s earnings from the bar in front of Yayoi.
“It was a busy night,” he said, looking at her.
“I see,” Yayoi replied distantly, letting out a long sigh.
“Madam, what is it? A sigh doesn’t suit you.”
“Matsuki... my heart’s been broken.”
“Is that so?”
“I’m a pathetic mess... Tell me, Matsuki, can we survive just on the income from the Black Tanuki?”
“That depends entirely on your resolve, Madam.”
“I see... So you think we can make it.”
“Of course. But you’re acting strange tonight.”
Matsuki put a cigarette to his lips and flicked his lighter.
“I’m serious,” she said. Yayoi was a woman who burned with a need for male attention; she couldn't live without it.
“Madam...”
“Don't call me 'Madam.' I hate it.”
This time, Yayoi decided she would live honestly for the love of one man. She convinced herself that Matsuki’s embrace was the only thing that could finally bring her happiness.
—THE END—

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The text is presented in a vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), characteristic of Japanese literature. It is divided into two main columns with a decorative scalloped border surrounding the page.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. It uses a mix of Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana. Small Katakana (like ッ) are used for emphasis or glottal stops in dialogue.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Section headers "三" (3) and "四" (4) are centered within the columns to indicate narrative breaks. The "—終—" (End) marker at the bottom right signals the conclusion of the story.
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing occupies the upper right of the second column. It depicts a woman (likely Yayoi) in profile, looking down at a table with a lamp, reinforcing the domestic/solitary setting of the final scene. The style is reminiscent of "B-grade" or popular magazine illustrations of the 1950s.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses traditional Japanese punctuation (commas, periods, quotation marks) but also employs ellipses (……) frequently to convey emotional lingering, a hallmark of melodramatic prose.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-war 1950s):** The language and themes suggest the mid-1950s. The mention of "Dance Halls" (*hōru*), "Madam" (bar owners), and "foreign cigarettes" points to the urban nightlife culture of the *kasutori* (pulp magazine) era or early post-war popular fiction.
*   **The "Madam" Archetype:** Yayoi is referred to as "Madam," a title given to women who ran bars or cabarets. These women were seen as financially independent but socially marginalized, often portrayed as world-weary and unlucky in love.
*   **Post-war Morality:** The conflict between the older sister (Yayoi) and younger sister (Akiyo) mirrors the generational shift after WWII. Akiyo represents the "New Woman" or "Apres-Guerre" (post-war) generation—bold, selfish, and emphasizing "freedom" and "individual skill" in romance, discarding traditional sisterly respect.
*   **Western Influence:** The presence of "foreign cigarettes" and "apartments" (then a modern, somewhat Westernized way of living compared to traditional houses) highlights the rapid Westernization of urban Japan.
*   **"Black Tanuki Bar":** The name of the bar (*Kuro-danuki*) is typical of the era—whimsical yet slightly shady.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **好色漢 (Kōshokukan):** A lecher or philanderer. It carries a strong nuance of someone who is driven by base lust.
*   **総ざめ (Sōzame):** A state where the mood is completely ruined or "chilled." Arita uses it to mock the fact that both sisters are involved with him.
*   **言わぬが花 (Iwanu ga hana):** An idiom meaning "silence is golden" or "some things are better left unsaid."
*   **狂態 (Kyōtai):** Scandalous or shameful behavior; often used in a sexual context in this era of literature.
*   **肉体の秋 (Nikutai no aki):** "Autumn of the body." A poetic/melodramatic way of saying a woman is past her physical prime or fading in beauty.
*   **水あげ (Mizuage):** Originally a term for a geisha's debut, here it refers to the daily cash earnings or "take" from a business like a bar.
*   **殊勝 (Shushō):** Admirable, serious, or commendable. Used here to describe Yayoi's sudden desire to turn over a new leaf.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Rivalry and Betrayal:** The central plot point is the "blood-related" betrayal. The fact that the younger sister steals both the "husband" and the "lover" highlights a theme of ruthless competition in the post-war social jungle.
*   **Fading Youth vs. Vibrant Youth:** Yayoi feels "defeated" because she cannot compete with Akiyo’s youth. This reflects the anxiety of women whose social currency was tied strictly to their age and beauty.
*   **Redemption through "Common" Love:** The ending suggests a trope common in "ladies' fiction": the weary woman of the night finds "true happiness" by settling for a "serious," plain man (Matsuki) who was right in front of her all along.
*   **Decadence and Despair:** The text uses words like "loneliness," "desolation," and "lecherous" to paint a picture of a hollow urban existence where pleasure is fleeting and relationships are transactional.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Popular Fiction, Short Story, Melodrama (*Fūzoku Shōsetsu*).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Romance, Sisterly Rivalry, Post-war Japan, Nightlife, Modernization, Betrayal, Redemption, Gender Roles.
*   **Tone:** Melodramatic, Cynical, Sentimental.
