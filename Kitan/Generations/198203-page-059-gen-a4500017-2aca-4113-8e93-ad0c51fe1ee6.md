**[Right Column Text]**
のよ。さァ、早くかえりましょう」と、いそいそと肩をならべるのだった。
食事中、僕の手が彼女の掌にふれる……とそのたびに媚びをふくんだあでやかな微笑をうかべて「まァ……」羞らいとともに、いそいでそのしなやかな手を引っこめるのだ。
夜は、疲れているので早く寝る。ときにはあまりの疲れに終日の垢や泥や汗を洗い落とすのもおっくうで、そのまま横になる。みつ子はそんなとき、いっそうやさしくしてくれた。いつまでも眼をあけており、香水の匂いのするタオルねまきの胸をわざときつくしめて「フフフフッ…」と忍び笑いをする。僕は木の根っこみたいに硬化し、豆だらけになったこの黒い手で、白いゴムのようなみつ子の肌にさわるのが可哀そうなので、じっとがまんしていた。
みつ子は、となりの部屋との境の襖のすき間からもれてくる灯にうっとりと、自分の手をかざして、かわいい顎を夜具の襟になかば埋めながら、じっと眺めていることもあった。
「あなたの手で、さわってごらんなさい…」
ときには惜しげもなく、小さな桜色の爪を僕の岩のような手にからめてくる。
じんわりと汗ばんだその両手は、僕の片方の掌にゆっくり包含されてしまう。
「その豆だらけな掌で、もっときつくにぎって……」
「こうかい？」
「そう……オモチャにして……」
「いいのかい？　痛いぞ」
「平気だわ……あなたの掌よ……この掌……かわいがってね…」
僕は気もそぞろになってつかめた。が、毎日汚らしくなって戻る男は、反比例して美しくなってゆく若い妻を、夜ごとに神聖なものを冒すような残虐性のまじる興味でささまざまに弄んだのだった。
しかも抱擁のさなか、彼女は興奮に息はずませながら、くりかえしくりかえし、
「このお仕事やめないでね……あたしたちの生活、これで充分なんですもの……」
などとささやく。
「いや、もう少し気のきいたインテリ向きの口をさがすつもりなんだが…」
というと、その白蠟のような両手で僕の指をいとしむようにやさしく撫でながら、
「いいのよ、このままが。もっと汚なくなって真っ黒になって……ザラザラになっていいのよ。そうして、あたしを……どんなにしてもいいのよ……ぶっても……いじめても……幸福なんですもの…」
胸をあえがせつつ口走るのだった。

## Literal English Translation

"...you know. Come now, let's go home quickly," she said, and eagerly aligned her shoulders with mine.
During the meal, whenever my hand touched her palm... she would float a charming smile full of flirtation, say "Oh my...", and with shyness, quickly withdraw her supple hand.
At night, because I am tired, I go to sleep early. Sometimes, due to excessive fatigue, washing off the day's grime, mud, and sweat is too troublesome, so I lie down just as I am. At such times, Mitsuko treated me even more gently. She would keep her eyes open for a long time, intentionally tighten the chest of her towel-cloth nightgown that smelled of perfume, and laugh stealthily, "Fufufufu..." Because I felt pity touching Mitsuko's skin—white like rubber—with these black hands of mine that had hardened like tree roots and become covered in blisters, I held back and stayed still.
Mitsuko would sometimes stare entranced at the light leaking from the gap in the *fusuma* sliding doors bordering the next room, holding up her own hand, while half-burying her cute chin in the collar of the bedding.
"Try touching me with your hands..."
Sometimes, without sparing anything, she entangles her small cherry-blossom-colored fingernails with my rock-like hands.
Those hands, damp with sweat, end up slowly encompassed within just one of my palms.
"With those blister-covered palms, squeeze tighter..."
"Like this?"
"Yes... make me a toy..."
"Is it okay? It will hurt."
"I don't mind... It's your palms... these palms... love me [with them]..."
I became distracted and grasped her. But, the man who returns everyday having become filthy, with an interest mixed with cruelty as if violating something holy night after night, toyed with his young wife who, inversely, was becoming more beautiful.
Furthermore, in the midst of our embrace, while panting with excitement, she whispers over and over again:
"Don't quit this job, okay... For our life, this is enough..."
"No, I intend to look for a position slightly more suited to an intellectual..."
When I say that, she strokes my fingers gently as if cherishing them with her white-wax-like hands,
"It's fine, just like this. Become dirtier, become pitch black... It's fine to become rough and coarse. And then, to me... you can do whatever you like... even if you hit me... even if you bully me... I am happy..."
She would blurt this out while her chest heaved.

**Fingers Creeping into Wife's Soft Skin**

I never dreamed that Mitsuko had such stimulating sexual propensities.
Since coming to be a dependent in this boss's house, suddenly, within the modest and elegant her, something obscene seems to have had an influence. I still did not understand what that was.

**[Character Introduction]**
**Boku (Me)** — Protagonist. An intellectual who graduated university, but due to the depression, is living day-to-day working as a navvy (manual laborer).
**Mitsuko** — My wife. An innocent young wife filled with fresh beauty, retaining the visage of a young girl, ignorant of the world.
**Oyakata (Boss)** — The master of the house where we, the couple, are renting a room.
**Oyuki-san** — The Boss's wife. Just past thirty, in the prime of her voluptuous womanhood. Likely has significant M [Masochistic] tendencies.

## Literary English Translation

"...you see. Come now, let's hurry home," she said, eagerly falling into step beside me.
During our meal, if my hand happened to brush against her palm... she would offer a bewitching, flirtatious smile, gasp "Oh my...", and shyly, swiftly withdraw her supple hand.
At night, exhausted, I retire early. Sometimes, worn down by the day's labor, I find it too troublesome to wash away the grime, mud, and sweat, so I lie down just as I am. In those moments, Mitsuko was even gentler than usual. She would lie awake, deliberately tightening the chest of her towel-cloth nightgown, perfumed and soft, while giggling a stealthy "Fufufufu..." My hands were black, hardened like tree roots and covered in calluses; I felt it would be pitiful to touch Mitsuko’s skin—white and resilient as rubber—with them, so I lay still and endured it.
Sometimes Mitsuko would gaze entranced at the light leaking through the crack in the *fusuma* doors from the next room, holding up her hand against it, her cute chin half-buried in the collar of the futon.
"Go on, touch me with your hands..."
At times, unreservedly, she would twine her small, cherry-blossom pink fingernails around my rock-hard hands.
Her hands, damp with a gentle sweat, would be slowly swallowed up by just one of my palms.
"With those blistered palms... squeeze tighter..."
"Like this?"
"Yes... make me your toy..."
"Are you sure? It will hurt."
"I don't mind... It's your palms... these palms... love me with them..."
I lost my composure and took hold of her. And so, the man who returned home filthier every day toyed with his young wife in various ways—she who, inversely, grew more beautiful by the day—driven by an interest laced with cruelty, as if violating something sacred night after night.
Moreover, in the heat of our embrace, breathless with excitement, she would whisper again and again:
"Don't quit this job, okay... This is enough for our life..."
"No, I intend to find a position better suited to an intellectual soon..."
When I said this, she would stroke my fingers gently with her wax-white hands, as if treasuring them.
"It's fine, just like this. Get dirtier, get pitch black... It's fine if you get rough and coarse. And then... you can do whatever you want to me... hit me... torment me... I am happy..."
She would blurt this out, her chest heaving.

**Fingers Creeping into Wife's Soft Skin**

I never dreamed that Mitsuko possessed such stimulating propensities.
Ever since we came to stay in the Boss's house, something obscene seems to have influenced her—suddenly taking root within her modest, elegant nature. I did not yet understand what it was.

**[Character Introduction]**
**Boku (Me)** — Protagonist. A university-educated intellectual living hand-to-mouth as a day laborer due to the depression.
**Mitsuko** — My wife. An innocent young woman of fresh beauty, still retaining the traces of girlhood, ignorant of the ways of the world.
**Oyakata (Boss)** — The master of the house where we rent a room.
**Oyuki-san** — The Boss's wife. Just past thirty, a voluptuous woman in her prime. She likely has strong Masochistic tendencies.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Format:** Serialized fiction or short story (Short Story / *Tanpen*).
*   **Genre:** *Ero-guro Nonsense* / Social Realism / SM Erotica. The text blends the "proletarian literature" aesthetic (poverty, labor, mud) with the perverse psychology typical of *Kitan Club*.
*   **Narrative Voice:** First-person ("Boku"), confessional, analytical yet bewildered by the wife's transformation.
*   **Character Archetypes:**
    *   *The Fallen Intellectual:* A common trope in post-war Japan—men of status reduced to physical labor, feeling emasculated yet finding a strange virility in the degradation.
    *   *The Corrupted Innocent:* The wife (Mitsuko) whose purity is enhanced, not diminished, by the filth of her husband's labor, signaling a fetishistic awakening.
*   **Layout Cues:** The explicit "Character Introduction" box suggests this might be the first installment of a serial, or a recap for a story in progress. The text explicitly references the "Boss's wife" (Oyuki) having M tendencies, foreshadowing that Mitsuko is learning these behaviors from the woman in the next room (whose light she watches through the sliding door).

---

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **"Inteli" (Intellectual) vs. "Dokata" (Navvy/Laborer):** The protagonist identifies as an *interi* (from "intelligentsia") forced into *dokata* work due to *fukyou* (depression/recession). This places the story likely in the early Showa depression (pre-war) or the chaotic post-war recovery period. The class anxiety is palpable; his hands are "ruined," yet his wife eroticizes this class degradation.
*   **The "M" Label:** The character box explicitly uses "M" (as in S&M). By the 1950s (when *Kitan Club* was popular), these terms were becoming codified in Japanese subculture, partly introduced by writers like Oniroku Dan.
*   **Housing Situation:** They are renting a room (*magari*) within the Boss's house. This lack of privacy—hearing/seeing the light from the next room—is a crucial plot device. The thin *fusuma* (sliding doors) act as a membrane through which the "obscene influence" travels.
*   **Hygiene & Labor:** The husband sleeping without washing off mud/sweat is portrayed not just as tiredness, but as a transgressive act that the wife specifically fetishizes.

---

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **土方人夫 (Dokata nimpu):** A pejorative/archaic term for construction laborers or navvies. It carries strong connotations of lower-class, physical, dirty work.
*   **弄ぶ (Moteasobu):** Literally "to toy with" or "play with," but in this context, it implies sexual manipulation and using someone for pleasure without serious regard, though here it is consensual/solicited.
*   **白蠟 (Hakurou):** White wax. A metaphor for pale, lifeless, or smooth skin, emphasizing the wife's fragility compared to the husband's "rock-like" hands.
*   **隠微 (Inbi):** Obscure, abstruse, but often carries a nuance of "wicked" or "hidden immorality" in literature.
*   **神聖なものを冒す (Shinsei na mono o okasu):** "Violating something holy." This religious terminology elevates the sexual act to a ritual of defilement.

---

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Defilement as Affection:** The core dynamic is **Mysophilia** (arousal by filth/soil). Mitsuko begs her husband *not* to wash and *not* to return to white-collar work. She desires the "rough, black, blistered" hands.
*   **Mimetic Desire:** Mitsuko watches the light from the Boss's room. The text implies she is overhearing the Boss and his "M-type" wife (Oyuki), and mimicking/internalizing their sexual dynamic. The "infection" of perversion moves from the older couple to the younger couple.
*   **Class Guilt & Emasculation:** The husband wants to return to being an "intellectual," but the wife reinforces his status as a laborer because it sexually satisfies her. His social degradation is her sexual liberation.

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Genre:** Erotic Fiction, Ero-guro.
*   **Sexual Content:** High (Implicit). Focus on fetishism (hands, dirt, degradation), masochism, voyeurism (implied).
*   **Violence:** Low/Medium (Consensual rough play, "hit me/bully me" requests).
*   **Taboo:** Social degradation fetish.
*   **Keywords:** Masochism, Laborer, Intellectual, Dirty Hands, Voyeurism, Married Couple.
