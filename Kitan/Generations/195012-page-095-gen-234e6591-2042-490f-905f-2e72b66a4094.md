[Series Title]
(Detective) Aozora Haruko's Exploit Stories, Episode 70
First Part: 3 - 1 = 2

[Captions]
From the fire scene, a young girl's naked corpse appeared!
Suicide, murder, or accidental burning death?...
The maiden detective who tackled a bizarre perfect crime involving an alibi.

[Main Text]
The Golden Pavilion of Rokuon-ji, a National Treasure, burned down completely, and subsequently, the Shochiku studio in Shimogamo was reduced to ashes. On the eve of the Gion Festival, a fierce fire went mad on Shijo Street, the great artery of Kyoto.
Due to the continuous large fires, it wasn't that they were panicking, but for whatever reason, saying it was for funds to be used for the expansion of fire-fighting facilities, firemen were selling lottery tickets in front of the station. Even so, the basic justification was logical, and even if these were Atami City's lottery tickets, that great fire would have occurred anyway, and just because it occurred, it wouldn't be the responsibility of the citizens who didn't buy lottery tickets.
However, it was also a fact that they weren't selling very well, and even though the sun had already set, the temporary lottery ticket stall did not close; to the stools for cooling off in the evening seen here and there, the group of bureaucrats came to bow their heads, which they rarely do.
On the Kamo River bank this evening as well, bringing out stools and starting a "Meijin" (Stray-er/Amateur) title-deciding great Shogi battle are the maiden detective Aozora Haruko-san's younger brother Goro-kun and a neighborhood university student, Kimura "Meijin."
On a refreshing summer evening, having washed away the day's sweat in a bath, enjoying the evening cool with a fan in one hand in the slightly drunken breeze crossing the river, are Haruko-san and her younger sister Reiko-san.
"After pushing with that pawn, you should jump the Knight (Keima) to this spot..."
Saying this, the "Spectating 8th-dan" gentleman who exists everywhere, forgetting his job of selling lottery tickets and sitting down firmly, making it unclear whose Shogi it is, is Mr. Midorikawa from the fire station branch.
When that happens, before one knows it, a Chief of Staff appears for the opponent too to direct the battle. That is a young man in his thirties wearing a yukata who happened to be passing by.
"Ah, I lost! The battle is not going well; next time you old guys do it together."
Goro-kun finally threw down his pieces and flapped his tanned fan to chase away the mosquitoes on his legs.
"Goro-san, you are weak, aren't you?"
Wearing a yukata over her bare skin, Haruko-san is the one slightly minding her chest that bulges as if pushing up sharply, while pulling her collar together.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Charred Naked Corpse**
*The Maiden Detective Aozora Haruko’s Exploits, Case 70*

A wave of fire had been sweeping through Kyoto. First, the National Treasure of the Golden Pavilion at Rokuon-ji was razed to the ground, followed shortly by the Shochiku film studios in Shimogamo. Then, on the very eve of the Gion Festival, a ferocious blaze tore through Shijo Street, the city’s main artery. 

In the wake of these relentless disasters, the local fire department began selling lottery tickets outside their station, claiming the proceeds would fund the expansion of firefighting facilities. While their reasoning was sound enough, the citizens felt no guilt for the fires simply because they hadn’t bought a ticket—even if the lottery had been Atami’s, the flames would likely have come all the same. 

Nevertheless, sales were sluggish. Even as twilight deepened, the temporary lottery stall remained open. The bureaucrats, usually so stiff-necked, were now seen bowing their heads to the locals lounging on stools in the evening air, desperate to offload their tickets.

Down by the banks of the Kamo River, a grand Shogi match was underway to determine the neighborhood’s "Master of Blunders." The combatants were Goro, younger brother of the renowned maiden detective Aozora Haruko, and a local college student named Kimura. 

It was a crisp summer evening. Haruko and her sister Reiko, fresh from their baths and smelling of soap, sat nearby with fans in hand, enjoying the gentle breeze that drifted off the water like a cool, intoxicating drink. 

"Push that pawn first, then jump your Knight over here..." 

The advice came from Mr. Midorikawa of the local fire station. A classic "spectator expert," he had completely forgotten his duty of selling lottery tickets to plant himself firmly by the board, interfering so much it was hard to tell who was actually playing. 

Before long, a "chief of staff" emerged for the opposing side too—a man in his thirties wearing a yukata who had stopped to watch. 

"Ah, I’m beaten! The tide has turned against me," Goro finally conceded, tossing his pieces aside. He grabbed a heavy paper fan and began swatting vigorously at the mosquitoes nipping at his legs. "You two old-timers should just play each other."

"Oh Goro, you really are hopeless," Haruko teased. She was dressed simply in a yukata over her bare skin. Noticing how the garment strained slightly against her chest, she pulled her collar together with a modest, self-conscious grace.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** A classic pulp magazine layout from the early 1950s. It features a heavy top banner with sensationalist titles, an eye-catching illustration in the center-left, and vertical text columns.
*   **Typography:** The title uses high-contrast, hand-drawn lettering. The main title "全裸の焦黒死体" (Charred Naked Corpse) is designed to look ominous and jagged. The use of right-to-left reading for the titles is a holdover from pre-war conventions that persisted into the early 50s.
*   **Illustration:** The art by Hida Reiko is typical of the *Otome* (Maiden) style of the era—refined but with a hint of eroticism (noted in the text describing her "bulging chest" and "bare skin under the yukata"). Haruko is depicted with a thoughtful, classic Japanese beauty.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The words "Naked Corpse" and "Murder/Suicide" are the largest, designed to provoke curiosity and shock. The detective’s name and the story title are smaller but prominent.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Fires:** The text mentions two real, famous fires: The arson of the **Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku-ji)** on July 2, 1950, and the **Shochiku Studio fire** in Shimogamo (1951). These events date this story to roughly 1951-1952.
*   **Otome Tantei (Maiden Detective):** This was a popular subgenre in Japanese pulp fiction (known as *Kasha* or *Kasutori* magazines). These stories combined mystery with a female lead who balanced traditional Japanese femininity with modern intellect.
*   **Public Lotteries (Takarajuji):** In the cash-strapped post-war era, local governments and departments often sold lottery tickets to raise funds for infrastructure. The text mocks the bureaucrats' sudden politeness when they need to sell these tickets.
*   **Summer Traditions:** The scene captures several classic Japanese summer motifs: the Gion Festival, cooling off by the Kamo River (*Yukan*), *yukata*, *uchiwa* (fans), and playing Shogi.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **灰燼 (Kaijin):** Literally "ashes and cinders." A literary way to say something was completely destroyed by fire.
*   **宵宮 (Yoimiya):** The evening or eve before a major festival, particularly the Gion Festival in Kyoto.
*   **床几 (Shōgi):** A traditional folding stool used for outdoor seating.
*   **微醺 (Bikun):** A state of being pleasantly tipsy. Here, it is used metaphorically to describe the pleasant, intoxicating quality of the evening breeze.
*   **迷人 (Meijin):** A pun on 名人 (*Meijin*, a Master). By replacing the character for "Name/Fame" with "Stray/Lost," it humorously refers to an amateur or someone who is bad at the game.
*   **観戦八段 (Kansen Hachidan):** Literally "8th-dan of spectating." A sarcastic term for a bystander who acts like a professional expert while watching others play.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Pulp Sensationalism:** The contrast between the grisly title ("Charred Naked Corpse") and the relaxed, domestic opening scene is a common trope in detective fiction to build suspense through juxtaposition.
*   **Gender and the Male Gaze:** While Haruko is a "detective" (an intellectual role), the text and illustration make sure to highlight her physical attributes (the "bulging chest," the "bare skin"). This reflects the target demographic of mid-century male-oriented pulp magazines.
*   **Social Satire:** The text provides a cynical view of local government and bureaucrats, portraying them as people who only "bow their heads" when they want money from the public.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story/Detective Mystery).
*   **Primary Tags:** Mystery, Maiden Detective, Kyoto, 1950s, Pulp Fiction, Urban Tragedy.
*   **Classification:** Entertainment, Literary, Mildly Erotic (Soft Pulp).
