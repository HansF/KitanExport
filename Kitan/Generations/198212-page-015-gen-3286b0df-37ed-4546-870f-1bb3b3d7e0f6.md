**愚蒙いさめ草**

一　千巻（せんわん）萬巻（ばんわん）の書（しょ）を見（み）ても、千句（せんく）萬句（まんく）の理（り）を聞（き）ても、その理（り）を守（まも）らず、身持（みもち）なほらぬ時（とき）は無益（むえき）のよみ事（こと）なり、學文（がくもん）するとは身（み）の行（おこな）ひ志（こころざし）を直（なお）さんが爲（ため）なり、一句（いつく）一言（いちごん）の理（り）を聞（き）ても、よく道理（どうり）を合點（がてん）して守（まも）る時（とき）は、其（そ）の理（り）に叶（かな）ひ、一切（いつさい）の事（こと）に亘（わた）りてよし、

一　何様（いかよう）の奉公人（ほうこうにん）も、つとめの外（ほか）の隙（ひま）はある物（もの）なり、是非（ぜひ）ともと心ざす時（とき）は學文（がくもん）も成（なる）べし、又（また）後世（ごせ）の修法（しゆぎやう）も成（なる）べき也（なり）、是（これ）を以（もつ）て知（し）るべし、主人（しゆじん）もなき人（ひと）の隙（ひま）のなきといふは　志（こころざし）のなきゆゑなるを、

なるを、されば智者（ちしや）は、朝寝（あさね）、ゆふね、ついへなる話（はなし）などにて日（ひ）をくらすをば　楽（たのしみ）とはせざなり、只（ただ）學文（がくもん）して義理（ぎり）をよくあきらめて心（こころ）の内（うち）に歡樂（くわんらく）す、

一　人（ひと）の求（もと）め持（も）つべきものは書籍（しよせき）なり、子孫（しそん）にゆづらんにも之（これ）にましたる寶（たから）あるべからず、書（しよ）あるときはいつとなく開（ひら）きてみる事（こと）あり、開（ひら）きて見（み）れば自然（しぜん）に文字（もんじ）を覺（おぼ）ゆる徳（とく）あり、文字（もんじ）を覺（おぼ）ぬれば義理（ぎり）をしるなり義理（ぎり）をしれば心ざし誠（まこと）の道（みち）に入（い）り、こゝろも靜（しずか）に、身（み）も修（おさま）り、家（いえ）も齊（ととの）ひ、仁義禮智信（じんぎれいちしん）の五常（ごじよう）をよく守（まも）るなり、此（この）五常（ごじよう）は佛法（ぶつほう）の五戒（ごかい）にわたりて功徳（くどく）となり、未來（みらい）も善果（ぜんか）に至（いた）るべし、是（これ）皆（みな）な書（しよ）をもとめしが元（もと）となりて、二世（にせ）の徳（とく）あり、其（そ）本（もと）みだれては末（すえ）をさまるとになし、

**愚蒙いさめ草**

一、千巻万巻の書を見ても、千句万句の理を聞いても、その理を守らず、身持ちが直らぬ時は無益の読み事なり。学問するとは身の行い、志を直さんがためなり。一句一言の理を聞いても、よく道理を合点して守る時は、その理に叶い、一切の事にわたりてよし。

一、いかような奉公人も、勤めの外の隙はあるものなり。是非ともと志す時は学問も成るべし、また後世の修業も成るべきなり。これをもって知るべし。主人もない人の「暇がない」と言うは志がないゆえなるを。

されば智者は、朝寝、夕寝、つい（無駄）なる話などで日を暮らすをば、楽しみとはせざるなり。ただ学問して義理をよく諦めて（明らかにして）心の中に歓楽す。

一、人の求め持つべきものは書籍なり。子孫に譲らんにもこれに勝る宝あるべからず。書ある時はいつとなく開いて見ることあり。開いて見れば自然に文字を覚える徳あり。文字を覚えれば義理を知るなり。義理を知れば志、誠の道に入り、心も静かに、身も修まり、家も整い、仁義礼智信の五常をよく守るなり。この五常は仏法の五戒にわたりて功徳となり、未来も善果に至るべし。これ皆、書を求めたるが元となりて、二世の徳あり。その本乱れては末収まるとになし。

## Literal English Translation

1. Even if you look at a thousand or ten thousand scrolls, or hear a thousand or ten thousand principles, if you do not follow those principles and your conduct does not improve, it is a useless act of reading. To study is for the purpose of correcting one's actions and intentions. Even if you hear but one sentence or word of truth, if you understand the reason well and keep it, you will be in accord with that truth, and all things will go well.

1. Any kind of servant has moments of leisure outside of their duties. If they truly have the will, they can achieve learning, and they can also perform religious practices for the afterlife. Know this: when a person who doesn't even have a master says they have "no time," it is only because they lack the will.

Therefore, the wise do not consider it a pleasure to pass the days with sleeping late, napping in the evening, or idle talk. They simply study, clearly understand their moral obligations, and find joy within their hearts.

1. That which a person should seek to possess is books. Even for leaving to one's descendants, there can be no treasure greater than this. When there are books, one will eventually open and look at them. If one opens and looks, there is the virtue of naturally learning the characters. If one learns the characters, one knows moral obligation. If one knows moral obligation, one's intention enters the path of sincerity; the heart becomes quiet, the self is cultivated, the household is ordered, and one strictly observes the Five Constant Virtues of Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, and Trust. These Five Virtues correspond to the Five Precepts of Buddhism and become merit, leading to good results in the future life. All of this stems from seeking books, resulting in virtue for two lifetimes (present and future). If the root is disordered, the end cannot be settled.

## Literary English Translation

**Admonitions for the Ignorant**

*   **On the Purpose of Learning:** One may pore over ten thousand volumes or listen to ten thousand sermons, yet if these truths are not put into practice and one’s character remains unchanged, such reading is a hollow vanity. The true aim of scholarship is the refinement of one’s conduct and the rectifying of the soul. Should you take but a single phrase to heart and align your life with its reason, you shall find yourself in harmony with the world, and success will follow in all endeavors.

*   **On Diligence and Excuses:** Even the lowliest servant finds moments of respite from their labor. If the spirit is willing, study is possible; so too is the spiritual preparation for the life to come. Let it be known: when those who serve no master claim they have "no time" for self-improvement, it is merely a confession of their own lack of resolve. The wise man finds no joy in sluggish mornings, idle naps, or the chatter of fools. Instead, he finds his delight within, by clarifying his moral duties through study.

*   **On the Value of Books:** There is no treasure more worthy of acquisition or more precious to bequeath to one’s heirs than a collection of books. For where books are kept, they will eventually be opened. In the simple act of reading, one naturally gains literacy; with literacy comes the understanding of duty. This understanding leads the heart toward sincerity, bringing peace to the mind, discipline to the self, and order to the home. By following the Five Constant Virtues—Benevolence, Justice, Rite, Wisdom, and Faith—one aligns oneself with the sacred Precepts of the Buddha. This path secures merit not only for this world but for the next. Education is the root of all virtue; if the root is neglected, the branches of one's life will never find peace.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** This is a **Bunken Shiryō (Documentary Material)** section. Magazines like *Kitan Club* (which often focused on "abnormal" desires or fringe culture) frequently balanced their content with high-brow historical reprints, pseudo-academic essays, or Edo-period moral texts to provide a sense of "cultural pedigree" or intellectual curiosity.
*   **Source Text:** The text is a reprint of an Edo-period *Kyōkun-sho* (moral instruction book). The title *Gumō Isamegusa* (Admonitions for the Ignorant) is characteristic of the "Early Modern" Japanese instructional genre intended for commoners.
*   **Editorial Voice:** The editorial presence is minimal, acting as an archivist/curator. By presenting this text, the magazine implies a connection between the "discipline" of the past and the "sophisticated" reader of the present.
*   **Layout:** Classic vertical orientation with extensive *furigana* (reading aids), indicating that while the text is "classical," it is meant to be accessible to a general mid-century audience who might struggle with obscure kanji.

---

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Neo-Confucian Influence:** The text heavily emphasizes the **Five Constant Virtues (仁義礼智信 - Jin-Gi-Rei-Chi-Shin)**, which were the bedrock of Edo-period social ethics.
*   **The "Hōkōnin" (Servant) Context:** The mention of "servants" (奉公人) having time to study reflects the Edo-period ideal of *Shingaku* (Heart Learning), which taught that even those in the lowest social tiers could achieve spiritual and intellectual enlightenment.
*   **Book Ownership:** In the pre-modern era, books were expensive physical assets. The text treats them as "treasures" (宝) to be passed down, highlighting the shift from an oral/manuscript culture to a woodblock-printed society.
*   **Syncretism:** The text seamlessly blends Confucian social ethics (ordering the home) with Buddhist metaphysics (the Five Precepts and the "Future Life" or *Gose*), typical of the religious syncretism of the Tokugawa era.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **Gumō (愚蒙):** Ignorance, or the state of being "dark"/uneducated.
*   **Isamegusa (いさめ草):** Literally "admonition herbs." "Gusa/Kusa" was a common suffix for collections of essays or instructions (e.g., *Tsurezuregusa*).
*   **Gaten (合點/合点):** To understand, to be convinced. A term often used in theater and martial arts.
*   **Nise (二世):** "Two worlds"—referring to the present life and the next life (reincarnation/afterlife).
*   **Akirameru (あきらめて):** In modern Japanese, this means "to give up." In this period's context, it means **"to make clear"** or "to perceive the truth" (明らめる).

---

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Internal vs. External Pleasure:** A strong polemic against "cheap" pleasures (napping, idle talk) in favor of the "internal joy" (歓楽) of the mind.
*   **Self-Discipline as Freedom:** The text argues that a lack of time is a lack of "will" (志). This reflects a common trope in Japanese instructional literature where personal failure is attributed to character flaws rather than external circumstances.
*   **Literacy as Morality:** The text posits a direct causal chain: Reading -> Literacy -> Moral Knowledge -> Social Order. It frames the physical book as a talisman that "naturally" improves the owner.

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Primary Theme:** Moral Philosophy / Didacticism
*   **Secondary Theme:** Education / Literacy / Historical Reprints
*   **Tone:** Preachy, instructional, traditionalist
*   **Content:** No sexual content or violence; strictly philosophical/ethical.
