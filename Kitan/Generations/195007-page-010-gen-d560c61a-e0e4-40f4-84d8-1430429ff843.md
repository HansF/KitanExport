**[Top Right Panel]**
かけかまえのない、若夫婦のところへ、若い時は二度とおまへん、……しかし…… はたの身にもなつてみてくれなはれ。
疲れたる 鼠賊に チャンス と云へばよい
よる 夜中 二三度くらう 新世帯
泥君曰く「こんな入りよいところはおへんで、新世帯を狙ったら絶対に間違いおまへん」

**[Top Left Panel]**
処女 非処女 戦後派だけに 不安心
嫁入早々懐胎、わろくするととんだ疑いを受けるところ、はつはつは幸して、丁度一杯というところ。ちと早すぎしまへんか、指よう折つて数えてみイ。……
きた月をいれてほら ぐらいなり
「妾は正真正銘の処女でつせ」「何に言うてんね。アブレゲールはわからへんで」

**[Bottom Right Panel]**
はきものを突きかける間もなく、あわてゝ逃げ出した。
アパートで 女遊びなどは いたすまじ
間男の はだきついたは 不首尾なり
主人は旅行中と聞いてたんやが、さっぱりわや、けど裏口があってたすかったんや…………。窓から逃げ出すのは、えゝ恰好やおまへんで、人には見せられへんな。

**[Bottom Left Panel]**
懐胎をきらって、避妊薬を毎月のむ。「一筋づゝ」は僅一筋だけの薬をのみの意、一筋は銭四百文。
避妊薬 七つ道具 のなかへ入れ
いやがって 月に一筋づゝ飲み
[Labels: 避妊女王, ゼリー, 呂胡丸]
この頃、避妊薬は常識だつせ。子供産んだら、あかへんし。……ハンドバッグの中で、コンパクトと避妊薬が仲よく並んでいる。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Top Right]**
To the place of a young couple who have no replacement. Youth does not happen twice... however... please try becoming the position of the bystander.
To the tired petty thief, it is good to call it a "chance."
Night, midnight, hitting two or three times, a new household.
Mr. Thief says, "There is no place as easy to enter as this. If you aim for a new household, there is absolutely no mistake."

**[Top Left]**
Virgin, non-virgin, because it is the "Post-war Faction," there is anxiety.
Conceiving immediately after marriage; if things go poorly, one receives grave suspicion, but luckily, it's just barely on time. Isn't it a bit too early? Try folding your fingers and counting. ...
Including the month [the period] came, look, it's about this much.
"I am a genuine virgin." "What are you saying? You can't tell with the *Après-guerre*."

**[Bottom Right]**
Without even time to thrust on footwear, fled in a panic.
In an apartment, playing with women is something one should not do.
The adulterer's embracing resulted in failure.
"I heard the master was away on a trip, but it was a total mess; however, there was a back door so I was saved... Escaping from a window is not a good look; I can't show that to people."

**[Bottom Left]**
Hating conception, one takes contraceptives every month. "One string at a time" means taking only a single string's worth of medicine. One string is 400 mon.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**[The Burglar’s Luck]**
A young couple’s home is a treasure trove. You’re only young once, sure... but have some sympathy for the neighbors! To a weary thief, such a house is a golden opportunity. In a brand-new household, he can strike two or three times in a single night. As Mr. Burglar puts it: "There’s no place easier to crack. Target a newlywed home and you can't lose."

**[The Post-War Bride]**
Virgin or not? With the "Post-War Generation," you can never be sure. Getting pregnant right after the wedding can lead to some nasty rumors if the timing is off. This one claims she's just barely in the clear, but isn't it a bit early? Better count those months on your fingers again.
"I swear, I was a virgin!" she cries. Her husband scoffs, "Don't give me that. With you *Après-guerre* girls, there's just no way to tell."

**[The Apartment Tryst]**
He didn't even have time to shove on his shoes before bolting. Word of advice: don't go chasing women in apartment buildings. This adulterer’s romantic embrace ended in a total fiasco.
"I heard her husband was traveling," he pants, "but it was a disaster. Thank god for the back door! Scrambling out a window is a pathetic look—definitely not something I’d want anyone to see."

**[The Modern Woman’s Essentials]**
To avoid pregnancy, she takes her pills every month. A "string" refers to a single dose, costing 400 mon. Contraceptives have now joined the ranks of a woman’s "seven essential tools." Even if she hates the taste, she takes her dose once a month.
These days, birth control is just common sense; having a kid now would be a catastrophe. Inside her handbag, her makeup compact and her contraceptives sit side-by-side in perfect harmony.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** A four-panel satirical comic or illustrated essay page, typical of early post-war "Kasutori" magazines.
*   **Layout:** The page is divided into four distinct rectangular frames. Each frame contains a hand-drawn illustration accompanied by calligraphic titles, dialogue bubbles (or text written into the art), and explanatory captions in a smaller font.
*   **Typography:** A mix of bold, expressive hand-drawn calligraphy for the titles and a standard lead-type font for the descriptive text. The use of Kansai-ben (Osaka dialect) in the dialogue adds a flavor of comedic storytelling or "Rakugo" style humor.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustrations occupy the center of each panel, with bold vertical text on the sides to draw the eye to the "punchline" or theme.
*   **Coloring:** Simple two-tone printing (black ink on a pinkish/red-tinted background), which was a cost-saving measure for cheap mass-market magazines of the era.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Late 1940s/Early 1950s):** Japan was undergoing massive social upheaval following WWII. Traditional values regarding chastity and family were being challenged by Western influences and the desperation of the post-war economy.
*   **Après-guerre (アプレゲール):** Often shortened to *Apure*, this French term was used in post-war Japan to describe a new generation that rejected traditional morality. They were seen as nihilistic, hedonistic, and sexually liberated.
*   **Contraception:** Post-war Japan saw a significant push for "family planning" (birth control) to curb the population explosion during a time of food shortages. The mention of contraceptives as "common sense" and sitting next to makeup reflects the "Modern Girl" (Moga) evolution into the post-war era.
*   **Apartments (アパート):** In the 1940s/50s, apartment living was a relatively new, urban phenomenon associated with modern (and sometimes "loose") lifestyles compared to traditional multi-generational wooden houses.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term "Kasutori" comes from a cheap, bad-smelling shochu. Like the drink, these magazines were meant to be consumed quickly and were considered "low-brow."

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **鼠賊 (Sozoku):** Literally "rat-thief." A term for a petty thief or burglar.

*   **間男 (Maotoko):** An old term for a secret lover or an adulterer.
*   **不首尾 (Fushubi):** Failure, fiasco, or things not going according to plan.
*   **七つ道具 (Nanatsu-dōgu):** "Seven tools," a set of essentials. Originally referring to a samurai's kit, here it refers to the essential items a modern woman carries.
*   **一筋 (Hitosuji):** Literally "one string/line." In this context, it refers to a traditional way of packaging or measuring doses of medicine.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eroticism and Morality:** The text plays with the tension between the "purity" of brides and the reality of post-war sexual liberation. There is a cynical undertone that "virgins" are a thing of the past.
*   **Satire of the "Modern":** The panels mock the chaos of modern life—the burglar taking advantage of young couples, the adulterer failing in an apartment, and women treating birth control like cosmetics.
*   **Economic Desperation:** The subtext of the burglar and the fear of having children ("if you have a child, it's no good") reflects the harsh economic realities of post-war Japan where resources were scarce.
*   **Gender Roles:** The "New Woman" is depicted as savvy and practical (using birth control), while the men are often depicted as buffoons (the fleeing adulterer) or cynical observers.
