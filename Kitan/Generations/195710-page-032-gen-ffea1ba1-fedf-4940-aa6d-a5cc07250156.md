苦しみを求めて

「苦しみを求めて」 (2)
――縄への憧憬を持つ女性の手記より――
近藤　一

（一）
　惠以子が第三の男と逢ったのは、鎌倉から帰って大分経過した八月末のことである。
　男は二十七才。自称では画家と言っていたが、自己流に繪筆を持つだけの男。それでも『貴女をモデルに傑作を創り出したい』という絵描きの言葉は、女にとって正に殺し文句であった。男の画室は農家の納屋を改造した薄暗いがらんとした部屋だった。
「キミ、ボクのアトリエに来たら、ボクの言う通りにポーズとらなあかん。ボクがよし云うまでそのままでおるんや。そう云ってから男はにやと笑って、「キミも、ヒドク扱って貰う方がいいんと違うか」と云った。
　惠以子は両手首を頭上に括られて吊下げられた。男は惠以子の腰を抱くようにして抵抗を避けながら、洋装の彼女の上下半身を包んでいる下着を徐々に剥いで行った。スーツからスリップが長く露われて腿までを覆っていたが胡乱な風の触れるのは避けられなかった。男が離れると、惠以子の体は一本のロープにかかって手首や腕の附根が焼けるように痛んだ、その苦痛は、羞恥を意識しながらも頼りに足場を探って空を蹴らずにはいられない程だった。男は惠以子の背後に脚立を持ち出し、それに跨って片手で彼女の衣類の襟をぐいと纏めてつかむと、片手で手首の縄を器用にほどいた。二、三度激しくゆすぶられるとスーツもブラウスもスリップも今まで包んでいた女体を落して男の手に残った。パットを入れたブラジャーだけが残されていたが、それもすぐ男にむしるようにして取られた。
「やせとるなア、キミ、一体何食べとったんや。年頃の女はどないにまずいもの食べたかて豚みたいによう肥えるもんやで。何でもキミいないんや。」
　男は惠以子の背に廻り、いきなりヒップをぴしゃ＼／叩いて嘲笑した。男は細引で惠以子を後手に縛り首縄をかけて締上げた。画室には麻縄、棕梠縄、荒縄は勿論、芝居の大綱までが揃っていて、その上に恐ろしい責の道具、小道具が金具を鈍く光らせ壁際に影を曳いていた。惠以子は初めて気付いた光景への恐怖と縛しめの苦痛に「うー、うー」と身を慄わせて低く呻いた。
“Life is short, art is long.” 男は楽しそうだった。惠以子の前へ自作の責絵を並べた。
「どうや、これ。今日びは身体の美しいモデルが増えたそうやけど、ボクだけはモデル早りや。ええ女やなアと思うと思いきりきついポーズにしてもらうろ、どないに我慢強いモデルかて泣いたり怒ったりや。二度と来いへん。

## Seeking Suffering

"Seeking Suffering" (2)
—From the memoir of a woman with a longing for rope—
Hajime Kondō

(1)
It was at the end of August, a considerable time after returning from Kamakura, that Eiko met the third man.
The man was twenty-seven years old. By his own account, he said he was a painter, but he was a man who merely held a paintbrush in his own self-taught style. Nevertheless, the painter's words—"I want to create a masterpiece with you as my model"—were truly a killer phrase for a woman. The man's studio was a dim, hollowed-out room converted from a farmhouse barn.
"You, if you come to my atelier, you must strike poses exactly as I say. You stay like that until I say 'good'." After saying so, the man gave a smirk and said, "Isn't it better for you, too, to be handled roughly?"
Eiko had both wrists tied above her head and was suspended. The man, as if embracing Eiko's waist to prevent resistance, gradually stripped away the undergarments that wrapped her upper and lower body in her Western clothes. Her slip appeared long from under her suit and covered down to her thighs, but she could not avoid the touch of the suspicious wind. When the man moved away, Eiko's body hung on a single rope, and the roots of her wrists and arms pained as if burning. That agony was such that, while being conscious of her shame, she could not help but kick the air, searching for a reliable foothold. The man brought a stepladder behind Eiko, straddled it, and grabbing the collars of her clothes all together in one hand with a jerk, skillfully untied the rope on her wrists with the other hand. After being shaken violently two or three times, the suit, blouse, and slip dropped the female body they had wrapped until then and remained in the man's hands. Only the padded bra remained, but that too was soon taken by the man as if plucking it away.
"You're thin, aren't you? What on earth have you been eating? Girls of your age, no matter how bad the food they eat, usually get fat like pigs. You've got nothing on you."
The man went behind Eiko's back and suddenly slapped her hips "pisha pisha" and mocked her. The man bound Eiko's hands behind her back with a thin cord and tightened a neck rope. In the studio, there were hemp ropes, palm ropes, rough ropes, and of course, even large stage ropes; furthermore, terrifying torture devices and props cast shadows against the wall, their metal fittings glowing dully. Eiko, feeling terror at the sight she had noticed for the first time and the pain of the tightening, trembled and groaned low, "Uuu, uuu."
"Life is short, art is long." The man seemed happy. He lined up his own *seme-e* (torture paintings) in front of Eiko.
"How about this? They say the number of models with beautiful bodies has increased these days, but for me alone, there's a shortage of models. When I think 'She's a good woman,' I have her take extremely difficult poses. No matter how patient a model is, they cry or get angry. They never come a second time."

## In Pursuit of Pain

**Part 2: From the Memoirs of a Rope-Enthralled Woman**
**By Hajime Kondō**

**I**
It was late August, long after her return from Kamakura, when Eiko encountered the third man. 
He was twenty-seven. He styled himself a painter, though in truth he was little more than an amateur dabbler. Yet, for a woman, a painter’s plea—“I wish to create a masterpiece with you as my muse”—is the ultimate siren song. His "studio" was a cavernous, gloomy space, a repurposed barn on a farmstead.

"Listen," he said, "once you're in my atelier, you do exactly as I say. You don't move a muscle until I give the word." He flashed a thin, knowing smirk. "Besides, wouldn't you prefer it if I treated you a little... roughly?"

Eiko’s wrists were bound together and hoisted above her head. Bracing himself against her waist to stifle any struggle, the man began to methodically peel away the Western layers of her clothing. As her suit fell, her long slip was revealed, shielding her thighs, yet she remained vulnerable to the draft of the suspicious, stagnant air. When he stepped away, her entire weight hung from that single cord; a searing, white-hot pain flared in her wrists and shoulders. Caught between agony and acute shame, she kicked uselessly at the air, her toes searching for a floor that wasn't there.

The man dragged a stepladder behind her. Straddling it, he bunched the collars of her garments into one fist and, with practiced ease, unknotted the rope at her wrists. With a few violent tugs, her suit, blouse, and slip fell away, leaving her naked form exposed as the discarded silk piled in his hands. Only her padded bra remained, and he plucked that away an instant later.

"Skinny little thing, aren't you? What have you been eating?" he mocked. "Girls your age usually fatten up like hogs no matter what they're fed. You’ve got no meat on your bones at all."

He circled behind her, his palms striking her buttocks with sharp, stinging slaps. Then, using a slender cord, he cinched her arms behind her back and looped a noose around her neck. Only then did she truly see the room: a hoard of hemp, palm, and straw ropes—even massive theatrical cables—and a collection of grim torture implements whose metal fittings glinted dully in the shadows. Terror joined the physical sting of the ropes. Eiko shivered, a low, guttural moan escaping her lips. 

"*Ars longa, vita brevis*," the man chirped, seemingly delighted. He began arranging his *seme-e*—paintings of bound women—before her. 

"What do you think? They say beautiful models are easy to find these days, but I can never keep one. Whenever I find a 'good woman,' I force her into the most agonizing poses imaginable. No matter how much grit they have, they always end up in tears or a rage. They never come back for a second session."

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Section Type:** Fiction (Erotic/SM Pulp). Though presented as a "memoir" (手記), this was a standard framing device in mid-century Japanese fetish magazines to provide a veneer of "true confession" or "case study" (ethnography of the perverse).
*   **Author Attribution:** 近藤 一 (Hajime Kondō). A common name in the pulp scene; likely a pen name for a regular contributor or editor.
*   **Narrative Voice:** Shifts between a third-person objective description of Eiko's experience and the direct, colloquial Kansai-inflected speech of "The Man." 
*   **Target Audience:** Readers of *Kitan Club* (奇譚クラブ) or similar "red-backed" books (赤本) interested in *bondage* (shibari) and the *ero-guro* (erotic-grotesque) aesthetic.
*   **Positioning:** This is part 2 of a serial, suggesting a recurring character or a long-form "confession."

---

## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **Postwar Setting:** The mention of "Western clothes" (洋装) and "Kamakura" (a high-class resort area) sets a specific social stage. Eiko is likely a modern, urban woman (moga-descendant), making her "degradation" in a rural barn more titillating for the period reader.
*   **The Painter Archetype:** The "mad artist" or "sadistic painter" is a core trope of Japanese *ero-guro* (inherited from Tanizaki Jun'ichiro and Edogawa Ranpo). The artist's studio is a liminal space where social norms are suspended in favor of "Art."
*   **Kansai Dialect:** The man speaks in a rough Kansai-ben (e.g., *tora-na-akan*, *en-ya*, *koe-hen*). In Showa-era pulp, this dialect was often used to signify a character who was earthy, unrefined, or sexually aggressive—contrasting with the standard Japanese of the "refined" female victim.
*   **Physicality:** The comment about her being "thin" and "pigs fattening up" reflects a postwar obsession with nutrition and body mass after the starvation years of the 1940s.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **殺し文句 (Koroshi-monku):** Literally "killer phrase." A pick-up line or a phrase so persuasive it "slays" the listener's resistance.
*   **胡乱な風 (Uron-na kaze):** "Suspicious/dubious wind." A poetic/literary way to describe the draft on her naked skin, emphasizing her vulnerability.
*   **細引 (Hosobiki):** A thin cord, often used in bondage to cause more localized pain than thick hemp.
*   **責め絵 (Seme-e):** "Torture pictures." A specific genre of ukiyo-e and later pulp illustration depicting bound or suffering women.
*   **芝居の大綱 (Shibai no taikō):** Large ropes used in kabuki theater for stage effects. Their presence suggests the man’s interest is theatrical and extreme.

---

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Consensual Non-Consent:** Eiko "seeks suffering" and has a "longing for rope," yet the narrative focuses on her terror and pain. This tension is central to the genre: the protagonist wants the experience but is overwhelmed by the reality of it.
*   **The Power of the Gaze:** The man justifies his cruelty through "Art." By quoting Seneca (*Life is short, art is long*), he elevates his fetish to a philosophical pursuit, a common justification in *ero-guro* literature.
*   **Class & Urban/Rural Divide:** The "modern" woman (Eiko) is subjected to the "primitive" setting of a barn and the "rough" language of the man, playing on contemporary anxieties about social breakdown.

---

## Content Classification Tags

*   **Sexual Content:** High (Bondage, forced nudity, physical stimulation/slapping).
*   **Violence:** Moderate (Physical restraint, inflicting pain for aesthetic pleasure).
*   **Coercion:** Present (The "contract" of the model/artist relationship used to enforce compliance).
*   **Themes:** Sadomasochism, Objectification, Fetishization of Art.
