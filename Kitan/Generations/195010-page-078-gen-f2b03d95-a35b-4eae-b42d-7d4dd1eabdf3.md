山陰線鳥取駅より支線の若桜駅から徒歩で約十粁――兵庫縣境に程近い、落折部落に、建設省戸倉道改良事務所の落折工事場がある。

戸倉峠を改良して、鳥取、姫路間の交通を簡便に仕様というのかこの工事の目的なのであつた。これが完成されれば鳥取大阪間はバスで五時間半で行ける。使役される人夫約百名、大半は地元の連中であつたが、部落の一角に建つ人夫小屋には、あちこちから流れ集つたガラに悪い熊のような荒らくれ男達が、二十数人寝泊りしていた。

八月下旬のむし暑い或る夜、人夫小屋の一間では、十数人の男達が褌（ふんどし）ひとつに素裸になつて丁半の掛け声に眼を血走らせていた。
「チョッ、どうして今夜はこげに負けどおしかな、糞面白くもねえ」
膝前の札が、相手の手に引いて行かれるのをいまいましげに睨みながら、毛虫の様な眉を寄せてそう呻つたのは人夫頭の荒田である。
この十畳の間にギッシリ詰まった十数人の土方連中、天井の丸太に吊された二つのランプの薄明りに、魔物のようなシルエットを破れた畳に投げかけている。
「チェッ」
大きく舌打ちしていまいましげに周囲を見廻してみたが、荒田は腹わたが煮えくり返る気持である。そこへ調子すいた松島が再び挑戦してきた。
「うむ、よおし」
額に玉のような汗を浮べて荒田は応じる。
だが、ますます不思議、依然として骰子の目は彼の期待を裏切るのであつる。
「どうも変だ」
荒田は骰子を手にとって見るが、幾年間使い馴れて来たカラクリの全く無い骰子なのである。
「うむ、わからねえ」
骰子を睨んで荒田が腕を組んだ時、どこから落ちて来たのか一匹の鬼蜘蛛が、彼の膝を這い上つて来た。
「何んだこ奴、薄気味の悪い野郎だ」
荒田は指先で土間に弾き飛ばしたがその瞬間、ランプの光りがぱたぱたと大きく明滅したような感覚に襲われた。彼はギクリとし、物の怪に包まれた気持が見る見るうちに拡まつてきた。

**The Mystery of the Gambling Den**

From San-in Line Tottori Station, via the branch line Wakasa Station, about 10 kilometers on foot—near the Hyogo prefecture border, in the Ochiori settlement, there is the Ochiori construction site of the Ministry of Construction's Togura Road Improvement Office.

Improving the Togura Pass to make transportation between Tottori and Himeji convenient was the purpose of this construction. If this is completed, the Tottori-Osaka interval can be traveled by bus in five and a half hours. The laborers put to work are about 100 people; the majority were local fellows, but in the laborer hut built in a corner of the settlement, over twenty rough, bear-like men with bad reputations who drifted in from here and there were staying.

One muggy night in late August, in one room of the laborer hut, over ten men, becoming naked except for a single loincloth, had bloodshot eyes at the shouts of "Cho-Han" (even/odd gambling).
"Tch, why am I losing straight through like this tonight, it's not damn fun at all."
While glaring vexedly as the bills in front of his knees were drawn away into the opponent's hand, the one who groaned so, knitting eyebrows like caterpillars, was the laborer foreman, Araida.
In this ten-tatami-mat room, over ten construction workers were packed tightly. In the dim light of two lamps suspended from the ceiling logs, they cast silhouettes like monsters upon the torn tatami.
"Tch."
He clicked his tongue loudly and looked around vexedly, but Araida's guts were boiling. There, Matsushima, who had gained momentum, challenged him again.
"Hm, alright."
With beads of sweat forming on his forehead, Araida responds.
But, increasingly strange, as before, the dice pips betrayed his expectations.
"Something is definitely weird."
Araida takes the dice in his hand to look, but they are dice with absolutely no gimmicks, which he has been used to using for many years.
"Hm, I don't get it."
When Araida folded his arms while glaring at the dice, from somewhere a single demon spider fell and crawled up his knee.
"What is this guy, a creepy fellow."
Araida flicked it away to the dirt floor with his fingertip, but at that moment, he was attacked by a sensation as if the lamp light flickered loudly. He was startled, and the feeling of being enveloped by a "mononoke" (malevolent spirit) spread before his eyes.

**Chilling True Tales**
**The Cook of the Labor Camp**
**By Akimitsu Ito**
**Illustrated by Akira Obayashi**

**The Gambling Den Phantom**

A ten-kilometer trek from Wakasa Station, a branch off the San-in Line out of Tottori, brings you to the Ochiori settlement near the Hyogo border. Here lies the Ochiori construction site, managed by the Ministry of Construction’s Togura Road Improvement Office.

The project’s goal was to overhaul the Togura Pass, streamlining travel between Tottori and Himeji. Once finished, the bus journey from Tottori to Osaka would be slashed to a mere five and a half hours. Of the hundred or so laborers employed there, most were locals, but the camp’s bunkhouse was home to twenty-odd roughnecks—drifters with bear-like builds and foul reputations.

On a sweltering night in late August, a dozen of these men were huddled in a single room of the bunkhouse. Stripped down to their loincloths, their eyes were bloodshot with the fever of *Cho-Han* gambling.
"Damn it! How am I losing every single hand tonight? This is miserable," growled Araida, the foreman. His caterpillar-thick eyebrows twitched with rage as he watched the betting slips in front of him being swept away by his opponent.
The ten-tatami room was packed. Under the flickering glow of two lamps hanging from the ceiling beams, the laborers' shadows stretched across the tattered mats like grotesque monsters.
"Tch."
Araida clicked his tongue and glared around the room, his blood boiling. Seizing the moment, a cocky laborer named Matsushima challenged him once more.
"Fine. Let's go," Araida barked, beads of sweat rolling down his forehead.
Yet the mystery deepened; the dice continued to defy him.
"This isn't right..."
Araida picked up the dice to inspect them. They were his own, the same honest dice he’d used for years—no tricks, no weights.
"I don't understand it."
As Araida sat with his arms crossed, glaring at the dice, a large demon spider dropped from nowhere and began crawling up his knee.
"Disgusting little beast," he muttered, flicking the spider onto the dirt floor. But the instant he did, the lamps seemed to sputter and flare, casting a strange, rhythmic shadow. A sudden chill gripped him—a terrifying sense that something supernatural had just tightened its coil around him.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Layout and Typography
*   **Vertical Orientation:** Standard Japanese vertical text (read top-to-bottom, right-to-left).
*   **Headline:** The main title uses large, stylized, hand-drawn brush lettering to evoke a sense of mystery and horror. Small *furigana* (reading aids) are provided for "Hanba" (飯場) and "Meshitaki" (飯焚き).
*   **Illustration:** The art occupies the top center/right, featuring a dramatic, "E-monogatari" (illustrated story) style. It depicts a woman in a kimono from behind, overlooking a construction site, with a giant, haunting eye and a shadowy figure looming above—visual shorthand for a supernatural mystery.
*   **Column Structure:** The text is divided into three main sections/columns beneath and to the left of the illustration.
*   **Page Number:** The bottom center shows "(78)" in Western numerals.

### Visual Hierarchy
The title "Hanba no Meshitaki-onna" and the supernatural "eye" illustration are the primary focal points, designed to grab the reader's attention in a crowded magazine. The sub-headline "Toba no Kai" (Mystery of the Gambling Den) acts as the specific chapter or segment title.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

### Post-War Reconstruction
The mention of the "Ministry of Construction" (*Kensetsu-sho*, established in 1948) and the project to connect Tottori to Osaka via the Togura Pass places this story firmly in the late 1940s to 1950s. This was an era of massive infrastructure development in Japan as the country rebuilt after WWII.

### "Hanba" Culture
A *Hanba* was a temporary bunkhouse or labor camp for construction workers. These were often isolated, masculine environments known for rough living conditions, gambling, and a distinct social hierarchy. The "Meshitaki-onna" (rice-cooking woman) was a common fixture—often one of the few women in these camps, responsible for feeding the men.

### Kaiki Jitsuwa (Mysterious True Stories)
This genre was immensely popular in Shōwa-era magazines. They were presented as "true" accounts of the supernatural to heighten the thrill, similar to "pulp" horror magazines in the West. They often combined modern settings (like a construction site) with ancient folk fears (like the *Kumo-onna* or spider-woman/demon spider).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **飯場 (Hanba):** A labor camp or bunkhouse. In modern Japanese, this term can sometimes carry a derogatory or "rough" nuance.
*   **人夫 (Ninfu):** An old term for a manual laborer or coolie. Modern Japanese prefers *sagyouin* (作業員).
*   **土方 (Dokata):** A colloquial and now often considered discriminatory term for construction workers/laborers.
*   **丁半 (Cho-Han):** A traditional Japanese gambling game using two dice. Players bet on whether the total is even (*cho*) or odd (*han*).
*   **鬼蜘蛛 (Onigumo):** Literally "Demon Spider" (Araneus ventricosus). In folklore, spiders are often associated with shapeshifting monsters.
*   **物の怪 (Mononoke):** An old term for a vengeful spirit or supernatural entity that possesses people or causes illness/bad luck.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Modernity vs. Folklore:** The story sets up a contrast between the modern, rational world of the Ministry of Construction and the ancient, irrational world of superstitions and "monsters" found in the deep mountains.
*   **Masculinity and Vice:** The setting is hyper-masculine—sweaty, naked men gambling and losing their tempers. The introduction of a supernatural element serves as a "punishment" or a disruption of this crude environment.
*   **The "Uncanny" Female Presence:** The title suggests the cook is the source of the mystery. In many Japanese tales, a lone woman in a male environment is often revealed to be a supernatural entity (a *yokai*).
*   **Atmospheric Dread:** The author uses physical sensations (the muggy August heat, the flickering lamp, the crawling spider) to build psychological tension before the "ghostly" reveal.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Supernatural/Horror), Periodical/Magazine Story.
*   **Genre:** Kaidan (Ghost Story), Pulp Fiction.
*   **Themes:** Folklore, Gambling, Labor/Construction, 1950s Japan, Supernatural, Yokai.
*   **Tone:** Suspenseful, Gritty, Atmospheric.
