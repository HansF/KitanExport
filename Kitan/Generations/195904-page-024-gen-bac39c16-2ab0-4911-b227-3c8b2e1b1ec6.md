文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き

ったろう。彼女は忽ち衆徒に捕えられ、妊娠の身を拷問にかけられ、義経の行方を問われたが、彼女とてその行き先を知っているわけはなかった。彼女は一旦は京都の母磯の禅師の許に身を寄せていたが、義経の子を妊んでいることが六波羅に聞え、召し取られて鎌倉に送られることになった。
　鎌倉には有名な敵役、梶原景時がいた。義経記によると、彼は、「敵の子を妊んだ女は、頭を砕き、骨を拉ぎ、髄を抜かるべき大罪である。あと一月待って、生んだ子を殺そうと思って、なまじっか情をかけ、身替りでもつかまされては大変だ。」と進言をしたので、頼朝は、「静の腹を引き裂いて、にくい九郎の胎児を引きずり出せ」と命令した。幸若舞曲の本文に従うと、次のように書いてある。
　『去る間梶原は思う様に仕せ。内々打笑い、静があたりへ立ち寄って、あらいたわしや、今夜御内より胎児を探ししつけんとの御説の候。覚召さるる事の候はば、何事も母御前に仰おかれ候へと空涙して語る。静御前の母禅師（いそのぜんじ）娘を抱きつつ、抑（そもそも）人の親の習いにて、あしき子数多（あまた）あるだにも別れと言えばものうきに。ましてや申さむ自らが、唯一人の静御前、見目形（みめかたち）心様、上下に並ぶ人なしと、世にも隠れぬ一人子を先立て何と成るべきぞ、如何なる朝敵逆臣も女を殺すことはなし、たとえ厳格（いかめ）しき、夷（えびす）の住家（すみか）なれど盛りの花を風無うて、切り枯らしたことやある。愛（め）でたてまつりける鎌倉の政（まつりごと）と、かきくどき泣くより外の事はなし。』
　静はその夜冥府へ向う輿に乗せられ、涙ながらに由比の浜辺へ連れ出された。
　折柄、文治二年七月十五夜の月が青白く静のうなじを照らしている。みぎわに打ちすえられた台の上に、静はあきらめたように上って行く。着ている水干が荒吏どもの手で一枚ずつ

つはがれて行く。衣の下から、美しい肌につつまれた大きな腹があらわれる。その美しさに、さすがの梶原もため息をつくばかり。静は台の上に横わる。青白い月が静の全身を照らしている。じっとつむった目。まつげに露が宿っている。ぐっと張りつめた乳房の黒くなった先端は、かすかにふるえている。小山のようなおなかの頂に、道化者の臍だけが、苦労も知らぬげに微笑をしている。しかしその臍も、今に血に染まるであろう。
　その時遠くから馬のひづめの音が近づいて来た。鎌倉内見廻りの武士、土肥実平（どいさねひら）の党の者であった。
　ここでまた幸若の本文を引くと、
　『土肥の二郎実平は、鎌倉の警護にて、暮るれば十騎二十騎にて、鎌倉内を廻りしが、何とは知らず浜端（はまばた）に、怪しき人の見えければ、駒打ち寄せて「誰そ」と問ふ。「梶原これにあり」という。「何事でや」と問ひければ、「静が胎内を只今探すなり」と申す。』
　すると実平は、「ここは若宮に近い所、ここで血なまぐさい胎内探りはどうであろう。」と言ったので、梶原も、尤（もっとも）だとうなずいて、他所へ行くことになった。
　静は、もうこれまでと覚悟していたものの、一時でも助かるというのは、どんなにうれしかったであろうか。或は逆にこれ以上の責め苦はないとも言える。
　とどのつまり、頼朝の妻政子の取りなしで命を助けられ、出産の後、男子ならば殺されるということになった。
　もっともこれは、幸若のフィクションらしく、実際は山本富士子顔負けの美人静御前が、月の光の下に美しいお腹を晒すところまでは行かなかったらしい。

　「去る間、梶原は思うようにさせよ。内々打ち笑い、静のあたりへ立ち寄って、『あらいたわしや、今夜、お内より胎児を探し出そうとの仰せである。覚悟なさることがあれば、何事も母御前に言い残されよ』と空涙して語る。静御前の母、磯の禅師は娘を抱きつつ、『そもそも親の常として、不肖な子がたくさんいても別れは辛いものだ。ましてや、唯一人の静御前、容姿も心根も、上下に並ぶ者なしと世に知られた一人娘を、先立たせてどうなろう。いかなる朝敵逆臣も女を殺すことはない。たとえ厳格で荒々しい東夷の住処であっても、盛りの花を風もないのに切り枯らすことがあろうか。めでたくお治めになる鎌倉の政道よ』と、切々と泣くより外はなかった。」
　静はその夜、冥府へ向かう輿（こし）に乗せられ、涙ながらに由比ヶ浜へ連れ出された。
　折しも、文治二年七月十五夜の月が青白く静のうなじを照らしている。渚（なぎさ）に据えられた台の上に、静は諦めたように上がっていく。着ている水干（すいかん）が荒くれ者どもの手で一枚ずつ……

……剥がれていく。衣の下から、美しい肌に包まれた大きな腹が現れる。その美しさに、さすがの梶原もため息をつくばかり。静は台の上に横たわる。青白い月が静の全身を照らしている。じっと閉じた目。まつ毛に露が宿っている。ぐっと張りつめた乳房の黒くなった先端は、かすかに震えている。小山のようなお腹の頂に、道化者のへそだけが、苦労も知らぬげに微笑をしている。しかしそのへそも、今に血に染まるであろう。
　その時、遠くから馬の蹄の音が近づいてきた。鎌倉内見回りの武士、土肥実平の配下の者であった。

　「土肥の二郎実平は、鎌倉の警護にて、暮れれば十騎二十騎にて鎌倉内を回っていたが、何とは知らず浜辺に怪しき人が見えたので、馬を寄せて『誰だ』と問う。『梶原がここにいる』と言う。『何事か』と問えば、『静の胎内をただ今探す（胎児を取り出す）ところだ』と答える。」
　すると実平は、「ここは若宮（鶴岡八幡宮）に近い場所だ。ここで血なまぐさい胎内探しをするのはいかがなものか」と言ったので、梶原も「もっともだ」と頷いて、他所へ行くことになった。
　静は、もうこれまでと覚悟していたものの、一時でも助かるというのは、どんなに嬉しかったであろうか。あるいは逆に、これ以上の責め苦はないとも言える。
　結局のところ、頼朝の妻、北条政子のとりなしで命を助けられ、出産の後に男子ならば殺されるということになった。
　もっともこれは、幸若舞のフィクションらしく、実際は山本富士子も顔負けの美人、静御前が、月の光の下で美しいお腹を晒すところまでは行かなかったらしい。

Literature-in appeared-woman-of belly-tearing

...would have been. She immediately by monks/crowd was captured, pregnant body torture-to was put, Yoshitsune's whereabouts was asked, but she even that destination knowing reason was not. She once Kyoto's mother Iso-no-Zenji's place at body had placed, but Yoshitsune's child carrying-fact Rokuhara-to was heard, taken-and Kamakura-to sent-to be-decided.
In Kamakura, famous villain Kajiwara Kagetoki existed. According to *Gikeiki*, he, "Enemy's child pregnant woman, head smash, bone crush, marrow extract-should be great-crime is. One month wait, born child kill-intended, half-hearted mercy show, substitute even if pushed-on-us would be terrible." thus advised, so Yoritomo, "Shizuka's belly tear-open, hateful Kurō's (Yoshitsune's) fetus drag-out" thus ordered. *Kōwakamai* text according-to, as follows written is:
"Meanwhile Kajiwara as-he-pleased let-do. Inwardly laughing, Shizuka's vicinity-to approached, 'Oh pitiful, tonight from inside fetus search-and-find-should-be-done command is. Prepared-of-fact if-is, anything mother-before say-and-leave-please' thus fake-tears-with spoke. Shizuka Gozen's mother Zenji daughter holding, 'Indeed person's parent habit-as, bad children many exist even-if, parting say-if weary-to-be. Even more say-of myself-of, only one Shizuka Gozen, appearance-shape heart-manner, above-below matching person none-as, world-in-also not-hidden only-child first-send-out what-to become-should? Whatever morning-enemy rebel-vassal also woman kill thing is-none. Even if strict rough-less, barbarians' dwelling-place although, peak-of flower wind-without, cut-withered thing exists? Praise-offered Kamakura's governance' thus, complaining-and-crying than other thing was none."
Shizuka that night afterlife-towards-going palanquin-on was put, tears-while Yuigahama beach-to was taken out.
At that time, Bunji 2nd year July 15th night moon pale-white Shizuka's nape illuminating is. Water's edge-at placed platform-on, Shizuka as-if-gave-up went up. Wearing *suikan* (robe) rough-officials' hands-by one-by-one...

...being peeled away. Clothing under-from, beautiful skin-in wrapped large belly appears. That beauty-at, as expected Kajiwara also sigh breath-only. Shizuka platform-on lies. Pale moon Shizuka's whole body illuminating is. Firmly closed eyes. Eyelashes-on dew dwelling is. Tightly-stretched breasts' blackened tips, faintly trembling are. Small-mountain-like stomach's top-on, clown-of navel only, hardship-also unknown-like-as smiling is. However that navel also, soon blood-in stained will-be.
That time far-from horse hooves sound approached. Kamakura-inside patrol warrior, Doi Sanehira's party-of person was.
Here again *Kōwakamai* text quote-if,
"Doi-no-Jirō Sanehira, Kamakura's guard-at, evening-became-if 10-riders 20-riders-at, Kamakura-inside was-turning, what-not knowing beach-edge-at, suspicious person having-seen, horse-spurred-near 'Who' thus asks. 'Kajiwara here in' says. 'What-business-for' thus asked-if, 'Shizuka's womb-inside just now searching (fetus extraction) am' thus says."
Then Sanehira, "This place Wakamiya-to close place, here blood-smelling womb-search how-would-it-be." said-because, Kajiwara also, "reasonable" thus nodded, other-place-to go-became.
Shizuka, already this-far-as prepared had-been-though, one-moment-even saved-to-be, how-much happy was-it? Or conversely this-more-than torture is-none-also can-say.
In the end, Yoritomo's wife Masako's mediation-by life was-saved, birth after, male-if killed-to-be-decided.
Truly this, *Kōwakamai*'s fiction-seems, reality-is Yamamoto Fujiko-inferior-to-not beauty Shizuka Gozen, moon's light under-in beautiful belly exposing-point-to did-not-go-it-seems.

**Female Disembowelment in Literature**

...she would have been. She was immediately seized by a mob of armed monks and subjected to torture despite her pregnancy, interrogated about Yoshitsune’s whereabouts. But she, of course, had no way of knowing where he had gone. She had briefly sought refuge with her mother, Iso-no-Zenji, in Kyoto, but word that she was carrying Yoshitsune’s child reached the Rokuhara authorities, leading to her arrest and transport to Kamakura.

In Kamakura stood the infamous antagonist, Kajiwara Kagetoki. According to the *Gikeiki* (Chronicle of Yoshitsune), Kagetoki advised, "A woman carrying an enemy’s child has committed a capital crime for which her head should be crushed, her bones shattered, and her marrow extracted. If we wait a month to kill the child after it is born, we risk being moved by half-hearted pity or being deceived by a decoy." Hearing this, Yoritomo ordered, "Rip open Shizuka’s belly and drag out the fetus of that hateful Kurō [Yoshitsune]." According to the text of the *Kōwakamai* (medieval dance-drama), it is written as follows:

*"Meanwhile, Kagetoki was allowed to proceed as he wished. Chuckling to himself, he approached Shizuka and said with mock tears, 'Oh, how tragic. The order has come down from the Shogun to search your womb for the fetus tonight. If you have any last words, pray leave them with your lady mother.' Shizuka’s mother, Zenji, embraced her daughter and cried out, 'It is the nature of any parent to feel the pangs of parting even if they have many unruly children. How much more so for me, whose only daughter is Shizuka Gozen—a girl whose beauty and character are known throughout the world as peerless? If she is taken before me, what is to become of me? No rebel or enemy of the court, however cruel, kills a woman. Even in the dwellings of the harshest barbarians, does anyone ever cut down a flower in full bloom when there is no wind to wither it? Such is the "celebrated" justice of Kamakura!'"*

That night, Shizuka was placed in a palanquin bound for the underworld and taken, weeping, to the shores of Yuigahama. The moon of the fifteenth night of the seventh month of the second year of Bunji (1186) shone pale-white upon her nape. Shizuka ascended a platform set by the water’s edge as if resigned to her fate. Her *suikan* robe was peeled away, layer by layer, by the hands of coarse officials...

...until from beneath the cloth, her large belly, encased in beautiful skin, was revealed. Her beauty was such that even the hardened Kagetoki could only sigh in awe. Shizuka lay upon the platform. The pale moon illuminated her entire body. Her eyes were tightly shut, and dew seemed to cling to her lashes. Her taut breasts, their tips darkened by pregnancy, trembled slightly. At the summit of her mound-like stomach, her navel alone seemed to smile like a jester, oblivious to the coming ordeal. Yet even that navel would soon be stained with blood.

At that moment, the sound of approaching hoofbeats echoed from afar. It was a patrol under the command of the Kamakura warrior Doi Sanehira. To quote the *Kōwakamai* again:

*"Doi-no-Jirō Sanehira was on guard duty in Kamakura, patrolling with ten or twenty riders after dusk. Seeing a suspicious group at the edge of the beach, he spurred his horse forward and asked, 'Who goes there?' 'Kajiwara is here,' came the reply. 'What is your business?' Sanehira asked. 'I am about to search Shizuka’s womb,' Kagetoki answered."*

Sanehira then remarked, "This place is close to the Wakamiya Shrine. Is it appropriate to conduct such a bloody 'womb-search' here?" Kagetoki agreed that he had a point and decided to move elsewhere.

Though Shizuka had been prepared for the end, how joyful she must have been for even a momentary reprieve! Or perhaps one could say there is no greater torture than such suspense. In the end, through the mediation of Yoritomo’s wife, Hojo Masako, Shizuka’s life was spared on the condition that if the child were male, it would be killed after birth.

This dramatic scene, however, appears to be a fiction of the *Kōwakamai*. In reality, Shizuka—a beauty who would put even the actress Yamamoto Fujiko to shame—likely never had to expose her pregnant belly under the moonlight. According to Tomita Tsuneo’s serial "Benkei" in the *Tokyo Shimbun*...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The text is presented in two vertical columns (read right-to-left, top-to-bottom), a standard layout for Japanese books and magazines.
*   **Typography:** Uses a clean Mincho typeface. The page features a header with the article title ("Female Disembowelment in Literature") and a page number (24).
*   **Visual Elements:** A small woodcut-style illustration at the top left depicts Shizuka Gozen in a state of distress, likely being restrained or prepared for the ordeal described in the text.
*   **Quotes:** Long excerpts from the *Kōwakamai* are indented with single brackets (『 』) to distinguish classical text from the author's modern commentary.
*   **Tone:** The writing is a mix of literary criticism, historical analysis, and "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) sensationalism common in mid-century Japanese "pulp" or general-interest magazines. It lingers on the aesthetic description of the pregnant body while discussing a violent historical anecdote.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Shizuka Gozen (静御前):** One of the most famous women in Japanese history/legend. She was a *shirabyōshi* (court dancer) and the mistress of Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Her tragic capture by Minamoto no Yoritomo (Yoshitsune's brother and the first Shogun) is a staple of Japanese drama.
*   **Gikeiki (義経記):** A 14th-century chronicle focusing on the life of Yoshitsune. It is more a work of "military romance" than a strict historical record.
*   **Kōwakamai (幸若舞):** A style of recitative dance-drama popular during the Muromachi period. It often depicts tragic heroes and is known for its dramatic, sometimes graphic, narratives.
*   **The "Womb-Search" (胎内探り):** This refers to the forced extraction of a fetus. In the context of the Genpei War aftermath, Yoritomo sought to eliminate all of Yoshitsune's male heirs to prevent future uprisings.
*   **Post-War Context (1950s):** The mention of **Yamamoto Fujiko** (a legendary actress who became the first Miss Nippon in 1950) and **Tomita Tsuneo** (whose novel *Benkei* was serialized in the *Tokyo Shimbun* around 1950-1955) places this text firmly in the early 1950s. This era saw a resurgence of interest in historical dramas (Jidaigeki) mixed with a new level of frankness regarding sexuality and violence.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **腹裂き (Harasaki):** Literally "belly-ripping." In this context, it refers to a forced Caesarean section performed as an execution or to kill an unborn heir.
*   **九郎 (Kurō):** "The Ninth Son," the nickname for Minamoto no Yoshitsune.
*   **水干 (Suikan):** An informal garment worn by nobles and dancers (*shirabyōshi*) in the Heian/Kamakura periods.
*   **冥府 (Meifu):** The underworld or the realm of the dead.
*   **朝敵逆臣 (Chōteki Gyakushin):** An enemy of the Imperial Court and a traitorous vassal. This highlights the political stakes of the era.
*   **磯の禅師 (Iso-no-Zenji):** Shizuka's mother, herself a dancer, who figures prominently in the tragic scenes in Kamakura.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eroticized Violence:** The text uses highly descriptive, almost voyeuristic language to describe Shizuka’s pregnant body (e.g., "darkened tips of breasts," "clown-like navel"). This reflects the "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" literary trend that persisted into the post-war era, where horror and beauty are intertwined.
*   **Tragedy of Maternity:** The central horror is the violation of the maternal body for political ends. The text explores how literature utilizes this "ultimate cruelty" to heighten the pathos (*aware*) of Shizuka’s story.
*   **Fiction vs. History:** The author distinguishes between the "fiction" of the *Kōwakamai* (where Shizuka is almost disemboweled on a beach) and the "reality" (where she gives birth and the child is taken), noting how fiction amplifies the drama to satisfy the audience's darker curiosities.
