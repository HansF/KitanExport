This is an excerpt from a mid-20th-century Japanese pulp magazine, likely from the late 1940s or 1950s, given the mixture of "how-to" social advice and sensationalist "Ero-Guro" (Erotic Grotesque) fiction.

**④ ニワカ雨** ——————
晴れていた空が、イツテンニ、ワカニカキクモリ、バラバラツと雨が降つて来た際女性は大抵軒下へかけ込む。
だあら、こんな時は、早速、安い傘を買うのである。
繁華な所なら、必ず、かけ込み嬢の二人や三人はいる。
「お困りでしょう、これを上げます」
「いゝえよろしいんですの」
「いやア、僕はいい～んです」
サッと渡して、イサマシク雨に濡れて歩き出す。情は人の為ならず——ですよ。
広いようでも日本はセマイ。その次に逢えばですなー。

**⑤ 電車バスの中から** ——————
外を見ている女性と、仲のよいアベックが二組出来上つて、万事解決というわけである。

（中略）

男は舗道にいて、思わず視線が合う。そんな時、ちらっと笑うか、ちよつと手を振ると、少なからずホトンド應じる。で、少し先で降りて、歩いて来て逢うとする。
面倒でも、又いゝ顔をしてみせる。
その後は腕次第である。

止めて下さい。哀れむべきセムシの物語を書くなんて——。
毎日日の足を眺めて暮したあの懐しい三角形の窓には埃が溜つていることでしょう。六角形の柱時計も主人公がいなくなつて止つているようです。
あと二十四時間の後には、絞首台の高台の上に風に吹かれてグラ〜動いている息のない私の姿を街の人々はハッキリ見ると思います。
そうすれば、私の身体の中に生きている波子の肉体も、此の世の中から姿を消してしまうのです。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**4. Sudden Rain**
The sky that was clear, suddenly became cloudy, and when rain fell "para-para," women mostly rush under eaves. Therefore, at such times, immediately, buy a cheap umbrella. If it is a busy place, surely, there are two or three "rush-in girls."
"You must be troubled, I give this to you."
"No, it is fine."
"No, I am fine."
Quickly hand it over, and bravely start walking getting wet in rain. "Kindness is not for others' sake" (it returns to you), you see. Though it seems wide, Japan is narrow. When you meet the next time, well...

**5. From inside trains and buses**
A woman looking outside, and two pairs of "avecs" (couples) are completed, everything is solved.
(Omitted)
The man is on the sidewalk, and eyes meet unintentionally. At such a time, if you smile a bit or wave a hand a little, not a few, almost all respond. Then, get off a bit ahead, walk back and try to meet. Even if troublesome, show a good face again. After that, it depends on your skill.

**11. Related Laws**
Penal Code Article 174: A person who performs an act of public indecency shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 6 months or a fine of not more than 25,000 yen, or detention or a petty fine.
Minor Offense Law: 28. A person who stands in the way of others, or crowds around them and refuses to leave, or follows others in a way that causes anxiety or nuisance.

**12. Conclusion**
Anyway, to pick up a woman—in other words, to fish—one must value "coincidence." Everything is ruled by two things: "coincidence" and "course of events." "Love" is planned, and "development" is also... Do you understand?
[Caution] To the ladies and young misses of the world, I hope you read and digest the above and be sufficiently cautious. Out of kindness—ahem.

**9. Discovery**
"But however, dark darkness attacked me who was abandoned by God. When a small, rickety hotel was renovated for construction, the secret passage I carelessly left alone was discovered. This became the beginning, and finally, I was caught by a detective whose healthy-looking nose was red like a tomato. As a murderer who ate human flesh, I was tied inside the walls of a prison that heavily oppresses. The judge in black robes sentenced me to climb the gallows, didn't he? A hemp rope will be hung on my neck, and this greasy bull-neck will be strangled in three days. My extremely persistent love will chase Namiko's meat even after death."

**10. Death Row Inmate**
It is the day before the execution. Outside the sturdy iron window, yellow sunflowers were blooming, and white clouds flowed in the blue sky. Even for me in lonely solitude, unusually there was a visitor. Is it not a reporter from *Kitan Club*, the magazine I used to enjoy as a unique magazine back when I was [an old woman/in an old state]? He was cruel enough to call out to the public with an interview titled "The Cynic Who Ate Female Flesh," saying my ways were too different from ordinary people. Please stop. Writing a story of a pitiful hunchback... The nostalgic triangular window where I lived watching the sun's rays every day will probably have dust piling up. The hexagonal wall clock seems to have stopped because the protagonist is gone. After 24 more hours, I think the people in the town will clearly see my breathless figure swaying in the wind atop the gallows. Then, Namiko's body, which is living inside my body, will also disappear from this world.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**Section 4: The Sudden Shower**
When a clear sky suddenly turns dark and a heavy rain begins to fall, most women will duck under the nearest eave for cover. This is your moment: go out and buy a cheap umbrella immediately. In any busy district, you are bound to find two or three "damsels in distress" taking shelter. 
"You look like you're in a fix," you say. "Please, take this." 
"Oh, no, I couldn't possibly," she might reply. 
"Don't worry about me, I'll be fine," you insist. 
Hand it over with a flourish and stride bravely into the rain, letting yourself get soaked. Remember, "kindness is its own reward"—or rather, it will come back to you. Japan may seem large, but it's a small world. Imagine the possibilities when you "happen" to run into her again.

**Section 11: Legal Considerations**
*Penal Code, Article 174 (Public Indecency):* Those who commit public indecency shall be punished by up to six months' imprisonment, a fine of up to 25,000 yen, or detention.
*Minor Offense Law, Item 28:* Applies to anyone who blocks a person's path, looms around them and refuses to move, or stalks another in a manner that causes anxiety or nuisance.

**Section 12: Conclusion**
In short, when it comes to "picking up"—or let us say, "hooking"—a woman, one must place the highest value on "coincidence." Everything is governed by chance and the natural flow of things. "Romance" is a calculated affair, as is its subsequent "development"... Do you follow?
*[A Note to the Ladies]:* I trust the ladies and debutantes of the world will read and digest the above advice, and exercise the utmost caution. Just a bit of motherly advice—*ahem*.

**Section 9: The Discovery**
"But alas, darkness descended upon me, for I was abandoned by God. When a dilapidated little hotel underwent renovations, they discovered the secret passageway I had so carelessly left exposed. This was the beginning of my end. I was finally apprehended by a detective with a nose as red and plump as a tomato. Now, I am bound within the oppressive walls of a prison cell, a murderer who feasted on human flesh. A judge in black robes has sentenced me to the gallows. In just three days, a hempen rope will be cinched around my thick, greasy neck. Yet even in death, my obsessive love shall continue to hunger for Namiko's flesh."

**Section 10: The Condemned**
It is the day before my execution. Outside my iron-barred window, yellow sunflowers bloom under a blue sky filled with drifting white clouds. Even in my desolate solitude, I received a rare visitor. To my surprise, it was a reporter from *Kitan Club*, a magazine I used to read religiously for its eccentricities. He had the cruelty to try and sensationalize my story for the masses, wanting to interview 'The Cynic Who Ate a Woman's Flesh' because my methods were so beyond the pale. Please, I beg of you—do not write the tale of this wretched hunchback. Dust will surely settle on that nostalgic triangular window where I watched the sunlight crawl by each day. The hexagonal clock on the wall seems to have stopped, as if it knows its master is gone. Twenty-four hours from now, the townspeople will look up and see my lifeless body swaying in the wind atop the gallows. Only then will Namiko’s body, which still lives within my own, finally vanish from this world."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into two distinct thematic halves. The top half is a "how-to" guide for men on how to pick up women (nanpa), categorized by scenario (Rain, Public Transit). The bottom half transitions into legal warnings and then a dark piece of fiction.
*   **Typography:** It uses a mix of standard Kanji and Hiragana, but the legal section uses Katakana for grammatical particles—a common practice for official and legal documents in the pre-war and early post-war eras (Sōrōbun style influence).
*   **Illustrations:** A classic "moga/mobo" (modern girl/modern boy) style illustration sits in the center, showing a man in a Western suit making eye contact with a woman. The top border features whimsical, somewhat surreal line art of faces and eyes.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Bold headers (④, ⑤, 十一, etc.) help the reader navigate different "tips" or sections of the story. The page number "83" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Juxtaposition:** There is a jarring transition from lighthearted "pick-up artist" advice to the grim, cannibalistic confessions of a death-row inmate. This contrast was a staple of mid-century "low-brow" magazines.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** Likely the late 1940s to early 1950s (Post-WWII Japan). The mention of 25,000 yen as a fine suggests early post-war inflation levels.
*   **Kitan Club (奇譚クラブ):** This was a real and very famous magazine that ran from 1947 to 1975. It specialized in "bizarre tales," including bondage (shibari), fetishism, and "Ero-Guro" fiction. Mentioning it in the text serves as a "meta" reference to the magazine's own audience.
*   **"Avec" (アベック):** A loanword from French meaning "with." In mid-20th century Japan, it was the standard word for a romantic couple, much like "date" or "boyfriend/girlfriend" today. It fell out of common usage in the 1980s.
*   **"Semushi" (せむし/背虫):** An archaic and now derogatory term for a hunchback or someone with kyphosis. In the literature of this era (inspired by Edogawa Ranpo), physical deformities were often used as a trope for "monstrous" or "tragic" characters.
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** This literary and artistic movement focused on the erotic, the grotesque, and the nonsensical. This page is a textbook example, combining flirtatious dating advice with a horrific story of cannibalism.

---
## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **イサマシク (勇ましく - Isamashiku):** Bravely/Valiantly. Used ironically here to describe a man walking into the rain to look cool for a girl.
*   **情は人の為ならず (Nagake wa hito no tame narazu):** A famous Japanese proverb. It means "Kindness is not for the sake of others [alone]," implying that doing good for others will eventually benefit you. The text uses it cynically as a strategy for seduction.
*   **公然猥褻 (Kōzen Waizetsu):** Public Indecency. Still a part of the Japanese Penal Code today.
*   **狗儒 (Kuju):** A rare or perhaps stylistic variant for "Cynic" or "Dog-philosopher" (Diogenes style). It suggests a person who lives outside social norms, often in a self-degrading way.
*   **猪首 (Ikubi):** Literally "boar neck." It refers to a short, thick, powerful neck.

---
## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Art" of the Pickup:** The first half treats social interaction as a game of strategy ("fishing") and "arm-strength" (skill). It reflects a burgeoning urban dating culture where traditional match-making was being replaced by spontaneous "modern" encounters.
*   **The Macabre and the Mundane:** The magazine places tips on how to use an umbrella to get a date right next to a story about a man being hanged for eating his lover. This suggests an editorial strategy aimed at shocking the reader and providing a "thrill" (kyōfu/sensationalism).
*   **Obsession and Possession:** In the fiction section, the murderer claims his "love" will continue after death and that the victim's flesh "lives within him." This is a literalization of the romantic trope of "becoming one" with a lover, twisted into cannibalism.
*   **Legal Deterrence vs. Voyeurism:** Including the actual legal codes serves a dual purpose: it gives the magazine a thin veneer of "public service" or "educational" value while simultaneously titillating the reader with the forbidden nature of the acts described.
