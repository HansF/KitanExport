**Thus I Find M-Women [Masochistic Women]**

Kusakari Yoshie

**Knowledge [Principles] of the Hunt**

I am sorry to the readers who have not yet tied up a woman, but the act of tying is not that difficult. Even if somewhat clumsy, if one gets used to it, anyone can do something like so-called *kinbaku* [tight binding] play.
What is difficult is, first, the finding of a partner, and how to induce [guide] them into being tied up without being disliked.
First, regarding the technique of the hunt, this differs variously depending on the person, and there are cases where one must change the method depending on the partner.
For example, between seducing a company OL [Office Lady] and calling out to a woman in the street, naturally, the method of the hunt becomes different.
Moreover, unlike simply taking [someone] into a love hotel and having sex being enough, because one is trying to do SM play, the hunt becomes increasingly difficult.
By the way, when SM maniacs become serious [authentic], there are people who can be satisfied with play that excludes sex, but in the case of a hunt, trying to do SM play without sex... [text cuts off]

**How I Discover Masochistic Women**

By Yoshie Kusakari

**The Principles of the Hunt**

My apologies to readers who have never bound a woman before, but the act of tying itself is not particularly difficult. Even if you are somewhat clumsy, once you become accustomed to it, anyone is capable of performing so-called "kinbaku play."
The true difficulty lies first in finding a partner, and then in how to guide her into being bound without causing revulsion.
To begin with the techniques of the hunt: methods vary greatly from person to person, and there are cases where one must alter one's approach depending on the target.
For instance, seducing an Office Lady at your company requires a naturally different hunting method than picking up a woman on the street.
Furthermore, unlike simply dragging someone to a love hotel for sex, you are attempting to initiate SM play, which makes the hunt all the more difficult.
Incidentally, once SM enthusiasts become hardcore, some find satisfaction in play devoid of intercourse. However, in the context of a hunt, attempting sexless SM play is... [text cuts off]

### 5️⃣ Editorial & Structural Analysis

```markdown
## Editorial & Structural Analysis

*   **Genre:** "How-to" Guide / Reportage (実用記事 / Jitsuyō kiji). This falls under the *Kitan Club* tradition of instructional essays that blend fantasy with practical advice.
*   **Author Persona:** The author, Kusakari Yoshie (likely a male writing under a pseudonym or a female dominatrix writing for a male audience, though the perspective implies a male hunter), adopts the tone of a *senpai* or mentor. The tone is clinical, instructional, and strategic.
*   **Target Audience:** Male readers interested in BDSM who are aspiring to move from passive consumption (reading/photos) to active participation ("readers who have not yet tied up a woman").
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Header:** Bold, clear typography stating the utility of the article ("How I find...").
    *   **Image:** A classic Showa-era SM aesthetic photo (rope bondage, mekakushi/blindfold) serves as visual proof of the author's expertise.
    *   **Text Layout:** Vertical text (tategaki) flowing right to left, standard for Japanese literary and magazine layouts.
    *   **Position:** Page 48 indicates this is likely in the feature well of the magazine, not the lead story but a substantial middle article.

### 6️⃣ Cultural & Historical Notes

```markdown
## Cultural & Historical Notes

*   **"Hunt" (ハント / Hanto):** A loanword popular in the mid-to-late Showa period (1960s-80s) referring to picking up women (nanpa). It carries a specifically predatory, game-like connotation compared to modern terms.
*   **OL (Office Lady):** A term coined in the 1960s for female clerical workers. The specific mention of "seducing a company OL" reflects the workplace dynamics of the era where the office was a primary site for romantic (and illicit) encounters.
*   **Love Hotel (ラブホテル):** The casual reference to "Love Hotels" suggests this was published in the 1970s or later. Before the late 60s/early 70s, terms like *tsurekomi-yado* (bring-along inns) were more common.
*   **M-Jo (M女):** "M-Woman." This abbreviation is specific to the S&M subculture, denoting a female masochist. It treats the inclination as a specific identity category or "type" to be discovered.
*   **Censorship (Mekakushi):** The white bar over the eyes is a legal requirement (Article 175 of the Penal Code regarding obscenity) but also a stylistic trope in Japanese erotica, simultaneously protecting identity and dehumanizing the subject into an object of fantasy.

### 7️⃣ Lexical & Semantic Notes

```markdown
## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

*   **緊縛 (Kinbaku):** Literally "tight binding." In this context, it refers to erotic bondage. The text distinguishes this from mere "tying" (shibaru), implying an aesthetic or sexual element.
*   **誘導 (Yūdō):** "Induction," "Guidance," or "Leading." In this context, it serves as a euphemism for manipulation or grooming—convincing a partner to consent to an act they might otherwise reject.
*   **SMマニア (SM Mania):** "SM Maniac/Enthusiast." *Mania* in Japanese does not carry the clinical definition of insanity; it is closer to "hardcore fan" or "otaku."
*   **口説く (Kudoku):** To seduce, to persuade, to make a pass at. A traditional verb for wooing, implying verbal skill.
```

### 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

```markdown
## Themes & Subtext

*   **The Gamification of Intimacy:** The text frames sexual encounters as a "Hunt" with "techniques" and "strategies." Women are "targets" to be acquired, and their reluctance is an obstacle to be navigated via "induction."
*   **Technocracy of Sex:** The author dismisses the physical act of tying as easy/learnable skills, placing higher value on the psychological manipulation required to secure a partner. This reflects a shift from physical technique to psychological dominance.
*   **Hierarchies of Pleasure:** The text subtly establishes a hierarchy where "SM play" is more difficult and sophisticated than "simple sex in a love hotel." It appeals to the reader's desire to be elite or advanced in their sexual practices.
*   **The Barrier of Shame:** The core tension identified is "how to tie without being disliked." The text acknowledges the social taboo of BDSM and presents itself as a guide to navigating/breaking that taboo within a relationship.
