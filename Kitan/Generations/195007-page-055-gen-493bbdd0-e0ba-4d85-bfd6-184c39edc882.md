怪奇小説　淑女の小便を飲む男

一、

　あの異常な事実を、今から思ひ出すだけでも、ぞつと身震いするのであるが、さて筆をとつてみると何から書き出したらいいものか全く迷つてしまうのである。
　そう、あれは確か三月も半ば過ぎて、あちこちの隅に残つた雪がとけ始め、木々の芽がふつくらとふくらみかけた頃だつた。
　私は仕事の関係でしばらく会わなかつた友人の刈田から一通の速達便を受け取つたのである。私と刈田とは、學校以来の犬の仲好しで然かも彼とは同じ市内に住んでいたのであるから、速達を出す程急な用事があれば、出向いて来てくれればいいのにと思ひながら封を切つた途端、私の顔はさつと曇らずにはおれなかつた。
「親愛なる貴田川君
　それには、走り書きでごく簡単に、
　突然君を驚かして申譯ない全く急だつた俺は今、明日をも知れぬ重病の床に喘いでいる。ついては、君にお頼みしたいことがあるのだ。この手紙が着き次第至急来て欲しい」
と、それだけ書いてあつた。
　君にお頼みしたいことがあるつて、金のことかな。だが、あんなに丈夫な奴だつたのに人間つて分らないもんだなと思ひながら、私は、取るものも取り敢えずあわただしく、家を飛び出したのである。
　市電で約十五分、それから歩いて八分ばかり、殆んど郊外に近い焼け残りた住宅地の一角に、私と同様まだ獨身の刈田が二階を借りて下宿している家がある。
　私は、下宿のおばさんに断わつて、勝手知つたうす暗い階段をとんとんと昇り、刈田の部屋の障子に手をかけて開けようとした時だつた。
　部屋の中から、妙にしわがれた陰気な、それにどこか厳かな女の聲が響いて来た。
　誰か来ているな。私は、障子に手をかけたまま、何気なくその聲に耳を傾けて立ちすくんだ。
「いいですかこれがこの間お話しした支那から傳来の高貴薬ですよ。これはその草の根を粉にしたものです。何遍も言うようですが、これをこのまゝ飲んだのでは駄目ですよ、いいですか。必ず二十二才の、まだ男を知らない女からとつた尿に溶かして、それを四十分位煮てから飲むのですよ。分かりましたねそうすればあなたは絶対大丈夫です。だが、はつきり言つておきますけどね、その女が二十二才でなかつたり、処女でなかつたりしたら大変なことになりますよ。そこをよく注意してやるんですよ。では、わらはは、帰りますお大事に」
　中から、さつと障子が開いて、その拍子に私はその女とぱつたり顔を合わせてしまつた。その女は、すれちがいざまに、私の顔をギョロリと睨んで行つた。
　私は、思わずアツと聲をたてる所だつた。それもその筈、その女の顔は丁度猿が人間に權化してこの世の中に現れて来たような異様なほど黒いしわだらけの老婆だつたからだ。それにその眼が又凄い程気味悪く光つていた。
　その老婆は、雨手で大事そうに御幣を抱え、身にまとつた白衣をひきずるようにしづしづと階段を下りて行つた。
　——一体何者だ、あいつは。
　私は、ぽかんと後を見送つていたがその疑問はすぐ私自身で解決することが出来た。
と云うのは、言い忘れていたが刈田は若いのに似合わず大の宗教信仰家なのだ。所が、宗教と云つてもピンからキリまである。
　刈田が信仰——いや盲信と云つた方があてはまるかも知れない——しているのは、その中でも、私に言わせれば所謂邪教——インチキ宗教——アプレゲール宗教と云う奴だから仕末に負えない。
　無神論者である私は、このことで彼に何度忠告し攻撃したか分からない。だが彼にこればかりは私の言う事に耳をかさなかつたのが不思議だつた。それ程信仰しているのならば。と私も敢えてその事に、触れなかつた。それもこの下宿のおばさん一家がその宗教の信仰家なのである。
　だから、さつきの老婆は、祈禱女だと、すぐ判断することが出来たわけだ。

二、

「オイ刈田、君は医者にみてもらつたのかあんな老婆の言う事なんぞ聞いていたら大事の命を落してしまうぜ仕様のない奴だなあ君は。吊り殺されても知らないぜほんとに」
　私は、刈田の枕許に坐ると開先（原文：真先に）、こう言わずにはおれなかつた。
「そう言わないでくれ俺の病気はなあ。それに就いて君に頼みたいことがあるんだ。ほんとによく来てくれたなあ有難う」
　刈田は、熱にうなされたうわずつた聲で、苦しそうに言つて私をぢつと見

「そう言わないでくれ。俺の病気はなあ。それに就いて君に頼みたいことがあるんだ。本当にによく来てくれたなあ。有難う」

Strange Novel: The Man Who Drinks a Lady's Urine

1.

That abnormal fact, even just from remembering now, shudderingly I tremble, but well, when I take up my pen, from what I should start writing, I completely get lost.
Yes, that was certainly March also half past, here and there in corners remaining snow began to melt, trees' buds plumply began to swell time it was.
I, due to work relations for a while had not met friend Karita from, one express mail letter received. I and Karita, since school days dog-like (great) close friends, and moreover he in same city was living because, express to send to that extent urgent business if there is, come over if he did it would be good while thinking, the moment I cut the seal, my face suddenly without becoming cloudy could not stay.
"Dear Kitagawa-kun"
In it, in a scribble very simply,
"Suddenly you surprising I am sorry, completely urgent it was, I now, tomorrow even not knowing serious illness bed in am gasping. Regarding this, to you a thing I want to ask there is. This letter as soon as it arrives urgently I want you to come."
And, only that was written.
To you a thing I want to ask there is means, money matter maybe. But, such a healthy guy he was yet humans are unknown things while thinking, I, taking things also regardless (in a rush), from the house jumped out.
By city tram about 15 minutes, after that walking 8 minutes about, almost suburb close unburnt-remaining residential area corner in, same as me still single Karita second floor renting boarding house there is.
I, to the boarding house auntie (landlady) giving notice, knowing my way around dark stairs "ton ton" climbed, Karita's room's shoji on hand putting when I was about to open it was.
From inside the room, strangely withered gloomy, and somewhere solemn woman's voice echoed.
Someone is coming (is here) I see. I, shoji on hand putting as is, casually to that voice ear leaning stood still.
"Is it good? This is the other day mentioned China from transmitted noble medicine. This is that grass root into powder made thing. Many times as I say, this just like this if you drink it is no good, is it good? Always 22 years old, still man not knowing woman from taken urine in dissolve, that for 40 minutes about boiling after drink it is. Did you understand? If so you are absolutely okay. But, clearly I will say, that woman 22 years old if not, or virgin if not, a terrible thing it will become. That part well carefully you must do. Then, I (wara-wa) will return. Take care."
From inside, suddenly shoji opened, at that moment I with that woman suddenly faces met. That woman, the moment of passing, my face "gyorori" glared and went.
I, unintentionally "Ah" a voice was about to make. That also natural, that woman's face exactly monkey into human transformed and into this world appeared like, abnormally black wrinkle-filled old woman she was because. Moreover those eyes also terribly eerily were shining.
That old woman, with both hands importantly a *gohei* (ritual wand) clutching, wearing white robe dragging "shizu-shizu" (quietly) stairs went down.
—Exactly who is it, that one.
I, blankly after her was seeing-off but that doubt soon by myself solving I could do.
To say, I forgot to say but Karita young despite not suiting big religious believer he is. However, religion even if you say from pin to drill (from best to worst) there is.
Karita faith—no, blind faith to say might fit better—doing is, among them, if you ask me so-called evil cult—fake religion—Apre-guerre religion calling guy because, it's unmanageable.
Atheist being I, about this to him how many times advised and attacked I don't know. But he this only to my saying ear did not lend was strange. To that extent believing if he is, I also daringly that matter did not touch. Also this boarding house auntie family that religion's believers they are.
Therefore, just now's old woman, a prayer-woman (shaman/exorcist) was, immediately judge I could do.

2.

"Hey Karita, you by a doctor were seen? Such an old woman's saying things if you listen important life you will lose. No-use guy you are. You'll be cursed to death and I won't know (won't care), really."
I, at Karita's pillow-side sitting, first of all, thus without saying could not stay.
"Don't say that, my illness you see. Regarding that to you a request I have. Really well you came, thanks."
Karita, in a fever-delirious floating voice, painfully saying at me steadily looked—

**Strange Tales: The Man Who Drinks a Lady’s Urine**

**I**

Even now, simply recalling those bizarre events makes my skin crawl. As I take up my pen, I find myself at a loss as to where even to begin.
It was, if I recall, past the middle of March. The snow remaining in the shadows had begun to melt, and the buds on the trees were just starting to swell with the coming spring. 
I received an express letter from my friend Karita, whom I hadn't seen for some time due to work. Karita and I had been inseparable since our school days; moreover, since he lived in the same city, I wondered why he would bother with an express letter instead of simply coming to see me if he had such urgent business. However, the moment I broke the seal, a shadow fell over my heart.

*"My Dear Kitagawa,"* the letter began, a brief and frantic scrawl. *"Forgive me for alarming you so suddenly. It came upon me without warning. I am now gasping in the throes of a grave illness; I know not if I shall see tomorrow. I have a favor to ask of you. Please, come as soon as this reaches you."*

"A favor? Could it be money?" I wondered. It was hard to believe such a robust man could fall so ill—life is truly unpredictable. Leaving everything behind, I rushed out of the house.
After a fifteen-minute tram ride and an eight-minute walk, I arrived at a boarding house in a residential corner near the outskirts of the city that had escaped the firebombings. There, Karita, a bachelor like myself, rented a room on the second floor.
I gave a quick word to the landlady and climbed the familiar, dimly lit stairs. Just as I reached out to slide open the shoji door to Karita’s room, a voice drifted from within—a woman’s voice, strangely parched and somber, yet carrying a peculiar weight of solemnity.
*He has a visitor,* I thought. With my hand still on the door, I stood frozen, unintentionally eavesdropping.

"Do you understand? This is the precious medicine from China I told you about. It is made from the powdered roots of a certain herb. I shall say it again: you must not drink it as it is. It must be dissolved in the urine of a twenty-two-year-old woman who has never known a man. You must boil it for forty minutes before drinking. Do you understand? Do this, and you will surely be saved. But let me be clear: if the woman is not twenty-two, or if she is not a virgin, the consequences will be dire. You must be extremely careful. Now, I shall take my leave. Be well."

The shoji slid open abruptly, and I found myself face-to-face with the woman. As she brushed past me, she shot me a piercing, wide-eyed glare.
I nearly gasped aloud. Her face was grotesque—as if a monkey had taken human form, wrinkled and unnaturally dark. Her eyes glinted with an unsettling, eerie light. Clutching a ritual *gohei* wand in both hands, she descended the stairs with measured, silent steps, her white robes trailing behind her.

*Who on earth was that?*
I stood there dazed, watching her go, but the answer soon came to me. I had forgotten to mention that Karita, despite his youth, was a man of intense religious fervor. Of course, "religion" is a broad term. Karita’s faith—or rather, his blind obsession—was in what I considered a "fake religion," a cult of the "Apre-guerre" variety, the most troublesome kind.
Being an atheist, I had warned and criticized him countless times, but he never listened. Seeing how deep his conviction ran, I had eventually stopped bringing it up. It didn't help that his landlady's family were also followers. I realized immediately that the old woman must have been one of their shamans.

**II**

"Hey, Karita! Have you even seen a real doctor?" I blurted out as soon as I sat by his pillow. "If you listen to that old hag, you’re going to end up dead. Honestly, you're hopeless. Don't blame me if her 'cure' ends up killing you."
"Don't say that... my illness is serious," Karita replied, his voice thin and trembling with fever. "I have something to ask of you. I'm truly glad you came. Thank you."
His eyes remained fixed on me, filled with a pained intensity...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic Japanese vertical (tategaki) layout, divided into two columns. The story is serialized or divided into numbered chapters (一, 二).
*   **Typography:** The title uses a large, bold, slightly stylized font to attract the reader's eye, typical of "low-brow" sensationalist magazines. The main body text uses a standard Mincho typeface. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "怪奇小説" (Strange Fiction/Gothic Novel) acts as a genre label, followed by the provocative title "淑女の小便を飲む男" (The Man Who Drinks a Lady's Urine). The use of the term "Shukujo" (Lady/Gentlewoman) creates a deliberate contrast with the "base" act of urophagia.
*   **Design Features:** The page number "56" is visible at the bottom right, suggesting this is a single page from a larger periodical. The paper and printing quality (ink bleed, slight transparency) are characteristic of post-WWII *Kasutori* (pulp) magazines.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII / Late 1940s-Early 1950s):** The text mentions "Apre-guerre" (from the French *après-guerre*), a term used in Japan specifically after 1945 to describe a nihilistic, often hedonistic or superstitious youth subculture that emerged after the collapse of traditional wartime values.
*   **"Inchiki Shūkyō" (Fake Religions):** The post-war era saw a massive surge in "New Religions" (Shinshūkyō), some of which were viewed as predatory cults or superstitions by the intellectual elite (represented here by the atheist narrator).
*   **Medical Superstition:** The "medicine" described—herbs mixed with virgin urine—reflects a blend of folk medicine and *Kanpō* (Chinese medicine) superstitions that persisted in the shadows of modernizing Japan.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This story is likely from a *Kasutori* magazine. These were cheap, sensationalist publications named after a low-quality dregs-shochu; they typically lasted for only three issues (the "three-cup" rule) and featured stories of the bizarre, the erotic, and the grotesque (Ero-Guro-Nansensu).

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **怪奇 (Kaiki):** Bizarre, strange, or eerie. A common label for Gothic or horror fiction.
*   **淑女 (Shukujo):** A lady or gentlewoman. It implies high social standing and refinement, making the title more shocking.
*   **アプレゲール (Apure-gēru):** "Après-guerre." In this context, it refers to "new-age" or "degenerate" post-war sensibilities.
*   **御幣 (Gohei):** Wooden wands decorated with two zigzagging paper streamers, used in Shinto rituals. Its presence indicates the old woman is a folk shaman or priestess of a "new religion."
*   **犬の仲好し (Inu no nakayoshi):** Literally "dog's close friends." It is an idiomatic (and slightly archaic) way of saying very close/inseparable friends, though "Inu-saru" (Dog and Monkey) usually means enemies. Here it's used for intimacy.
*   **権化 (Gonge):** Incarnation or embodiment. Usually used for deities, but here used to describe the old woman looking like a "monkey in human form."

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Rationalism vs. Superstition:** The central conflict is between the narrator (an atheist/rationalist) and Karita (a blind believer in cults). This mirrored a real social anxiety in post-war Japan regarding the "spiritual vacuum" left by the Emperor's declaration of humanity.
*   **Ero-Guro-Nansensu:** The story fits into the "Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense" tradition. The idea of drinking a "lady's urine" serves as a provocative hook that combines a medical oddity with a fetishistic undertone.
*   **The Grotesque Body:** The description of the old woman as a "monkey transformed into a human" with "eerie eyes" is a classic trope in Japanese horror/kaidan, emphasizing the "otherness" of those who exist outside modern medical science.
*   **Desperation and Illness:** The story taps into the fear of incurable illness (likely tuberculosis, common at the time) and the lengths to which people would go for a "miracle cure."

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Fiction, Short Story (Kaiki Shōsetsu).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Horror, Grotesque, Superstition, Cults, Post-war Japan, Medical Fetishism, Urban Legend.
*   **Classification:** Adult/Sensationalist (Ero-Guro).
