**今　は　昔**

「その祭事には何がいりま|しょうか」
「いや別に物いりとしては、無|い。幣の料に紙少し、米少し|菓子、油などが入用なだけで|す」
「ただそれだけで濟むものな|ら、一度していただきたいで|せう」
「お易いことです」
坊さんは早速、女を裸にし|て沐浴させて精進を始めた。|そして言つた。
「この祭りは、淫らかな深山|へ行つて只一人行わねばなり|ません」
間もなく祭の道具をとり揃|えると、二人連れ立つて深山|へ入つて、幡を立て並べ、御|洗米菓子など、仰々しく飾り|立て、祭文を誦した。祭事|は終つた。すつかり滿足した|女は、
「まあ妾は、夫の留守のうち|に、何んとよい事をしたの|だろう」
と喜んで帰りかけた。彼女|は若くて、相当に美しかつ|た。それに白色の小肥りで肉|感的な女であつた。坊さんは|彼の後姿を見ているうちに、|心の中に淫慾の生ずるのをど|うすることも出来なかつた。|彼は黙つて女の手を握つた。
「奥さん」女は驚いて彼を見|た。

「私にとつては未だ習つたこ|とのない事ですけれども、あ|なたを見て、佛の恩召し給わ|ぬものを知つたのです、私の|本意を遂げさせて下さい。」
女は恐れおののいて逃げよう|とすると、坊さんは刀を抜|いて言つた。
「もし私の心に従わぬのなら|ば、これであなたを殺すだけ|だ。」
と脅迫した。人気もない山|の奥だつた。女はどうする事|も出来ず、藪の中へ引きずり|込まれてしまつた。

こちらは女の亭主である。|彼は仕事がすんで、犬ども|を連れて家へ戻りつつあつ|た。そして丁度その藪の前|を通つた。と藪の中で、こそ|こそと物音がして、何物かが|動いている氣配がしたので、|さては鹿奴がと、大きな雁矢|をつがえて、動く所へ、さつ|と射かけた。
「あッ」という悲鳴があがつ|た。
それは正しく人間の聲であ|つた。
驚愕して彼が藪の中へかけ|込んで、草をかきわけてみる|と、一人の法師が背中を射ら|れて死んでいるのを発見し|た。
彼は法師を引きづり下した

そして見ると何んたる事ぞ、|そこには自分の妻を發見し|た。夢のような氣がした。ど|うしても眞実とは思えなかつ|た。
幸に、彼女は無事であつた。|そして問われるままに、事の|仔細を詳しく物語つた。
なる程、そこには、仰々し|く幣や御供え物等があつた。|法師の屍は谷底へ投げ込み、|新妻をつれて家へ帰つた。

**〔第二話〕|死屍と契つた侍**

今は昔。一人の貧弱な侍が|あつた。永い間貧乏の仕通し|で仕官するすべもなく、不遇|で過してきた。ところが、彼|の友人が、某國の守になつた|という事を聞き込んだので、|早速出かけてみた。
その方人は快く会つてくれ|た。そして、
「仕官もせずに、そうして毎|日、京でぶらゝして居るよ|りは、俺の任國に行つてみた|らどうだ。大した世話は出来|なくとも、出来るだけのことは|してあげよう、どうだ、一|緒に京を離れてみては」
と親切に誘つてくれたの|で、彼にとつて渡りに舟であ|る。彼は「是非お願いしま|す」と頼んで帰つた。

彼には数年来、通い馴染ん|だ妻があつた。彼女はまだ年|も若く、相当な美貌の所有者|であつたし、心持ちもよく可|愛らしかつたので、自分の貧|乏をも顧みず、通い住んでい|たのであつたが、遠國へ下る|ということになると、その女|を弊履のように棄てゝしまつ|た。
愈々旅に立つと言うことに|なつて旅行するのに都合のよ|い他の女を妻にして、その女|と共に京を早発してしまつ|た。
任地に落ち着いてみると彼|にとつては思いがけない心の|まゝの快適な生活であつた。

そうして安穩な月日を過ごし|ていると、彼の心の奥底に思い|出されて来るのは、京に只一|人黙つて放任してきた、もと|の妻のことであつた。
もとより嫌いで捨てゝ来た|女ではなかつた。思い出せば|切ないまでに、なつかしい女|であつた。思えば思うほど、|戀しさは激しくなつてくるば|かりだつた。
「逢いたい。あの女に逢いた|い」
こうした前の妻に対する狂|おしいばかりの戀慕はいやま|されるばかりであつた。それは|次第に苦痛なばかりに、彼の|心を悶えしめるのだつた。
月日はどしゝと過ぎた。|友人の任期も終りに近づいた。

**今は昔**

「その祭事には何が必要でしょうか」
「いや、特に物入りとしてはありません。幣（ぬさ）の料に紙を少し、米、少しの菓子、油などが必要なだけです」
「ただそれだけで済むものなら、一度していただきたいでしょう」
「お安いことです」
坊さんは早速、女を裸にして沐浴させて精進を始めた。そして言った。
「この祭りは、みだらな深山へ行って、たった一人で行わねばなりません」
間もなく祭の道具を取り揃えると、二人は連れ立って深山へ入って、幡（はた）を立て並べ、御洗米や菓子など、仰々しく飾り立て、祭文を唱えた。祭事は終わった。すっかり満足した女は、
「まあ私は、夫の留守の間に、なんと良いことをしたのだろう」
と喜んで帰りかけた。彼女は若くて、相当に美しかった。それに白肌で少し太めの肉感的な女であった。坊さんは彼女の後ろ姿を見ているうちに、心の中に淫欲が生じるのをどうすることもできなかった。彼は黙って女の手を握った。
「奥さん」女は驚いて彼を見た。

「私にとっては未だ習ったことのない事ですけれども、あなたを見て、仏のおぼし召しに背くものだと知ったのです。私の本意を遂げさせてください」
女は恐れおののいて逃げようとすると、坊さんは刀を抜いて言った。
「もし私の心に従わないのならば、これであなたを殺すだけだ」
と脅迫した。人気もない山の奥だった。女はどうすることもできず、藪の中へ引きずり込まれてしまった。

こちらは女の夫である。彼は仕事が済んで、犬たちを連れて家へ戻る途中であった。そしてちょうどその藪の前を通った。すると藪の中で、こそこそと物音がして、何者かが動いている気配がしたので、「さては鹿めが」と、大きな雁股（かりまた）の矢をつがえて、動く所へ、さっと射かけた。
「あッ」という悲鳴が上がった。
それは正しく人間の声であった。
驚愕して彼が藪の中へ駆け込んで、草をかき分けてみると、一人の法師が背中を射られて死んでいるのを発見した。
彼は法師を引きずり下ろした。

そして見ると何たることか、そこには自分の妻を発見した。夢のような気がした。どうしても真実とは思えなかった。
幸い、彼女は無事であった。そして問われるままに、事の詳細を詳しく語った。
なるほど、そこには、仰々しく幣や御供え物などがあった。法師の屍は谷底へ投げ込み、新妻を連れて家へ帰った。

**〔第二話〕死屍と契った侍**

今は昔。一人の貧しい侍がいた。長い間貧乏続きで仕官するすべもなく、不遇に過ごしてきた。ところが、彼の友人が、ある国の国守（かみ）になったということを聞きつけたので、早速出かけてみた。
その友人は快く会ってくれた。そして、
「仕官もせずに、そうして毎日、京でぶらぶらしているよりは、俺の任国に行ってみたらどうだ。大した世話はできなくとも、できるだけのことはしてあげよう。どうだ、一緒に京を離れてみては」
と親切に誘ってくれたので、彼にとっては渡りに舟である。彼は「是非お願いします」と頼んで帰った。

彼には数年来、通い馴染んだ妻があった。彼女はまだ若く、相当な美貌の持ち主であったし、気立ても良く可愛らしかったので、自分の貧乏をも顧みず、連れ添っていたのであったが、遠国へ下ることになると、その女を古草履のように捨ててしまった。
いよいよ旅に立つことになって、旅行するのに都合の良い他の女を妻にして、その女と共に京を早くに出発してしまった。
任地に落ち着いてみると、彼にとっては思いがけない思い通りの快適な生活であった。

そうして安穏な月日を過ごしていると、彼の心の奥底に思い出されてくるのは、京にただ一人黙って置き去りにしてきた、元の妻のことであった。
もとより嫌いで捨ててきた女ではなかった。思い出せば切ないほどに、懐かしい女であった。思えば思うほど、恋しさは激しくなってくるばかりだった。
「会いたい。あの女に会いたい」
こうした前の妻に対する狂おしいばかりの恋慕は募るばかりであった。それは次第に苦痛なほどに、彼の心を悶えさせるのだった。
月日はどんどん過ぎた。友人の任期も終わりに近づいた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**Long ago in the past.**

"For that ritual, what is needed?"
"No, specifically as for things-needed, there are none. For the fee of the offering, a little paper, a little rice, sweets, oil and such are just required."
"If it is a thing that settles with just that, I would like to have it done once."
"It is an easy thing."
The priest immediately made the woman naked, let her bathe, and began purification. And then said:
"This festival, must go to a lewd deep mountain and be performed by just one person alone."
Soon, having gathered the tools of the ritual, the two together entered the deep mountain, set up banners in a row, and with washed rice, sweets, etc., decorated ostentatiously, and recited the ritual text. The ritual ended. The woman, completely satisfied, thought:
"Oh, I, while my husband was away, what a good thing I have done."
And she joyfully started to return. She was young and considerably beautiful. Moreover, she was a white-skinned, slightly plump, sensual woman. The priest, while watching her back view, could not help the arising of carnal desire in his heart. He silently grasped the woman's hand.
"Madam," the woman looked at him in surprise.

"For me, it is a thing not yet learned, but looking at you, I have known that which the Buddha's will does not allow. Please let my true intent be fulfilled."
The woman, trembling with fear, tried to escape; then the priest drew his sword and said:
"If you do not follow my heart, I will only kill you with this."
Thus he threatened. It was deep in the mountains with no sign of people. The woman could do nothing and was dragged into the thicket.

Here is the woman's husband. He, having finished work, was returning home leading his dogs. And he passed exactly in front of that thicket. Then, inside the thicket, a rustling sound occurred, and since there was a sign of something moving, thinking "So, a deer!" he notched a large forked arrow and quickly shot at the moving place.
"Ah!" a scream rose.
It was truly a human voice.
Startled, he ran into the thicket, and when he pushed aside the grass and looked, he discovered a priest had been shot in the back and was dead.
He pulled the priest down.

And when he looked, what a thing! There he discovered his own wife. It felt like a dream. He could not believe it was reality.
Fortunately, she was safe. And just as asked, she told the details of the matter minutely.
Indeed, there, ostentatiously, were offerings and such. He threw the priest's corpse into the bottom of the valley and returned home taking his new wife.

**[Chapter 2] The Samurai Who Pledged with a Corpse**

Long ago. There was a single poor samurai. For a long time, throughout his poverty, he had no way to serve a lord and lived in misfortune. However, because he heard that his friend had become the governor of a certain province, he went out immediately.
That helper met him kindly. And:
"Rather than hanging around Kyoto every day without serving, how about coming to my appointed province? Even if I cannot give great care, I will do what I can. How about it, try leaving Kyoto together."
Since he kindly invited him, for him, it was a 'boat at the crossing' (a timely help). He said "By all means, please" and went home.

For him, for several years, there was a wife he had become familiar with through visiting. She was still young in years, was the possessor of considerable beauty, and since her heart was good and she was lovely, she had lived with him without even minding his poverty. But when it came to going down to a far province, he threw that woman away like a worn-out shoe.
Finally, when it was decided to set out on the journey, he made another woman convenient for traveling his wife and departed Kyoto early with that woman.
When he settled in the place of appointment, for him, it was an unexpected, comfortable life according to his heart.

Thus, as he spent peaceful months and days, that which came to be remembered in the depths of his heart was the matter of the original wife whom he had silently abandoned alone in Kyoto.
To begin with, she was not a woman he had come to hate and discarded. When he remembered, she was a nostalgic woman to the point of pain. The more he thought, the more the longing became nothing but intense.
"I want to see her. I want to see that woman."
Such nearly mad longing for the previous wife was only increased. That, gradually, into only pain, tormented his heart.
Months and days passed rapidly. The friend's term of office also approached the end.

**Tales of Times Now Past**

"What will be required for this ritual?" the woman asked.
"Nothing in particular," the priest replied. "Just some paper for the offerings, a bit of rice, some sweets, and oil. That is all."
"If that is all it takes, then I should very much like you to perform it for me."
"It is easily done."
The priest immediately had the woman strip and bathe for purification. Then he told her, "This rite must be performed deep in the mountains, in a secluded spot, with no one else present."
Once the ritual implements were ready, the two set off together into the mountains. There, they set up banners and laid out offerings of rice and sweets with great ceremony while the priest chanted the sacred texts. When the ritual was over, the woman felt a deep sense of satisfaction. *To think,* she mused joyfully as she turned to leave, *that I have accomplished such a virtuous deed while my husband was away.*
She was young and strikingly beautiful, with a fair complexion and a soft, sensuous figure. As the priest watched her walk away, he found himself overwhelmed by a sudden, uncontrollable lust. He reached out and silently grabbed her hand.
"Madam," he said. Startled, the woman turned to look at him.

"This is something I have never been taught," the priest continued, "but looking upon you, I realize I cannot resist the path the Buddha forbids. Please, let me have my way."
Terrified, the woman tried to flee, but the priest drew his sword. "If you do not submit to my desire," he threatened, "I will simply kill you here."
They were deep in the desolate mountains, far from any help. Having no other choice, the woman was dragged into the thicket.

Meanwhile, the woman’s husband was returning from work with his dogs. He happened to be passing right in front of that very thicket. Hearing a rustling sound and sensing movement within the brush, he thought, *Aha! A deer!* He notched a large forked arrow and let it fly toward the movement.
A sharp "Ah!" echoed through the trees.
It was unmistakably a human voice.
Horrified, the husband rushed into the thicket. Pushing aside the tall grass, he discovered a priest lying there, dead, with an arrow in his back. He pulled the priest’s body aside.

To his absolute shock, he found his own wife there as well. He felt as though he were in a dream, unable to believe his eyes.
Fortunately, she was unharmed. Trembling, she told him the whole story in detail.
Indeed, there were the banners and the offerings, set out with such false piety. The husband hurled the priest’s corpse into the depths of a valley and returned home, leading his young wife back with him.

**[Part 2] The Samurai Who Pledged to a Corpse**

Long ago, there lived a poor, lowly samurai. For years, he had lived in wretched poverty, unable to find a lord to serve. One day, he heard that an old friend had been appointed governor of a distant province. He went to visit him at once.
His friend received him warmly. "Rather than idling away your days in Kyoto without a position," he suggested, "why not come to my province? I may not be able to offer you much, but I will look after you as best I can. Come, why not leave the capital with me?"
For the samurai, this was a godsend. "I would be honored," he replied, and returned home to prepare.

For several years, the samurai had lived with a wife whom he had visited and grown close to. She was young, exceptionally beautiful, and had a sweet, devoted nature, staying by his side despite their dire poverty. Yet, when the time came to leave for the distant province, he discarded her as one might throw away a pair of worn-out straw sandals.
Seeking a partner more suited for the arduous journey, he took another woman as his wife and departed Kyoto with her at the first opportunity.
Once settled in the new province, he found himself living a life of comfort and ease that exceeded his wildest dreams.

Yet, as the peaceful days turned into months, a memory began to stir in the depths of his soul: the wife he had silently abandoned in Kyoto.
He had not left her because he hated her. Indeed, when he thought of her, he was overcome by a poignant, painful nostalgia. The more he dwelled on her memory, the more intense his longing became.
"I must see her. I must see her again," he would whisper.
This obsessive, almost maddening yearning for his former wife only grew stronger. It began to torment him, filling his heart with agony. The years passed in a blur, and finally, his friend’s term of office drew to a close.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** The text is arranged in a traditional Japanese vertical orientation (*tategaki*), reading from right to left. The page is divided into two distinct horizontal tiers, each containing separate stories.
*   **Typography:** The font is a classic Mincho style, common in mid-20th-century printing. It utilizes a mix of *Kyūjitai* (traditional kanji) and early *Shinjitai* (simplified kanji), suggesting a publication date between the late 1940s and early 1960s.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "今 は 昔" (Tales of Times Now Past) is centered at the top, bordered by decorative wavy lines. Sub-headers like "〔第二話〕" (Chapter 2) are used to delineate sections.
*   **Illustrations:** An ink-wash style illustration is located at the bottom left, depicting a scene related to the second story—likely the samurai departing Kyoto in a carriage.
*   **Formatting Elements:** Repetition marks like "ゝ" and "ゝゝ" are used for efficiency (e.g., "ぶらゝ" for *burabura*). The use of brackets around speech and chapter titles helps organize the narrative flow.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Literary Source:** The title "今は昔" is the iconic opening phrase of the *Konjaku Monogatari Shū* (approx. 1120 AD). These stories are modern retellings of these classic fables, which often focused on themes of karma, human frailty, and the supernatural.
*   **Post-War Publication:** During the 1950s and 60s, there was a resurgence of interest in classical Japanese themes, often adapted into more "sensual" or "fleshly" (*nikkanteki*) prose for popular magazines. This is evident in the detailed physical description of the woman in the first story.
*   **Social Conventions:** The second story touches on the practice of *tsumadoi-kon* (visiting marriage) or long-term concubinage, and the harsh reality of social mobility where a samurai might abandon a loyal wife to pursue political opportunity—a common trope in *setsuwa* (didactic tales) and later *kaidan* (ghost stories).
*   **The "Forked Arrow" (雁股 - Karimata):** Mentioned in the first story, this is a traditional arrow used in hunting and warfare, designed with a wide, forked head to cut through tendons or bring down large game like deer.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **幣 (Nusa/Mitegura):** Offerings made of paper or cloth used in Shinto rituals.
*   **法師 (Hōshi):** A Buddhist priest or monk. In these stories, priests are often depicted as either holy or ironically corrupt/lustful.
*   **妾 (Warawa):** An archaic first-person pronoun used by women, denoting a humble or subordinate status.
*   **任国 (Ninkoku):** The province where an official has been appointed to serve.
*   **渡りに舟 (Watari ni fune):** "A boat at the crossing." An idiom meaning a timely opportunity or exactly what one needed at the moment.
*   **弊履 (Heiri):** Literally "worn-out sandals." A metaphor for something (or someone) discarded without hesitation after it has lost its utility.
*   **安穏 (Ann'on):** Peace and quiet; tranquility.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Human Frailty and Lust:** The first story highlights the irony of a religious figure succumbing to basic instincts. The priest uses "holy" pretenses to satisfy carnal desires, resulting in his accidental death by the hand of the woman's husband.
*   **Karma and Betrayal:** The second story (a version of the "Kurokami" or "Black Hair" ghost story) deals with the guilt of betrayal. The samurai trades love for ambition, only to be haunted by regret.
*   **Sensuality vs. Morality:** The text leans into the physical descriptions of the female characters ("fleshly," "white-skinned"), which serves to heighten the contrast between the moralizing framework of the "classic tale" and the entertainment value of the popular publication.
*   **The Irony of Fate:** Both stories rely on dramatic irony—the priest dies while trying to sin; the husband kills the priest thinking he is a deer; the samurai finds success but loses his soul to regret.
