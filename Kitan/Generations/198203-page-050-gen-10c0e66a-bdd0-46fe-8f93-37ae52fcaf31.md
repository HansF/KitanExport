## Literal English Translation

To speak of a compliant woman (従順な女) in different terms: she is completely lacking in agency (主体性), meaning, she holds no personal assertiveness, and is entirely entrusted to the man. Such a woman can be cultivated (飼育) into a genuine masochist, and it is much easier and more comfortable than cultivating other women. When you are hunting, I want you not to forget this matter.

**Induction into SM Play**

Now, once you find a woman you think suitable, the next step is induction into SM Play, but there is a matter that absolutely must be done beforehand.
That is, first, having sex that does not involve SM Play. It is not the speech of a yakuza-like man, but in order to make the woman listen to what you say, you must first subjugate (やっつける) her. Other than this, the only way to make a woman obedient is the power of money.
Even if you vehemently argue the appeal of SM Play to a woman, you should first assume it is useless. There are no women who will be convinced by such a thing.
However, after having ordinary sex several times, if you invite her to SM Play, there are cases where she surprisingly easily accepts (乗ってくる). This generally works especially well with women of strong curiosity.
A woman, especially a compliant woman, is weak (ヨワイ) towards a man who has come to know her body. While this is even more the case if she is a virgin, even if many others
have known her, the women who will remember you are very limited.
If you ask which woman is the most suitable, it is the woman who is compliant to men.

## Literary English Translation

To describe a truly compliant woman, she is, in other words, a person entirely devoid of agency—one who lacks her own assertiveness and is wholly submitted to the man. Such a woman can be groomed (cultivated) into a genuine masochist, and this is far easier and more rewarding than training others. Keep this in mind when you are out hunting.

**Inducing Them into SM Play**

Now, once you have identified a promising candidate, the next step is her induction into SM play. Before this, however, there is one crucial thing that must absolutely be done.
That is, first, establishing sexual relations that do not involve SM. Though this may sound like the rough talk of a street gangster, in order to make a woman heed your demands, you must first conquer her. Aside from this, the only other means of making a woman obedient is the power of wealth.
You should operate under the assumption that lecturing a woman on the delights of SM is futile. No woman is convinced merely by such talk.
Nevertheless, after engaging in standard intercourse several times, if you then suggest SM play, you will find that she surprisingly often consents easily. This tactic is especially effective with women who possess a strong sense of curiosity.
A woman, particularly one who is already compliant, is inherently vulnerable (weak) to the man who has possessed her body. While this is doubly true for a virgin, even if she has known many others, the women who will truly submit to you are extremely rare.
If one asks who the most appropriate woman is, it is the woman already obedient to men.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Instructional/Persuasive Essay or Advice Column ("How to Convert Women to SM"). It blends clinical observation with highly biased, directive instructions, typical of *Kitan Club*'s pseudo-scholarly erotic reportage. |
| **Author Attribution** | Anonymous or written under an editorial alias (e.g., "SM Expert"). The tone is authoritative and generalized, suggesting it represents the magazine's instructional voice. |
| **Editorial/Narrator Voice** | Didactic, confident, masculine, and highly cynical. The narrator directly addresses the male reader ("you") as a "hunter" and instructor, positioning the woman as an object to be strategically manipulated and "cultivated." |
| **Target Audience Signals** | Uses terms like 「ハント」 (hunt) and 「飼育」 (cultivation), signaling a male readership interested in dominance, control, and BDSM as a method of achieving absolute submission from partners. |
| **Key Rhetorical Strategy** | The text advocates for **strategic consent**—using conventional sex as a tool to dismantle psychological resistance (sexual history/vulnerability) before introducing taboo activities (SM). |
| **Image Function** | The accompanying photograph of a woman in tight shibari bondage serves as an explicit visual goal, reinforcing the text's instructional aim. |
| **Page Number** | 50. Indicates it is a substantive piece, not a short filler item. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Term / Concept | Annotation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **従順な女 (Jūjun na Onna)** | The ideal female type in this genre: submissive, agreeable, and without personal will. This reflects conservative gender expectations prevalent in Showa-era Japan, heavily amplified by the dominance fantasies of ero-guro literature. |
| **主体性 (Shutai-sei)** | Agency/self-determination. The text explicitly defines the ideal partner by her *lack* of this quality, a direct repudiation of modern or Western liberal ideas regarding female autonomy emerging in the postwar period. |
| **マゾに飼育する (Mazo ni Shiiku Suru)** | "To cultivate [her] into a masochist." *Shiiku* (飼育) means raising livestock or pets. This term is foundational to the genre's objectification and power dynamic, treating the female partner not as an equal but as property or an animal to be trained. |
| **ハント (Hanto, Hunt)** | English loanword for "hunt," used here to describe the search for a submissive sexual partner. It emphasizes the predatory nature and the strategic approach advised. |
| **ヤクザな男の言草 (Yakuza na Otoko no Kotosaba)** | "The rough speech/behavior of a gangster." The author uses this reference to imply that his recommended method (manipulative seduction via non-SM sex) is sophisticated and psychological, contrasting it with crude, overt coercion associated with low-class criminals. |
| **カネの力 (Kane no Chikara)** | The power of money. Acknowledges the economic reality that financial coercion (buying sex, keeping mistresses) is an equally effective path to female obedience, common knowledge in postwar Japanese society. |
| **肉体を知られた男 (Nikutai o Shirareta Otoko)** | "A man who has come to know her body." This emphasizes the profound vulnerability (ヨワイ) created by shared intimacy, suggesting that physical knowledge grants psychological dominance, especially over women whose identities were often heavily tied to sexual purity/exclusivity. |
| **処女 (Shojo, Virgin)** | The text notes that virgins are even more susceptible, playing into the powerful cultural trope of the 'deflowered woman' whose social and psychological status is irreversibly altered, making her ripe for total submission. |

## Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)

| Term | Original Meaning | Contextual Nuance / Euphemism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **従順 (じゅうじゅん)** | Obedient, passive. | Idealized quality for a sexual partner in a dominance hierarchy. |
| **主体性 (しゅたいせい)** | Agency, autonomy. | A negative trait the target partner must not possess. |
| **飼育 (しいく)** | To raise/breed (animals). | Euphemism for training, psychological control, and objectification. |
| **マゾ (Mazo)** | Masochist. | Used here as an inherent female tendency waiting to be "unlocked" through male action. |
| **ヤツてしまふ (やってしまう)** | To do it, finish it off (Old Kana). | Euphemism for *subjugate* or *conquer* sexually/psychologically. Implies a decisive, dominating act. |
| **言草 (ことば)** | Speech, way of speaking. | Used in contrast to the author's own "refined" manipulative advice. |
| **のつてくる (乗ってくる)** | To get on (a vehicle), to agree. | To consent or participate, often implying compliance rather than true enthusiasm. |
| **ヨワイ (よわい)** | Weak (written with old kana ゐ). | Vulnerable, emotionally or psychologically susceptible. |

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis

| Theme | Subtextual Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Strategic Subjugation** | The primary theme is that dominance must be achieved in phases. The author rejects immediate, coarse SM demands, favoring a calculated erosion of the woman's boundaries using "ordinary sex" as a preparatory, dominance-establishing tool. |
| **The Myth of the Natural Mazo** | The text posits that the "compliant woman" is inherently predisposed to masochism (a "genuine Mazo") that merely requires the correct environment (cultivation) to manifest. This rationalizes the act of coercion by suggesting the man is fulfilling her hidden nature. |
| **Erotics of Vulnerability** | The central psychological lever is exploiting sexual experience: once the man "knows her body," she is rendered vulnerable. This links sexual experience directly to powerlessness, especially for compliant types or virgins. |
| **Seduction as Power Play** | "Hunting" frames the pursuit of a partner not as courtship but as a strategic operation designed to secure an object of control. The text is a manual for achieving psychological mastery before physical mastery (SM). |
| **Aversion to Effort** | The text emphasizes that compliant women are "much easier" (ずつと楽だ). The underlying male anxiety/fantasy is achieving total, sophisticated dominance with the least amount of resistance or emotional labor. |

## Content Classification Tags

| Tag | Intensity / Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sexual Content** | Explicit (Discussion of conventional sex, SM, and bondage induction). |
| **Violence** | Low (Physical violence discouraged; psychological subjugation is high). |
| **Coercion** | High (Instructional advice on strategic manipulation to obtain compliance/consent for BDSM). |
| **Medical / Bodily Themes** | Medium (Pathologizing masochism, focus on physical "knowledge" as dominance). |
| **Taboo or Illegal Implications**| Medium (Advocates for using manipulation to bypass informed consent). |
