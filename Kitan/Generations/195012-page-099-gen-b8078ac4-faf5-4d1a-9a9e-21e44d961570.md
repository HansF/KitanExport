からのアルコール検出も出来ず、歩行を障碍する傷痍疾病も発見されなかつた。これらは、泥酔とか負傷とか、疾病、繋縛などによつて、彼女が出火の時、逃出し得ない条件は、何もなかつたといふ事を明らかにした。
かくして、跡迹（あとい）湮滅と、焚殺（ふんさつ）を謀つたといふ晴子の他殺放火説は、完全に覆つてしまつたのである。安治川新子は、何らかによる失火で、過つて焼死してしまつたといふ、全く平凡な火災事故に終つてしまつた。
美代子は帰され、捜査は打切られた。しかし晴子は、全てのデータは納得出来ても、尚心の一隅で、何か分らないが、納得出来ないものがあつた。
「姉さん、嫌に頑強に不足さうな顔してるわね」
弟の五郎君が声をかけても、まだ名残惜しさうに、割切れない表情のまゝ、頻りと何か考えていたが、何思つたのか、今度は鑑識課へ入つていつた。
「ねえ、昨日の焼死事件の、被害者の夜具もう一度調べてくれはらへん？」
顔馴染の鑑識課主任は彼女に泣き落されて、すぐ検鏡に掛つてくれた。その間に若い巡査が入つて来て、本郷部長がお呼びだからと、彼女を探しに来た。その室に待つていたのは、さつき釈放された鶴橋青年である。
「部長さん、何か御用事？」
「まあそこへ掛け給え、実は今この人が戻つて来て、重要な事を言い落したというので、聞いてみると、櫻宮美代子は自殺するかも知れんというんだ。昨日新子を訪ねた時、彼女が頭痛だつたので、丁度持合せていた藥を彼女に与えたんださうだ。それはフェノバルビタール含有の劇毒物で、約三四十分後に胃液に分解し、胃壁や腸管から吸収された時、毒性を発揮するんだし、しかも血液毒だから、死斑などは、一酸化炭素中毒死や青酸加里死などのように、鮮紅色として現れるから、火災現場から焼死体となつて発見されても、鑑識は誤られ易いものだ、と、この人は自分の薬物学上の学識から、そう言うんだがね」。
実は美代子は、最近異性問題で、新子と激しく対立していたので、その邪恋の清算の為に、彼女を殺して、自分も死ぬ積りだつたと、鶴橋君に告白したんださうだよ」
「だつておかしいわ、解剖の結果、胃袋からは何も検出されなかつたのよ。溶性フェノバルビタールは、そんな緩慢作用の毒物と違うわ。それに第一、そんな重大な事を言い忘れるなんて、おかしいやないの」
晴子の鋭鋒に、彼もたじろいたが、丁度そこへ鑑識課員が入つて来た。
「晴子さん、やつぱり貴女は偉い、あれは他殺死と断定しますよ」
眼をむいたのは部長である。
「何ぢや他殺死体やと？」
「あの夜具と死体の表皮から、石油が検出されました。これは被害者を丸裸にして石油をかけて火を放ち、焚殺したものと認めます。
剖検結果の、かなり深部までの多量に吸引されていた煤や、隣室の住人泰一雄氏から、強い異臭を感じたと証言しているのは、この事実を裏書しているものと思います」
又も殺害事件へ逆戻りした事件に、部長もかなり御気嫌を損じたらしい。
「あの室に石油があつたのかね」
と、鶴橋君へ尋問の言葉も荒い。
「石油？そう云えば流し元に、油の罐があつたようでしたが……」
そこへ一人の巡査が
「部長、只今こんな情報が得られました。玉造初枝が脳毒から発狂したが。曙院の屋上から、飛降り自殺を遂げたそうです」
「ん？何時だ？」
「昨日の正午過ぎです。それから、火災現場から約一千歩離れた北方の、寺田一雄氏から、自家用ダットサンに使うガソリン罐が一ケ、運轉台にあつたのが、紛失していると届出ています。昨日の火事騒ぎで、つい気が付かなかつたが、今朝発見したと云つてますがし」
「うん、大分道具建が揃つて来たな、美代子が七時半にアパートを出る、鶴橋と別れる、寺田家のダットサンからガソリンを奪い、そこから一樂荘の裏階段までは、家庭菜園の空地。裏梯子を上つて、劇薬で苦悶している新子を裸にして、その頭からガソリンをぶつかけ火をつける——段々話が分つて来たぞ。櫻宮美代子を尾行していった海老江刑事に、すぐ連絡だ。彼女を直ちに緊急逮捕！」
今度は俄然部長の方が張り出したか、丁度その時かつて来た電話に、部長の顔は、七面鳥のように三轉していた。
「何。海老江君。あゝ、あゝ——何ぢやア？美代子が青酸加里らしきもので自殺したつて？ア、うん、すぐ行く！」
一人の巡査が、部長の気圧の谷の通過を恐れて、すぐガレージへ電話していた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

From [her] alcohol detection also could not do, and walking-obstructing injuries or illnesses also were not found. These, [such as] extreme drunkenness or injury, illness, binding etc., by [them], she at the time of fire starting, escape-cannot conditions, nothing existed [the fact] was made clear.

Thus, evidence destruction and burning-to-death plotting Haruko's homicide-arson theory, completely was overturned. Ajigawa Shinko, by some accidental fire, mistakenly burned to death, a completely ordinary fire accident it ended as.

Miyoko was sent home, investigation was closed. But Haruko, all data [she] could accept, yet in a corner of [her] heart, something [she] doesn't know but, not-accepting thing existed.
"Sister, disagreeably stubbornly unsatisfied face [you] are making."
Brother Goro-kun [his] voice called out, but still as if regretting the end, unresolved expression remaining, intensely something thinking was, but what [she] thought [unknown], this time to the Forensics Department entered.
"Hey, yesterday's burning-death case's, victim's bedding one more time check for me, won't you?"

Acquainted Forensics Chief by her was moved to tears [persuaded], immediately to microscope examination went. In that time a young policeman entered, Hongo Chief is calling so, her to search came. In that room waiting was, earlier released Tsuruhashi youth.
"Chief, any business?"
"Well there sit down, actually now this person came back, important thing forgot to say [he] said, so asking, Sakuramiya Miyoko suicide might do [he] says. Yesterday Shinko [he] visited when, she headache was because, exactly held medicine to her gave [it] seems. That Phenobarbital containing deadly poison is, about 30-40 minutes later in stomach acid decomposes, stomach wall or intestines from absorbed when, toxicity exerts, and blood poison because, post-mortem lividity etc., carbon monoxide poisoning death or potassium cyanide death like, bright red as appear because, fire scene from burned body becoming found even if, forensics easily mistaken thing is, [so] this person his own pharmacology knowledge from, says so."

"Actually Miyoko, recently opposite-sex problems by, Shinko with fiercely was in conflict, that wicked love's settlement for, her killing, self also die intended was, to Tsuruhashi-kun confessed [it] seems."
"But strange is, autopsy result, stomach from nothing was detected. Soluble Phenobarbital, such slow-acting poison is different. And first, such important thing forgetting, strange is it not?"

Haruko's sharp-point [questioning] at, he also faltered, but exactly there Forensics staff entered.
"Haruko-san, after all you are great, that homicide death [we] conclude."
Eyes widened was the Chief.
"What, homicide body you say?"
"That bedding and body's skin from, kerosene was detected. This the victim naked making kerosene pouring fire setting, burning-to-death thing [we] recognize. Autopsy results' quite deep parts until large amount inhaled was soot, and next room resident Tai Ichio-shi from, strong strange odor felt [he] testified, this fact backs up [we] think."

Again to murder case returned-case at, Chief also quite mood spoiled seems.
"In that room kerosene existed was it?"
Tsuruhashi-kun toward interrogation words also rough.
"Kerosene? Speaking of that at the sink, oil can existed seemed but..."
There one policeman
"Chief, just now this information was obtained. Tamatsukuri Hatsue from brain-poison went mad, but Akebono-in rooftop from, jumping-suicide accomplished [it] seems."
"Hm? What time?"
"Yesterday past noon. And, fire scene from about 1000 steps distant north's, Terada Ichio-shi from, private Datsun used gasoline can one, at driver's seat was, missing is [he] reported. Yesterday's fire commotion by, finally didn't notice, this morning found [he] says."

"Yes, quite the stage-props are gathered. Miyoko at 7:30 apartment leaves, Tsuruhashi with parts, Terada house's Datsun from gasoline steals, from there Ichiraku-so's back stairs until, home garden vacant lot. Back ladder climbing, powerful drug by suffering Shinko naked making, from the head gasoline splashing fire setting—gradually the story becomes understood. Sakuramiya Miyoko tailing-went Ebie Detective to, immediately contact. Her immediately emergency arrest!"
This time suddenly Chief side became enthusiastic, exactly that time came-phone at, Chief's face, like a turkey three-times changed.
"What. Ebie-kun. Ah, ah—What? Miyoko potassium cyanide-like thing by suicided? Ah, yes, immediately go!"
One policeman, Chief's low-pressure valley [bad mood] passing fearing, immediately to garage phoned.

Chapter 3 1-1=0

"She headquarters exited when, Tsuruhashi youth and Prefectural Office front's coffee shop entered, for a while resting was, but soon two people parted, Tsuruhashi..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Alcohol was not detected in her system, nor were there any injuries or illnesses that would have hindered her movement. These findings confirmed that there were no conditions—such as extreme intoxication, injury, or physical restraint—that would have prevented her from escaping when the fire broke out.

Consequently, Haruko’s theory—that the fire was a case of arson intended to cover up a murder—was completely overturned. The death of Shinko Ajigawa was officially ruled a tragic, yet ordinary, accidental death caused by a fire.

Miyoko was released, and the investigation was closed. Yet, despite the data, a nagging doubt remained in a corner of Haruko's mind.
"Sister, you’re making such a stubbornly dissatisfied face," her younger brother, Goro, remarked. Ignoring him, Haruko remained lost in thought, an unresolved expression on her face. Suddenly, she headed for the Forensics Department.
"Listen, could you check the victim's bedding from yesterday's fire one more time?" she asked.

Haruko managed to persuade the Forensics Chief, an old acquaintance, to perform a microscopic examination. While she waited, a young officer arrived to tell her that Chief Hongo was calling for her. In the Chief's office, she found the recently released Tsuruhashi.
"Chief, did you need me?"
"Have a seat. This young man came back to report something he’d forgotten. He says Miyoko Sakuramiya might be suicidal. Apparently, when he visited Shinko yesterday, she had a headache, so he gave her some medicine he had on hand. He claims it was a potent drug containing Phenobarbital. It takes about 30 to 40 minutes to break down in the stomach and be absorbed into the system. Since it's a blood toxin, it causes post-mortem lividity to appear bright red—much like carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning. He says that, based on his pharmacological knowledge, even if a body is found in a fire, forensics could easily be misled by those marks."

"He also claims Miyoko confessed to him that she and Shinko were in a bitter conflict over a lover. She supposedly said she intended to kill Shinko and then herself to settle the 'wicked affair.'"
"But that makes no sense!" Haruko countered sharply. "The autopsy found nothing in the stomach. Soluble Phenobarbital isn't a slow-acting poison like that. And besides, isn't it convenient that he 'forgot' to mention such a crucial detail until now?"

Her sharp logic made Tsuruhashi flinch. Just then, a forensics officer burst in.
"Haruko-san, you were right! We're officially declaring this a homicide."
The Chief’s eyes nearly popped out of his head. "What? Homicide?"
"We detected kerosene on the bedding and the victim's skin. We believe the victim was stripped naked, doused in kerosene, and set ablaze. The autopsy shows a large amount of soot inhaled deep into the lungs, and a neighbor, Tai Ichio, testified to smelling a foul odor. It all fits."

Annoyed that the case had flipped back to a murder investigation, the Chief turned roughly on Tsuruhashi. "Was there kerosene in that room?"
"Kerosene? Now that you mention it, I think I saw a can of oil near the sink..."
Another officer rushed in. "Chief, new information. Hatsue Tamatsukuri, who went mad from a brain ailment, has reportedly committed suicide by jumping from the roof of Akebono Hospital."
"When?"
"Just after noon yesterday. Also, a Mr. Terada, who lives about a thousand paces north of the fire, reported a missing gasoline can from his Datsun truck. He didn't notice it during the fire yesterday but found it gone this morning."

"The pieces are falling into place," the Chief muttered. "Miyoko leaves her apartment at 7:30, parts with Tsuruhashi, steals gasoline from Terada's Datsun, crosses the vacant lot to Ichiraku-so... She climbs the back ladder, finds Shinko suffering from the drugs, strips her, douses her in gasoline, and lights it... It’s all coming together! Get a message to Detective Ebie, who's tailing Miyoko. Arrest her immediately!"
The Chief was suddenly full of energy, but a phone call seconds later turned his face as many colors as a turkey's.
"What? Ebie? ... What? Miyoko committed suicide with what looks like cyanide? I’m coming right now!"
An officer, fearing the Chief's explosive temper, was already on the phone ordering a car from the garage.

"After leaving headquarters, she and Tsuruhashi entered a coffee shop in front of the Prefectural Office..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into four vertical columns of text, a standard format for Japanese literary magazines (*zasshi*) of the mid-20th century.
*   **Illustration:** A black-and-white line drawing occupies the lower-left center. It depicts a dramatic scene—possibly a discovery of the crime or an investigation scene—featuring characters in Showa-era attire (trench coats, hats). The style is reminiscent of "ero-guro-nansen-su" or standard detective pulp illustrations.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a traditional Mincho typeface. Furigana (small phonetic characters) are used sparingly for difficult kanji like 焚殺 (*funsatzu* - burning to death) and 跡迹 (*atoi* - traces).
*   **Structure:** The narrative uses heavy dialogue interspersed with exposition. The title of the chapter, "1-1=0," appears at the bottom right, suggesting a mathematical or logical theme to the mystery.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text flows from right to left, top to bottom. The illustration serves as a visual anchor to break up the dense text.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The mention of a "Datsun" (an early Japanese automobile brand) and the general tone of the police investigation point to the post-war Showa period. This was the "Golden Age" of Japanese detective fiction, heavily influenced by Edogawa Rampo and Seishi Yokomizo.
*   **Scientific Mystery:** The text focuses heavily on "forensics" (*kansshiki*), "autopsy" (*kaibō*), and specific poisons (*Phenobarbital*, *Potassium Cyanide*). This reflects a fascination with "scientific detection" popular in 1950s pulp fiction.
*   **Language:** The use of historical kana (*ゐ*, *ゑ*, *てゐる*) was common until the late 1940s, though some authors/publishers maintained older orthography into the 50s. The dialogue includes some Kansai-inflected forms (e.g., *調べてくれはらへん？*), suggesting the setting might be Osaka or Kobe (frequent settings for such noir-style stories).
*   **Social Morality:** The term *邪恋* (wicked/improper love) and the mention of *異性問題* (problems with the opposite sex) reflect the era's social views on scandal and romantic conflict as primary motives for crime.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **焚殺 (Funsatsu):** An archaic or literary term for killing someone by burning.
*   **跡迹 (Atoi/Atokei):** Traces or evidence. The furigana specifies the reading *atoi*.
*   **青酸加里 (Seisan Kari):** Potassium Cyanide. "Kari" is the phonetic representation of "Kali" (Kalium).
*   **気圧の谷 (Kiatsu no Tani):** Literally "a trough of low pressure." Used here metaphorically to describe the Chief's foul or volatile mood.
*   **道具建 (Dōgu-date):** Normally means stage setting or props. Here used to mean that the "pieces of the puzzle" or "evidence" are coming together.
*   **七面鳥のように三転 (Shichimenchō no yō ni santen):** "Changing like a turkey." A Japanese idiom referring to a face turning red/flushed with anger or agitation, as a turkey's wattle changes color.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Rational vs. The Intuitive:** Haruko represents the intuitive female detective who senses something is wrong despite the "scientific" data, eventually leading to the correction of the forensic report.
*   **Forensic Fallibility:** The story plays with the idea that science can be used to mask a crime (the use of Phenobarbital to mimic post-mortem lividity). It suggests that forensics is only as good as the investigator's eye.
*   **Tragedy of the "Double Suicide":** The plot involves a supposed murder-suicide pact, a recurring trope in Japanese "Shinju" literature, updated here with a cold-blooded forensic twist.
*   **Pace of Modernization:** The mention of the Datsun and telephone communication highlights the modernizing urban environment of the time, where cars and technology become both tools for crime and tools for detection.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Mystery, Detective Noir.
*   **Primary Tags:** Homicide, Arson, Forensics, Showa Era, Poison, Police Procedural.
*   **Classification:** Literary (Popular fiction/Pulp).
