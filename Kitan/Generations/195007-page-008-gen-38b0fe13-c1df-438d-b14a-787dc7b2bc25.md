## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

1. Husband says he wants moxibustion applied. In moxibustion, there is a precept of three before and seven after. Three days before and seven days after moxa, there is nightly restraint. (Handwritten): Try getting into the spirit of sleeping separately for seven days.
2. If I ask my wife for moxa, she is laughing. (Typeset): If you don't restrain that, the precious moxa becomes a waste. Can you keep that? This is the face of a laughing wife. "Can you endure such patience? I'm worried. But I can't beat the stiff shoulders..."
3. Nakajō-ryū (Nakajo style). (Handwritten): After one month, returning to Nakajo with the same face. (Typeset): Once, went to Nakajo but didn't achieve the goal; the belly is protruding more and more. This is trouble, so after five months, again in Nakajo's care. Nakajo: a female doctor specializing in abortion. "Now that it's swollen like this, it's too late. If only you came earlier..."
4. (Handwritten): Anyway, the moment the obi (sash) was removed. Long hallway/Lady's quarters. (Typeset): Discovery of a secret meeting. It feels like the wife is having an affair like a concubine. "Now that it's come to this, I can't run or hide. Please do as your heart desires..."
5. (Handwritten): New Constitution - "It's freedom," she says while pouting in bed. (Typeset): Gender equality. If you have a concubine, there is a reason that I also have the right to have an affair.
6. (Handwritten): Hospitalized for three days, returning with a cool (unfazed) face. OB/GYN. (Typeset): That girl was surely "belly-full" (pregnant), but I wonder when she "disposed" of it. Oh, she took two or three days off saying she was sick. Was it then?
7. (Handwritten): Love-sickness. I can only be impressed with a "hoh." (Typeset): A girl's love-sickness? This kind of thing is rare these days. It's totally Meiji-style.
8. (Handwritten): The mother is also lost in thought together. (Typeset): Oh, that girl has love-sickness? What a feudalistic girl.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

1. **The Ritual of the Burn:** The husband asks his wife to apply moxa. But there’s a rule: "Three days before, seven days after." Total abstinence. The wife smirks, thinking: *Let's see him try to sleep alone for a full week.*
2. **The Wife's Smirk:** She laughs as she applies the moxa. Without restraint, the treatment is useless. Can he actually hold back? She worries for him, but his shoulders are just too stiff to ignore.
3. **The Back-Alley Clinic:** Back at the "Nakajo-style" clinic after a month with the same desperate look. She tried once and failed; now, at five months, her belly is showing. The abortionist sighs, "It's too far gone now. You should have come sooner."
4. **Caught in the Act:** The secret is out—caught just as the kimono sash was undone. The wife’s affair is exposed. She doesn't flinch: "No use hiding now. Do whatever you like with me."
5. **Constitutional Rights:** Invoking the New Constitution, the wife stays in bed, pouting. "Gender equality, dear. If you get to keep a mistress, then I have every right to my own little flings."
6. **The Three-Day 'Sick' Leave:** She was definitely pregnant, but she’s back after a three-day "hospitalization" looking like nothing happened. "So that's what those 'sick days' were for," the neighbors whisper.
7. **An Old-Fashioned Ailment:** Love-sickness? How quaint. You don't see that much these days—it's practically a relic of the Meiji era.
8. **Feudal Heart:** The mother joins her daughter in her brooding. To suffer for love in this day and age? "How terribly old-fashioned of her," people say.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is organized into a grid of illustrated panels (koma-e), a precursor to modern manga. It flows from top-right to bottom-left.
*   **Typography:** Each panel features two distinct styles of text:
    *   **Large Script:** Handwritten with a brush-like aesthetic, providing a punchy title or a summary of the action.
    *   **Typeset Captions:** Smaller, printed text provides the dialogue or narrative exposition.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustrations are the focal point, depicting intimate or scandalous domestic scenes. The text provides the "punchline" or the social commentary.
*   **Art Style:** The drawings are in a post-war "Ponchi-e" style—expressive, slightly caricatured, and emphasizing the fashion (kimonos and western hairstyles) of the late 1940s.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Post-War Era (Late 1940s):** The mention of the **"New Constitution" (新憲法)** refers to the 1947 Constitution of Japan, which famously introduced "Gender Equality" (男女同権). This text satirizes how ordinary citizens interpreted "freedom" as a license for marital infidelity.
*   **Nakajō-ryū (中條流):** Historically, this was a famous school of obstetrics during the Edo period that became synonymous with abortion services. In the post-war era, before the Eugenic Protection Act was fully settled, "Nakajo" remained a euphemism for back-alley or specialized abortion clinics.
*   **Moxibustion (Kyū):** A traditional medical practice involving burning dried mugwort on the skin. The "three before, seven after" rule reflects traditional folk beliefs regarding the purity of the body during treatment.
*   **Meiji-style (明治型):** Referring to the Meiji Era (1868–1912). By the late 1940s, "Meiji-style" was used pejoratively or nostalgically to mean "old-fashioned" or "excessively sentimental/feudal."
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This content is typical of "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, pulp publications that flourished during the occupation. They focused on "the three S's": Sport, Screen (movies), and Sex, often using satire to navigate the crumbling of old morals.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **前三後七 (Zen-san Go-shichi):** A traditional taboo period (3 days before, 7 days after) often applied to religious rites or medical treatments like moxibustion.
*   **不貞寝 (Futenere):** To go to bed in a sulk or to feign sleep out of spite/protest.
*   **腹ボテ (Harabote):** A slang term for being pregnant (literally "belly-bulge"), often used in a slightly vulgar or disparaging way.
*   **仕末 (Shimatsu):** Here used as a euphemism for "dealing with" or "getting rid of" an unwanted pregnancy.
*   **男女同権 (Danjo Dōken):** Equal rights for men and women. A buzzword of the post-war democratization.
*   **妾 (Mekake):** A mistress or concubine. The text highlights the shift from the accepted feudal practice of men having mistresses to the new "equality" where women might do the same.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Collision of Old and New:** The text mocks the awkward transition from "feudal" (Meiji/Edo) values to "democratic" (Post-war) ones. It suggests that people are using "freedom" and "the Constitution" as excuses for age-old human follies like adultery.
*   **Sexual Liberation vs. Reality:** While the text discusses "freedom" and "equality," it also touches on the dark reality of unwanted pregnancies and the "Nakajo" clinics, showing that social liberation had messy, physical consequences.
*   **Satire of Domestic Life:** The husband is portrayed as weak or easily manipulated by his physical needs, while the women are portrayed as increasingly assertive, utilizing the "New Constitution" to challenge traditional male dominance.
*   **Dialect and Class:** The use of Kansai-inflected endings (*~dasse*, *~sharo*) suggests a "shitamachi" (downtown/working class) or pleasure-district setting, adding a layer of grit and realism to the humor.
