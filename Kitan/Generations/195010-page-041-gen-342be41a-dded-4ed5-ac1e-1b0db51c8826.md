## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

奥の方から、ジョホーラの甘つたるい声がした。
「俺だよ、ポリーシーのドラ」
「あら、トアン、お這入りなさいな」
「いいのかい？　へへへ、貧乏人はこんな家は這入りにくくつてな」
静かに扉を開けて、一歩部屋に這入つた。と、ドラが、突然、眼を丸くして立ち止つた。
ジョホーラは、昼寝をしていたらしくピンクのサロンひとつきりで寝台に横たわり、大きな　ふわふわした枕に肘をついて、ピョンと飛び出たお乳も露わな上半身をくねらせてなまめかしく笑つている。
「こりや、たまらねえ」
「ほほほ、いいぢやないの、トアーンおかけなさいな」
ジョホーラは、透き通るような白のバジュ（上衣）をとつて、琥珀（こはく）の裸身にまとおうと、寝台からふわリと降り立つた。
「アリ一、おまえも這いれよ」
「はい、トアン」
アリーが、恐ろしく長たらしい顔で這入つてきた。
「まあ〜、アリーもきてくれたの、さあ、おかけ」
「おつと、ジョホーラ、じつは、ちよつと聞きてえことがあつてやつてきただけなんだ」
「まあ、聞きたいつて、どんなことなの？」
ジョホーラは仕方なしに椅子にかけた。
「じつは、これだがな」

（中略・イラスト部分）
エカンの女房
ベツ甲細工師 ハシム
パンパン ジョホーラ
（下図の）アリー

ドラは、指輪を出してみせた。
「あら、この指輪はアリーにやつたんぢやないの、アリーは、あたしとおなじみなし児ぢやないの、弟だと思つてんのよ、だから、トアンムスキタの家のバブと結婚したいというから、この指輪をあげたのよ、ね、アリー」
「うん、それなのに、トアンドラは、俺が盗んだと思つて――」
アリーは、悲しそうな眼でジョホーラをみつめながらいつた。
「そうかい、そりや悪かつたなあ、しかし、ジョホーラ、その指輪、どこで手に入れた？」
「――」

まさか、おめが盗むとは思われないがなあ、いつてくれ、誰から貰つたかを――」
すると、ジョホーラの美しい睫毛にチカツと涙が光つた。
「トアン、あたし、あたし、ハシムのを盗んぢやつたの」
「な、なんだ！？」
と、ジョホーラが、美しい顔を悲痛に歪めたと思つたら、突然、両手で顔を掩つて泣き崩れた。
ドラは、呆然とした。
「ふうむ……これは、ハシムのかな？　この間盗まれたといってたが……しかし指輪くらいきるほど持つているジョホーラが盗むてのが分らねえ」
ドラは、腕組みして首をひねつた。
「よし！　ハシムに聞いてみりや分かるだろう」
そうつぶやいてドラは、
「ジョホーラ、邪魔したな」
立上つて出てゆこうとすると、ジョホーラが、涙で白粉（おしろい）の剝げた顔をあげて叫んだ
「トアン！　どこへゆくの？」
「ハシムの家だ」
「駄目ッ、いっちゃ駄目、ね、お願いここへ呼んできてちょうだい、あたしトアンに聞いていただきたいことがあるんだから」
「？――そうか、ぢや、アリー、ハシムを呼んできてくれ」
「はい、トアン」
ひと廻りしても半時間とかからない島だから、アリーは、すぐに鼈甲細工師のハシムを連れてひきかえしてきた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

From the back direction, Johola's cloyingly sweet voice did.
"It is me, Dora of the Police."
"Oh, Tuan, please enter."
"Is it okay? Hehehe, for a poor person, such a house is difficult to enter."
Quietly opening the door, one step into the room entered. Then, Dora, suddenly, eyes making round, stood still.
Johola, appearing to have been napping, with only one pink sarong was lying on the bed, leaning an elbow on a large fluffy pillow, with breasts popping out exposed, twisting her upper body, seductively laughing.
"This, [I] can't stand it [too good]."
"Ho ho ho, isn't it fine? Tuan, please sit."
Johola, taking a transparent-like white baju (upper garment), intending to wrap it around her amber naked body, from the bed lightly stepped down.
"Ali, you also enter."
"Yes, Tuan."
Ali, with a frighteningly long face, entered.
"Oh, Ali also came for me? Come, sit."
"Whoa, Johola, actually, just a thing [I] want to ask about and came here, that is all."
"Well, saying you want to ask, what kind of thing is it?"
Johola, having no choice, sat in a chair.
"Actually, it's about this."

(Illustrations)
Ekan's Wife
Tortoiseshell craftsman Hashim
Panpan Johola
(Of the diagram below) Ali

Dora, a ring taking out, showed.
"Oh, this ring, didn't I give it to Ali? Ali is, like me, an orphan, isn't he? I think of him as a younger brother. So, because he said he wants to marry Babu of Tuan Muskita's house, I gave this ring. Right, Ali?"
"Yeah, despite that, Tuan Dora, thought that I stole it—"
Ali, with sad eyes at Johola gazing, said.
"Is that so? That was bad [my mistake]. But, Johola, that ring, where did you get it in hand?"
"..."
"Surely, it is not thought that you would steal, but... tell me, from whom you received it—"
Then, on Johola's beautiful eyelashes, a "chika" [flash] tear shone.
"Tuan, I, I, stole Hashim's."
"W-what!?"
Then, Johola, just as her beautiful face in pain distorted, suddenly, with both hands face covering, broke down crying.
Dora was stunned.
"Hmm... is this Hashim's? He said it was stolen recently... but Johola, who has rings enough to rot, stealing is something I don't understand."
Dora, arms crossing, tilted his head.
"Alright! If [I] try asking Hashim, [I] will likely understand."
So muttering, Dora,
"Johola, [I] disturbed you [excuse me]."
Standing up to go out, Johola, with a face where powder was peeled by tears, raised and screamed:
"Tuan! Where are you going?"
"Hashim's house."
"No! Don't go. Hey, please, call him here. I have something I want Tuan to hear."
"? -- I see. Then, Ali, go call Hashim."
"Yes, Tuan."
Since it is an island that doesn't take even half an hour to go around, Ali immediately brought back the tortoiseshell craftsman Hashim.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

From the inner rooms came the sultry, honeyed voice of Johola. 
"It’s me, Dora. From the police."
"Oh, Tuan, do come in."
"You sure? Heh, a poor man like me feels out of place entering a house like this."
Dora pushed the door open quietly and stepped inside, only to freeze in his tracks, eyes wide with surprise. Johola appeared to have been napping; she lay across the bed clad only in a pink sarong. Propped up on a large, plush pillow, she twisted her torso seductively, her breasts partially exposed, and gave him a flirtatious laugh.
"Lord, I can't take this," Dora muttered.
"Ho ho ho! Don't be like that, Tuan. Have a seat."
Johola reached for a sheer white *baju* to cover her amber-toned skin and glided off the bed. 
"Ali, you come in too," Dora called out.
"Yes, Tuan," Ali replied, shuffling in with a long, somber face.
"My, Ali, you’ve come to see me too? Sit, sit."
"Wait a second, Johola. Truth is, I only came because there's something I need to ask you."
"Oh? And what might that be?"
With a reluctant sigh, Johola took a seat. 
"It's about this," Dora said, producing a ring. 

"Oh, that? Didn't I give that to Ali? He's an orphan just like me—I think of him as a brother. He said he wanted to marry the girl Babu over at Tuan Muskita's place, so I gave it to him as a gift. Right, Ali?"
"Yeah," Ali said, staring at Johola with mournful eyes. "But Tuan Dora here thought I’d gone and stolen it."
"I see. My mistake then," Dora said. "But Johola... where exactly did *you* get that ring?"
Johola fell silent.
"I can't imagine you'd be a thief, but... tell me. Who gave it to you?"
A single tear glistened on Johola's long lashes. 
"Tuan... I... I stole it from Hashim."
"What!?"
Johola’s beautiful face contorted in agony, and she suddenly collapsed into a fit of sobbing, burying her face in her hands. Dora stood there, dumbfounded. 
*Hmm... so it really is Hashim's? He did mention it was missing. But why would Johola, who has enough jewelry to sink a ship, bother stealing a ring? It makes no sense.*
Dora crossed his arms, pondering. "Fine. I'll just go ask Hashim myself."
"Sorry for the intrusion, Johola," he muttered, turning to leave.
Johola looked up, her face streaked with tears and smeared makeup. "Tuan! Where are you going?" she screamed.
"To Hashim's house."
"No! You can't! Please, just call him here instead. There's something I... I need you to hear, Tuan."
Dora paused. "I see. Ali, go fetch Hashim."
"Right away, Tuan."
The island was small enough to traverse in less than thirty minutes. It wasn't long before Ali returned with Hashim, the tortoiseshell craftsman, in tow.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This is a classic "serial novel" (renzoku shosetsu) layout typical of Japanese pulp or general-interest magazines of the mid-20th century.
*   **Typography:** The text is set in vertical columns (tategaki). It uses standard Mincho-style typeface. Small *furigana* (ruby text) are provided for less common kanji (like 琥珀 - amber, 睫毛 - eyelashes, 鼈甲 - tortoiseshell) to ensure readability for a general audience.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the segment or series ("エカンの女房" - Ekan's Wife) and character names are placed near the illustrations to help the reader identify the players in the scene. 
*   **Illustrations:** The drawings are in a "modern" post-war style, showing a mix of Western-influenced fashion (Johola's hairstyle) and local/tropical elements (the sarong, the man's headgear). The labels for the characters (Hashim, Johola, Ali, Dora) serve as a visual dramatis personae.
*   **Punctuation:** The text uses Japanese quotation marks (「 」), and repetition marks (々). It reflects the orthography of the era where some small kana (like っ) were occasionally written full-size, though this specific scan looks relatively modernized.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII):** The mention of "Panpan" (パンパン) is a dead giveaway for the late 1940s/early 1950s. While "Panpan" usually referred to Japanese streetwalkers catering to US GIs, here it is used as a label for Johola, suggesting a similar social status—a woman of the night in a colonial/occupied setting.
*   **Setting:** The names (Johola/Johore, Tuan, Hashim, Ali, Baju, Sarong) strongly suggest a setting in British Malaya or the Dutch East Indies. During and after WWII, Japanese literature often featured stories set in the "Southern Seas" (Nanyo), reflecting the recent history of Japanese occupation in those regions.
*   **"Tuan":** A Malay/Indonesian honorific meaning "Sir" or "Master." Its frequent use by Ali and Johola toward Dora suggests Dora holds a position of authority, likely as a colonial or occupying police official.
*   **Pulp Noir Influence:** The story contains classic noir tropes: a beautiful but potentially dishonest woman, a missing piece of jewelry, a detective/policeman figure, and a "younger brother" character caught in the middle.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **甘つたるい (Amattarui):** Modern: 甘ったるい. Means "cloying," "saccharine," or "sultry/coquettish" when describing a voice.
*   **サロン (Sarong):** A traditional garment wrapped around the waist, common in Southeast Asia.
*   **バジュ (Baju):** Malay for "clothing/shirt." In Japanese colonial literature, it specifically refers to the thin upper garments worn in the tropics.
*   **鼈甲 (Bekkō):** Tortoiseshell. A high-value craft material in the mid-20th century.
*   **白粉 (Oshiroi):** Traditional face powder. The mention of it "peeling" or "smearing" due to tears emphasizes the theatricality and tragic state of Johola.
*   **腐るほど (Kusaru hodo):** Idiom meaning "to have so much of something that it rots"—essentially "to have loads" or "more than one knows what to do with."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eroticism & Exoticism:** The detailed description of Johola's partially exposed body and her "amber" skin reflects the *ero-guro-nansensu* (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) legacy in Japanese pulp fiction, using a foreign setting to heighten the sense of the "exotic other."
*   **Class and Poverty:** Dora’s comment about a "poor man" entering such a nice house highlights the wealth disparity between the police/working class and the successful "Panpan" girls or merchants.
*   **The "Fallen Woman" Archetype:** Johola is depicted as beautiful and maternal (treating Ali as a brother) but also morally compromised (stealing despite being wealthy). Her breakdown suggests a hidden secret or a sacrifice she is making for someone else.
*   **Post-War Guilt/Suspicion:** The theme of theft and the police investigation mirrors the chaotic social climate of the immediate post-war period where survival often meant turning to the black market or crime.
