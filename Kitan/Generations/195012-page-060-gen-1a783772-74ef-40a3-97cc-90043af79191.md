この、狸婆奴ッ！
ほんとの親なら、たとえ、こうでも
いやらしい惡感を覺えないが――そこに繼母だ。
信二は、部屋の中程まで立て止り
思いきつて
「お母さん、誰か、いましたね？」
ぎよつと振りむいた義母の顔、裏戶
を開けたときと同じ大きな眼で
「え？――」
濡れた、黒い瞳の奥に、狼狽の色を
漂わせ
「変なこというもんじやない」
「いいえ、誰か、いました。裏戶が、
開いた音も、家から出た男の姿も見え
ました――」
すうつと度胸が据つてきた。つか
／＼と義母の前へにじり寄り、信二は
鋭く
「母さんッ」
予期していたものの義母は、瞳も、
頰も、恐怖にひきつらせ、額にあて
ていた手で、火箸を握つたが、少し震
えている。
「僕、変な噂を聞いたんですが――ほ
んとうですか？――お父さんの留守中
に、いいのですか？――」
「どうしたんだえ、おまえ、たとえ、
いま、誰かきていたとしても――。あ
たしも、こんな年で、なにも、お父さ
んの名誉にかかわるような、変な眞似
ができるものかね、お母さんわね、は
やく、おまえが身を固めてくれるよう
にと、そればつかし思つて――そりや
世間ぢや、義理の母だとか、なんだと
か、嫌な噂をたてるけれど、いいたい
人はいいわしてお
くがいい、いち／＼
いちいち構つていら
や、躰がいくつ
あつても足りや
しない、ね、ど
んなことを聞い
てきたか知らな
いけど――」
「僕も、噂を、
眞に受けてるわ
けぢやないです
――しかし、火
のない所に煙は
――」
「それが立つも
のだよ、お母さ
んほ、いままで
おまえに、継母
みたい、ひどい
仕打ちをしたか
え？」
「それや――しかし――」
「したのかえ？――はつきりいつてご
らん、あたしは――あたしは――」
袖口で、眼を拭き、鼻をすすつて、
涙声で
「いちどだつて、おまえを、継子と思
つたことがありません、それに、世間
は、ふたことめに信二さんが可愛相だ
～と、それでも、あたしは、じつと
我慢してるんですよ」
「分つています、お母さんのご恩は、
忘れませんが――」
信二が七つのとき、大きな、呉服屋
の娘だつた、その頃の義母は、蔭で、
因業な金貸をしている、父のために、
いつもまとまつた談談が破談になり、
厳格な躾で、内気な彼女は、二十九の
齢で、無口で陰気な娘になつていたの
を、信二の父が、病死した妻のあとも
にと、親域の仲立ちで娶つたが、最初
の予想通り温順しく、また、子種がな
いので、先妻の子の信二を、まるで実
子のように可愛がつた。で、信二もな
ついていたが、実母の印象が中々抜け
切らず、どつちかというと、神経質で
癇の高い信二は、ちよつとしたことを
変に、ひねくれてとり義母を怨んだり
なにか、しつくりしないものを感じ、
いま義母に、ご恩は忘れまさんといつ
た、その言葉自体も、実母に対するも
のではないと、信二は悲しく、白々し
い気持になるのであつた。

**二、父と子**

「ね、信二さん、あたしは、どれだけ
あなたのことを――」
さつき、でるとき、いつた義母の言
葉に
「ふん、さんつけに、あなた呼ばわり
それが気にくわん――」
信二は、家を出てから、考えこみな
がら、いつの問にか、真つ直ぐに父の
いつている大学に向つて歩いているの
に気がつき
「会社は休んでやれ、父に会つて、話
してやろう」
ポクツトに入れていた手を出して、
顔を上げ、足をはやめて、アスファル
トの並木道を急いで歩いた。
煉瓦造りの、古風な、堂々とした建
物の、勝手知つた職員室へ這入ると、顔
みしりの教授が、愛想よく笑顔をむけ
てくれ、机に、どつしりとかけて、莨
をくゆらしながら、傍の若い教授達と
雑談を交している父の所へすぐ告げて
くれた。
「ちよつと、話が――」
声をひそめた、信二の態度に、なに

さっき出る時に言った義母の言葉に、

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

This, fox-witch-hag!
If it were a real parent, even if [it were] like this, a disgusting bad feeling one would not feel—but therein [is the] stepmother.
Shinji, until the middle of the room stood still, taking a risk:
"Mother, someone was here, wasn't there?"
The face of the stepmother who turned around with a start, with large eyes the same as when she opened the back door:
"Eh? —"
Deep in the wet, black pupils, letting a color of agitation drift:
"Don't say strange things."
"No, someone was here. The sound of the back door opening, and the figure of a man who left the house, I saw —"
Steadily, his courage became set. Stride by stride, edging closer to the stepmother, Shinji sharply:
"Mother!"
Though having anticipated it, the stepmother, both pupils and cheeks twitching with fear, with the hand she had held to her forehead, she gripped the fire tongs, but they are trembling a little.
"I, heard a strange rumor—is it true? —while Father is away, is it alright? —"
"What is the matter, you, even if, now, someone had come —. I too, at this age, anything, like something that affects Father's honor, such strange behavior, how could I do such a thing? Mother, you see, quickly, for you to settle down, that is all I have thought —That's right, in the world, 'stepmother' or whatever, they start nasty rumors, but people who want to talk should be let talk, if I minded every little thing, no matter how many bodies I had it wouldn't be enough, right? I don't know what kind of things you heard, but —"
"I too, the rumors, it's not that I'm taking them as truth —however, where there's no fire, smoke —"
"That's what rises. Has Mother, until now toward you, like a stepmother, done any cruel treatment?"
"That is—however—"
"Did I? —Tell me clearly. I—I—"
With her sleeve, wiping her eyes, sniffing her nose, with a tearful voice:
"Not even once, have I thought of you as a stepchild. Moreover, the world, with every second word says 'Poor Shinji-san,' even so, I, am constantly enduring."
"I understand. Mother's kindness, I won't forget, but —"
When Shinji was seven, she was the daughter of a large kimono shop. The stepmother of that time, because of her father who did harsh moneylending in the shadows, always had settled marriage talks end in broken engagements. With strict upbringing, the shy her, at the age of twenty-nine, had become a quiet and gloomy woman. Shinji's father, as a successor to his wife who died of illness, through a relative's mediation married her. But as first predicted she was gentle, and moreover, because she had no 'child-seed' (biological children), she loved the previous wife's child Shinji just like a real child. And so, Shinji also was attached, but the impression of his real mother did not quite leave him, and if anything, the sensitive and short-tempered Shinji, would take small things strangely, perversely, and resent the stepmother, feeling something that didn't quite fit. The words just now to the stepmother, "I won't forget your kindness," even those words themselves, because they weren't for his real mother, Shinji became sad, and felt a hollow, hypocritical feeling.

**2. Father and Son**

"Hey, Shinji-san, I, how much I [care] for you —"
At the words the stepmother said earlier when leaving:
"Hmph, attaching 'San,' calling me 'Anata' (dear/you), I don't like that —"
Shinji, after leaving the house, while brooding, before he knew it, noticed he was walking straight toward the university where his father goes:
"I'll skip the company, meet Father, and talk."
Taking out the hand he had in his pocket, raising his face, quickening his step, he walked hurriedly on the asphalt tree-lined road.
Entering the faculty room he knew well in the brick-built, old-fashioned, grand building, a professor he knew turned an amiable smile toward him, and immediately told his father, who was sitting heavily at a desk, puffing on tobacco while exchanging idle talk with the young professors nearby.
"A little, the talk is —"
At Shinji's attitude of lowering his voice, feeling something not normal, the father led Shinji to the reception room.
"What happened? The company? —"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"You sly old fox!" Shinji thought. If she were his real mother, a scene like this wouldn't fill him with such a foul sense of revulsion—but she was his stepmother.

Shinji stopped dead in the middle of the room. Bracing himself, he spoke. "Mother, someone was just here, weren't they?"

His stepmother whirled around, her face frozen in a look of shock. Her eyes were as wide as they had been when she’d slipped open the back door. In the depths of those moist, dark eyes, a flash of panicked agitation flickered.

"Don't go saying such ridiculous things," she stammered.

"No, someone was here. I heard the back door open, and I saw a man's figure leaving the house."

Shinji felt a sudden surge of cold courage. He closed the distance between them, looming over her. "Mother!" he barked.

Though she must have expected the confrontation, she was visibly trembling. Her cheeks twitched with terror. She reached for the fire tongs with the same hand she’d been holding to her forehead, but her grip was unsteady.

"I've heard rumors, Mother. Tell me, are they true? Is this what you do while Father is away at work?"

"What has gotten into you, Shinji? Even if someone *had* come by... I'm at an age where I wouldn't dream of doing anything to tarnish your father's honor. All I think about is seeing you settled down with a family of your own. Of course, people love to gossip about stepmothers, but you have to let them talk. If I let every rumor get to me, I wouldn't have a moment's peace. I don't know what lies you've been told, but..."

"I don't necessarily believe everything I hear," Shinji interrupted. "But as they say, there's no smoke without fire."

"And that’s exactly what's happening now—smoke without a fire. Tell me, have I ever been anything but kind to you? Have I ever treated you like the 'wicked stepmother' from the stories?"

"Well... no, but..."

"Have I? Say it clearly! I... I..." She began to wipe her eyes with her sleeve, her voice cracking into a sob. "I have never once thought of you as anything less than my own son. Meanwhile, the whole world looks at me and says, 'Poor Shinji-san, having her for a mother.' I've had to endure that stigma every single day."

"I know," Shinji said, his voice softening. "I won't forget what I owe you, but..."

When Shinji was seven, she had come to them—the daughter of a prominent kimono merchant. Back then, her own father’s reputation as a ruthless moneylender had caused all her marriage prospects to vanish. Raised under a strict, stifling discipline, she had become a somber, introverted woman of twenty-nine. When Shinji's father sought a second wife after his first passed away, a relative arranged the match. As expected, she was gentle and submissive. Because she was unable to have children of her own, she poured all her affection into Shinji, raising him as if he were her own flesh and blood. 

Shinji had grown fond of her, yet the memory of his biological mother never faded. Naturally high-strung and sensitive, he often found himself resenting her for the smallest slights, a persistent sense of unease lingering between them. Even now, the words "I won't forget what I owe you" felt hollow and bitter. Because they weren't directed at his true mother, the sentiment felt like a betrayal, leaving him with a deep sense of sadness and self-loathing.

**II. Father and Son**

"Oh, Shinji-san, you have no idea how much I..."

As he left the house, her parting words echoed in his mind. "Hmph. 'Shinji-san.' 'Dear.' I can't stand that phony tone," he muttered.

Brooding as he walked, he suddenly realized he had headed straight for the university where his father worked. *I’ll skip work today,* he decided. *I need to see Father and tell him everything.*

He pulled his hands from his pockets, squared his shoulders, and quickened his pace along the tree-lined asphalt path. He entered the grand, old-fashioned brick building and made his way to the faculty lounge. A familiar professor greeted him with a warm smile and pointed toward his father. The older man was perched firmly at a desk, wreathed in tobacco smoke, deep in conversation with some younger colleagues.

"Father, can we talk? It's important," Shinji whispered.

Sensing the gravity in his son's hushed tone, the father stood and led him toward a private reception room. 

"What's wrong? Why aren't you at the office?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Format and Layout
*   **Typography:** The text is set in traditional vertical orientation (*tategaki*). It uses a standard serif typeface typical of Japanese printing from the 1940s-1960s.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the series, **現代好色化物ものがたり** (Modern Amorous Monster Tales), is presented in a bold, stylized, slightly "creepy" or hand-brushed font to the left of the main illustration. Below it is the specific story title: **もだえる女体** (The Writhing Female Body). 
*   **Column Structure:** The text flows from right to left in multiple columns. There is a clear break for the second chapter header, "二、父と子" (Part 2: Father and Son).
*   **Illustration:** A central sketch depicts a woman (the stepmother) in a state of distress or repose on a futon, while a man (Shinji) looks on. The art style is "gekiga-lite"—expressive, slightly eroticized, and melodramatic, typical of the "dregs magazines" (*kasutori zasshi*) of the era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era (Post-WWII / 1950s):** The themes of "modern lust," "stepmothers," and family tension are hallmark traits of post-war popular fiction. Magazines like *Fūsetsu* or *Amour* flourished by providing sensational, often mildly erotic stories for the masses.
*   **The "Stepmother" Trope:** The *継母* (gibo/継母 - stepmother) is a classic figure of suspicion in Japanese literature, often portrayed as either a villain or a victim of social stigma. Here, the story plays with the tension between her apparent kindness and Shinji's deep-seated suspicion.
*   **Marriage Conventions:** The text mentions a *縁談* (endan - marriage proposal/arrangement) mediated by a relative. This reflects the common practice of *omiai* (arranged marriage) during the period, especially for someone like the stepmother who was "past her prime" (at age 29).
*   **Terminology:** The use of "呉服屋" (gofukuya - kimono shop) signifies an old-money merchant background, contrasting with the father's position at a university, which represents the intellectual/professional class.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **狸婆奴 (Tanuki-baba-me/nu):** A highly derogatory term. *Tanuki* (raccoon dog) implies someone cunning or deceptive. *Baba* is "old woman," and *nu/me* is a pejorative suffix.
*   **火箸 (Hibashi):** Metal chopsticks used for handling charcoal in a brazier (*hibachi*). This detail dates the story to an era when traditional heating was still common.
*   **火のない所に煙は (Hi no nai tokoro ni kemuri wa):** The Japanese version of "Where there's smoke, there's fire."
*   **因業 (Ingyō):** Cruel, heartless, or grasping. Specifically used here to describe the stepmother's father's moneylending business.
*   **さん付けにあなた呼ばわり (San-zuke ni anata-yobawari):** Shinji complains about her using the polite "-san" and the term "anata." While "anata" can mean "dear" between spouses, it can also sound overly formal or distant coming from a mother-figure, which Shinji perceives as artificial.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Oedipal Tension & Suspicion:** The text drips with psychological tension. Shinji is hyper-aware of his stepmother's sexuality and potential infidelity, framed as a betrayal of his father.
*   **The "Artificial" Family:** A major theme is the psychological barrier between a stepmother and stepchild. Even when she is "kind," Shinji views her actions through a lens of "hollowness" (*白々しい*), unable to reconcile her with the memory of his "real" mother.
*   **Class and Reputation:** Much of the dialogue revolves around "honor" (*名誉*) and "rumors" (*噂*). The stepmother’s defense is based on her social standing and her age, arguing that her reputation is more important than any fleeting impulse.
*   **Guilt and Resentment:** Shinji feels guilty for resenting her kindness, yet he cannot help but suspect her. This internal conflict drives him to seek his father's counsel.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Serial Novel / Short Story)
*   **Genre:** Pulp Fiction / Drama / Erotica (*Kasutori*)
*   **Themes:** Family conflict, Infidelity, Trauma, Post-war society, Domestic tension
*   **Flags:** Sensationalist, Mildly erotic subtext, Melodrama
