## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

A physical urge, blazing with passion, was upon them. Wakamitsu spread his arms wide and embraced her. And locked in that embrace, they rolled onto the bed.

“Today, I let the maid go to the movies in place of me. It's a world just for the two of us. Let's enjoy this together.”

She reached under the pillow and took out a small, beautiful book.

It was an “Erotic Story” about a young French teacher and the daughter of an old gentleman, whom the young woman spied on as the teacher, completely nude, performed a passionate, fiery scene in the shadow of a wardrobe, inviting his wife to join. As they lay on the bed, she and he (Wakamitsu) grew increasingly excited, leading her further into a state of self-oblivion.

—“A body like the beautiful Venus, surrendering to the freedom of the old gentleman, the young teacher in the bush cover... ‘Please, grandpa-sir, just stay still like that and hold me close,’ she says.” Even the signaling of the cries of pleasure, filled only with this single-minded, ticklish longing, was soon lost in a state of ecstasy...

“Hey. We should hurry and enact it too, shouldn't we? It’s a marvelous art form.”
“Mhm.”
Her thighs grew slick and moist, smooth as milk...

“If I asked you to lick the sole of my foot, would you do it?”
“Ah, that makes me so happy, because you won't marry me sincerely.”
“Yes, let’s marry.”
“Truly? Are you saying that from the heart?”
“I—you see—I have an older sister who had one child. I just couldn't tell you. I feel I cannot live without you, but I don't want to make you a sacrifice.”
“I understand. For your sake, I will gladly become the sacrifice. Because I, too, cannot live without you anymore.”

She pressed her face against Wakamitsu's broad chest. Wakamitsu was deeply, completely in love with her now, seeing her as innocent and lovable as his former mistress.
“There, cheer up. It’s a promise of marriage. Don’t cry...”
Wakamitsu intertwined his pinky with hers, and pressed his lips to her long, moist eyelashes that clustered above her eyes.

“You, there is one more command I want to impose on you, please follow it.”
“What is it?”
“It’s about the handbag. My husband/master...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is an excerpt from a serialized story, printed in the traditional Japanese vertical writing format (*tategaki*).

**Structure and Layout:**
1.  **Vertical Columns:** The text flows from right to left, top to bottom.
2.  **Narrative/Dialogue Interplay:** The narration is interrupted frequently by short lines of dialogue, which are typically enclosed in square corner quotation marks (「」).
3.  **Visual Break/Ellipsis:** The narrative uses multiple dots (…………) extensively to indicate strong emotional pauses, sensual moments, or trailing off of thoughts, characteristic of dramatic literary styles.
4.  **Formatting:** The use of small characters for emphasis (e.g., “エロチック・ストーリイ” uses smaller *i* at the end, “さゝ” uses small *sa* for emphasis) is present.
5.  **Illustration:** A line drawing with gray wash occupies the lower half of the page, directly illustrating the sensual setting described in the text (a reclining, nude or partially clothed figure, possibly the woman reading or reacting to the book).
6.  **Metadata:** The character '光' (Light, or maybe a chapter/section title) is positioned in the upper left of the illustration space. The page number "- 5 -" is centered at the bottom.

**Typography and Orthography:**
The font is a standard Mincho style. Crucially, the text employs **Historical Kana Orthography (歴史的仮名遣い)**, evidenced by spellings like *あつた* (atta), *だつた* (datta), *ゐる* (iru), *いへば* (ieba), and *わたくし* (watakushi). This suggests the publication date is likely pre-1946 reform, or in the immediate post-war period where older standards lingered, placing it roughly in the 1940s to early 1950s.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Publication Era (1940s-1960s):** The use of archaic kana strongly anchors this text to the immediate post-WWII period or earlier. Following Japan's defeat in 1945, there was a period of intense cultural liberalization. The suppression of erotic and sensational literature (*ero-guro*) during the war was lifted, leading to a flourishing of dramatic, passionate, and often explicit stories that explored themes of desire, sacrifice, and complicated relationships—the context of this excerpt perfectly aligns with this trend.

**Genre: Erotic Literature and Romance:** The explicit mention of the "エロチック・ストーリイ" (Erotic Story) being read aloud and serving as a catalyst for the couple's intimacy is significant. This meta-narrative technique highlights the increasing presence and acceptance of sexual themes in popular Japanese fiction during the mid-20th century.

**The Theme of Sacrifice:** The dialogue revolves around profound moral and emotional conflicts. The woman implies she has a past burden (a child from a sister, the "handbag" incident, and the implied need for a "master/husband" or *shujin*). She considers herself an object of "sacrifice" (*gisei*), suggesting a background of difficult social circumstances, possibly debt, a questionable previous marriage, or professional work involving men. The man (Wakamitsu) actively rejects this, promising to marry her and accept the sacrifice himself, transforming a potentially transactional or tainted relationship into one of pure commitment.

**Terminology: "ハンド・バック" (Handbag):** The sudden introduction of the "handbag matter" at the very end, just as a powerful emotional climax (the marriage proposal and declaration of love) is reached, acts as a major cliffhanger. In post-war fiction, a handbag or a specific object often symbolizes a crucial piece of evidence, a debt, or a connection to a dangerous past, suggesting a potential crime, blackmail, or a previous relationship that defines the woman’s current predicament.

| 主人 | しゅじん | Husband, master, or employer. Given the context of the handbag, it likely refers to a former or current male figure controlling the woman's life/finances. | 夫、ご主人様 |

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**The Interplay of Art and Life:** The act of reading the "Erotic Story" (エロチック・ストーリイ) is not just entertainment; it is explicitly a template or prompt for their own sexual interaction ("私たちも、早く実行しましょうよ。素晴らしい芸術をー。"). Sex is elevated to an "art form" (*geijutsu*), positioning the couple's intimacy within a cultural framework that justifies and glorifies their passion.

**Redemption Through Sacrifice:** The central emotional drama concerns the woman’s past, symbolized by her sister’s child and the financial/social baggage ("ハンド・バックの件"). She sees herself as flawed and believes marriage would impose a "sacrifice" on Wakamitsu. Wakamitsu’s passionate declaration—that he, too, cannot live without her and will happily accept the burden—serves as a powerful emotional climax, suggesting that true love transcends social and moral obligations. This trope of salvation through unconditional acceptance is common in romantic fiction dealing with marginalized female characters.

**Power Dynamics and Desire:** The scene is saturated with power dynamics. The opening dialogue involves Wakamitsu granting a small favor (letting the maid go out), creating an intimate "world just for two." The woman initiates the conversation about marriage and later proposes a command ("命令通りにして下さ"), reversing the typical expectation of male dominance, only for the scene to revert to the mystery of the *shujin* (master/husband) and the handbag, re-establishing her subordinate position relative to an external force.
