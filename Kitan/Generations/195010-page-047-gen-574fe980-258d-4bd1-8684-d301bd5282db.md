「ホ、ホ、」
「そう何も恥しがる必要はない。万事は取引じやて。さあ、何処かへ行つて前祝いとしよう――」

ホテルへ走る車の中で

ホテルへ着くと彼女は化粧室へ飛び込んだ。部屋へ戻るとパパは、にや〜しながら上着を脱いでいた。彼女はパパの首へ腕を巻いて
「今夜、わ、た、し、メンスなの」
一週間後の再会を約してホテルを出た。
三百円の広告料と二百円の部屋代で、壹万五千円もする指輪と晩餐と踊りと、一寸スゴイでしょう。
彼女は次のプランを樹てゝいる。

**[Bottom Story: 大枚五枚の唇]**
吉木が、いつものように夜の河岸を散歩していました。すると、岩蔭から突然彼の前へひらつと飛び出した者がいました。はつとした彼が驚いて身構えると
「おほほゝゝゝ、そんなに驚かなくてもいいのよ」
と言つて吉木の側へ寄つてきました。夜目にも美しい娘なので彼は思わずニヤリとしました。
そして若い二人が、肩を並べて歩き出したのは当然です。ところが、その若い女が突然予期しないことを言い出したのです。
「あなた。切符を買つて下さらない？」
「切符つて、何のですか――音楽会ののですか」
「まあ嫌だ、そんな野暮なものじやないわ――、これは、肉体のテイツケトよ」
「ええ？肉体の……」
「そう、一枚五十円よ、一枚いかが」
「しかし、いつたい、そ、それは誰に通用するんですか」
すると、女は默つて自分の唇を指さしました。…………
さて、この翌夜、これを聞いた吉木の悪友四人が隊伍を組んで押しかけて行つたのです。来てみると、その岩蔭には、ゆうべの女が立つて煙草をふかしていました。
「おい、あれだな」
一人が、吉木の肩をそつと押しました。
「うん、あの人だよ」
「美人だなあ」
皆が感心しているすきを見て、一人がいきなり駆け寄ろうとしました。
「おいこすいぞ」
「僕が先だよ」
時ならぬ先陣争いが起りました。すると佇んでいた問題の女はそれを認めるが早いか
「来たわよー」
と俄然大きな叫び声をあげたんです。まさか、そんな大きな声を出すことは思いも寄らなかつた皆が、虚をつかれ、ぽかんとしていると、どや〜と足音がして、怪しげな風態の男が、六七人駈けつけて来ました。
言わずと知れた土地のヨタ者です。暫くして皆の財布が空になつていました。
「どうもありがとう」
女は巻き上げた財布を手にすると、ゆう然と立ち去りました。
「悪く思うなよ」下手の連中が、頸をしやくつて、こう言いました。皆が呆然としてそこにいつ迄も立ちつくしました。やがて気がついたように
「驚いたなア、僕はそんな計画があるとは思わなかつた…」
「キスと言うのは餌だよ」
「損害はいくらだい。皆小使しか持つて来なかつたからよかつたねえ」
「總計四百九十八円……」
「おい、ちよつと待つて、僕は金の外に葉書を一枚持つて行かれたよ」
「何に？葉書――じやあ、〆めて大枚五枚円也か」(終)

**【上の話】**
正体の知れない求婚者が5人ほど押しかけてきたが、「もう約束ができましたから」と断ってしまった。
最後に現れたちょび髭を生やした小太りの50歳くらいの男に、彼女はたまらなく好感を持ってしまった。頭が半分禿げかかっていたが、洋服だって小ざっぱりとして「パパ」と呼ぶにふさわしかった。
差し出した名刺には、「金山商事株式会社 取締役社長 金山好三」とある。
「後援（パトロン）というと、どれくらい必要かな？」
貧しい女流画家の内情を話すと、金山氏はにじり寄ってきた。
「毎月8000円もあれば十分でございます」
「それだけであんたの活殺権をワシが握れるのだな」
「ホ、ホ、」
「そう何も恥ずかしがる必要はない。万事は取引だ。さあ、どこかへ行って前祝いとしよう――」
彼女は罪のないパパと連れ立ってホテルを出ると、心斎橋へ来た。格好いいところを見せようとしているらしい彼は、心斎橋で記念としてダイヤの指輪を買ってくれるというのだ。
それから、久しく行かなかった「光風亭」で、3500円の中華料理（支那料理）に意地汚くパクついた。
少し飲んだ老酒がとても陽気に効いてしまったので、すぐホテル行きを希望しているパパを無理に引っ張って、「フロリダ」でジャンジャン踊ってしまった。
ホテルへ向かう車の中で
「ねえ、パパ、頭がいたいの」
「寝れば良くなるよ」
ホテルに着くと、彼女は化粧室へ飛び込んだ。部屋に戻るとパパは、ニヤニヤしながら上着を脱いでいた。彼女はパパの首に腕を巻きつけて、
「今夜、わ・た・し、生理（メンス）なの」
一週間後の再会を約束してホテルを出た。
300円の広告料と200円の部屋代で、1万5000円もする指輪と晩餐と踊り。ちょっとすごいでしょ？
彼女は次の計画を立てている。

**【大枚五枚の唇】**
吉木がいつものように夜の河岸を散歩していました。すると岩陰から突然、彼の前へひらりと飛び出した者がいました。ハッとした彼が驚いて身構えると、
「オホホ、そんなに驚かなくてもいいのよ」
と言って吉木の側へ寄ってきました。夜目にも美しい娘なので、彼は思わずニヤリとしました。
若い二人が肩を並べて歩き出したのは当然の成り行きです。ところが、その若い女が突然、予期しないことを言い出したのです。
「あなた、切符を買ってくださらない？」
「切符って、何のですか。音楽会のものですか？」
「まあ嫌だ、そんな野暮なものじゃないわ。これは、肉体のチケットよ」
「ええ？ 肉体の……」
「そう、一枚50円よ。一枚いかが？」
「しかし、一体それは誰に通用するんですか？」
すると、女は黙って自分の唇を指差しました。
さて、この翌夜。これを聞いた吉木の悪友4人が隊列を組んで押しかけて行ったのです。行ってみると、その岩陰には昨夜の女が立ってタバコをふかしていました。
「おい、あれだな」
一人が吉木の肩をそっと押しました。
「うん、あの人だよ」
「美人だなあ」
皆が感心している隙を見て、一人がいきなり駆け寄ろうとしました。
「おい、ずるいぞ」
「僕が先だ」
突然の先陣争いが始まりました。すると、佇んでいた問題の女はそれを認めるやいなや、
「来たわよー！」
と突然大きな叫び声を上げたのです。そんな大声を出すとは思いも寄らなかった一行が、虚を突かれて呆然としていると、「ドヤドヤ」と足音がして、怪しげな風体の男が6、7人駆けつけてきました。
言わずと知れた地元のならず者（ヨタ者）です。しばらくして、皆の財布は空になっていました。
「どうもありがとう」
女は巻き上げた財布を手にすると、悠然と立ち去りました。
「悪く思うなよ」
下っ端の連中が首をすくめて言いました。皆が呆然として、いつまでも立ち尽くしていました。やがて我に返ったように、
「驚いたなあ。僕はあんな計画があるとは思わなかった」
「キスというのは餌だったんだ」
「損害はいくらだい。みんな小遣いしか持ってこなかったから良かったね」
「合計498円……」
「おい、ちょっと待って。僕は金の他にハガキを一枚持って行かれたよ」
「何に？ ハガキ？ ……じゃあ、締めて大枚五枚（500円）ってわけか」（終）

**[Top Story]**
About five mysterious suitors had practically battered down her door, but she’d turned them all away, claiming she’d already made an arrangement.
The last to appear was a slightly portly man of about fifty with a tiny "butterfly" mustache. She found herself immediately taking an immense liking to him. Though he was balding on top, his suit was crisp and clean; he was the perfect image of a "Papa."
The business card he offered read: *Yoshimitsu Kanayama, President and Director, Kanayama Trading Co., Ltd.*
"Just how much would you require for... 'support'?" he asked.
As she explained the dire state of her life as a struggling female painter, Kanayama-san edged closer.
"Eight thousand yen a month would be more than enough," she replied.
"And for that small sum, I get to hold the power of life and death over you, do I?"
"Ho, ho!"
"There’s no need to be ashamed. Everything is a transaction. Now, let’s go somewhere to celebrate our new arrangement—"
She left the hotel with her "innocent" Papa and headed for Shinsaibashi. Wanting to show off his wealth, he promised to buy her a diamond ring as a memento of their meeting.
Afterwards, they went to Kofutei—a place she hadn't been able to afford in ages—where she greedily gorged herself on 3,500 yen's worth of Chinese cuisine.
The Shaoxing wine she drank put her in such a high-spirited mood that she dragged the poor Papa, who was eager to get back to the hotel, all the way to the Florida dance hall to dance the night away.
In the car ride to the hotel afterward:
"Hey, Papa, my head really hurts."
"You'll feel better once you get some sleep," he reassured her.
As soon as they arrived at the hotel, she darted into the dressing room. When she returned, Papa was already grinning, halfway out of his jacket. She wrapped her arms around his neck.
"Tonight, P-a-p-a... I'm on my period."
Promising to see him again in a week, she left the hotel.
For the price of a 300-yen ad and a 200-yen room fee, she walked away with a 15,000-yen ring, a fancy dinner, and a night of dancing. Not a bad haul, wouldn't you say?
She’s already planning her next move.

**[Bottom Story: The Five-Hundred Yen Kiss]**
Yoshiki was taking his usual evening stroll along the riverbank. Suddenly, a figure darted out from the shadow of the rocks right in front of him. Startled, he braced himself.
"Ohoho! There’s no need to be so surprised," the figure said, stepping closer. In the moonlight, she was a beautiful young woman, and Yoshiki couldn't help but let out a sly grin.
It was only natural that the two of them started walking shoulder-to-shoulder. But then, the young woman said something completely unexpected.
"Hey, would you like to buy a ticket?"
"A ticket? For what? A concert?"
"Oh, don't be so boorish. It’s not anything like that. This... is a ticket for the body."
"What? For the...?"
"That's right. Fifty yen a ticket. How about one?"
"But, I mean... where exactly is this ticket valid?"
The woman said nothing, only pointed a finger at her own lips.
Well, the very next night, four of Yoshiki’s low-life friends formed a group and headed to the riverbank. When they arrived, the woman was standing in the shadows of the rocks, puffing on a cigarette.
"Hey, that’s her," one whispered, nudging Yoshiki.
"Yeah, that’s the one."
"Wow, she’s a beauty."
Seeing their chance, one of them tried to bolt ahead of the others.
"Hey, no fair!"
"I'm first!"
A sudden, undignified scramble to be first ensued. Seeing the commotion, the woman suddenly screamed at the top of her lungs:
"They're here!"
The men, who never expected her to make such a scene, were caught completely off guard. While they stood there like idiots, a thundering of footsteps approached, and six or seven suspicious-looking thugs came running.
They were, of course, the local yakuza. A few minutes later, the boys' wallets were bone dry.
"Thank you so much," the woman said as she took the stolen wallets and strolled away with effortless composure.
"Don't take it personally," the thugs shrugged as they turned to leave.
The group stood there in stunned silence for a long time. Finally, one of them snapped out of it.
"I can't believe it. I never suspected a setup..."
"The kiss was just the bait."
"So, what’s the total damage? It’s a good thing we only brought our pocket money."
"Four hundred and ninety-eight yen total..."
"Hey, wait a minute. On top of the cash, they took a postcard I had."
"A postcard? Well... that brings the grand total to exactly five large bills (500 yen), doesn't it?" (End)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is structured as a two-column vertical layout, common in Japanese magazines. There are two distinct narrative pieces.
*   **Typography:** Uses a mixture of larger font for titles and standard body text. It utilizes historical kana orthography (*kyū-kana*) and some older kanji forms (*kyū-jitai*), which was standard until the post-war reforms were fully adopted in the late 1940s.
*   **Illustration:** A simple line drawing ("heta-uma" style) provides a visual summary of the first story's economic "math." It contrasts the small cost (500 yen) with the large reward (15,000 yen ring, dinner, dancing). The text in the illustration acts as a "tldr" or an infographic.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "大枚五枚の唇" is centered in the lower half to separate the two stories. The page number "(47)" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Tone:** The writing is punchy, cynical, and aimed at an adult male audience, likely published in a "Kasutori" (pulp) magazine. These magazines were known for being cheap, sensationalist, and focused on the "three S's": sex, satire, and sensationalism.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** Post-WWII (circa 1946–1952). Japan was under GHQ occupation, suffering from hyperinflation and extreme poverty.
*   **Economic Context:** The prices mentioned (50 yen for a "kiss ticket," 8,000 yen monthly allowance) reflect the shifting value of the yen during hyperinflation. A diamond ring costing 15,000 yen would be an extravagant luxury, while 500 yen was a significant amount for a student or low-wage worker.
*   **"Menses" (メンス):** The use of menstruation as an excuse to avoid sex after receiving gifts was a common trope in stories about "Pan-pan" girls (streetwalkers) and "professional" girlfriends of the era.
*   **Shinsaibashi (心斎橋):** A famous high-end shopping district in Osaka.
*   **Florida (フロリダ):** Likely refers to "Dance Hall Florida," a famous and somewhat decadent establishment in Osaka during the occupation era.
*   **Yotamono (ヨタ者):** A term for street punks, hooligans, or low-level yakuza who hung around entertainment districts to extort money.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **活殺權 (Kassatsuken):** Literally "the power to give life or take it." In this context, it implies total control or ownership over someone.
*   **支那料理 (Shina Ryōri):** An archaic term for Chinese food. "Shina" became a controversial term after the war, eventually replaced by "Chūka."
*   **老酒 (Raochū):** Shaoxing wine, often served in Chinese restaurants.
*   **大枚 (Taimai):** Usually refers to a "large sum" of money. Here, the title "Taimai Gomai" (Five Large Sheets) is a play on words, as the total theft at the end amounts to exactly 500 yen (often represented by five 100-yen notes at the time).
*   **テイツケト (Teitsuketo):** A phonetic rendering of "Ticket."
*   **野暮 (Yabo):** Boorish, unrefined, or lacking in "iki" (urban style).
*   **こすい (Kosui):** Slang for "sneaky" or "cunning."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Scammer" Female:** Both stories feature women using their sexuality or the promise of it to deceive and financially exploit men. This reflects a common post-war male anxiety about the changing roles and perceived "ruthlessness" of women in the struggle for survival.
*   **The "Sugar Daddy" (Papa) Dynamic:** The first story mocks the wealthy man who thinks he can buy a woman's "life and death power," only to be outsmarted by a simple excuse.
*   **Collective Stupidity:** The second story mocks the "herd mentality" of men. Their eagerness to exploit a "cheap" sexual opportunity leads them directly into a trap.
*   **Transactional Morality:** In the post-war ruins, everything—even a kiss or a "patronage" agreement—is explicitly labeled a "transaction" (取引).

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Satire, Pulp Fiction.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Gender War, Scams, Poverty, Eroticism (implied/light), Cynicism, Urban Life.
*   **Era:** Showa 20s (1940s-1950s).
