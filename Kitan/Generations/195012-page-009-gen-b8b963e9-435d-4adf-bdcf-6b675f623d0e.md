## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Top Right Article]**
Pomegranate-mouth and Hair-cutting Stone.
Edo period bathhouse internal structures, compared to today, were quite different; first, at the entrance to the bathtub area, there was no door that opens and closes, and humans were made to bend down to enter and exit, and this was called "Zakuroguchi." 
Pomegranate, since old times being a material for polishing mirrors, vulgarly it is said to be a pun on "The mirror (Kagami) can be polished" [Kagami ga migakeru] and "Bending (Kagami) one can enter."
In "Yanagidaru" verses:
"The pomegranate swallows people and spits them back out."
"Exiting the Zakuroguchi using the child one holds as a lid."
In the bathhouses of that time, there was a monster (?) that can rarely be seen today. It was the "Hair-cutting stone," always rolling in the corner of the rinsing floor. 
Its use was truly wonderful; men and women alike would rub off the excess hair of their private parts, and also snap them off with a click.
"After it grows thick—the feeling of a woman afraid of cutting it with a stone"—from "Yanagidaru."

**[Main Story]**
The Bride who Swallowed and Had Taken Out a Gold Crown.
Yukiko-san was just recently married. Her hair and even her knees/legs were wafting with the scent of a new bride. The internal medicine doctor wondered where on earth this healthy-looking patient was unwell.
"Pregnancy?" "Women's disease?" 
That shouldn't be. If it were such an illness, there's no reason she would have fresh-picked apple-like youthful cheeks.
"Where is it painful?"
"Um, it seems something is inside my stomach..."
"Eh!"
"What, is that all?" the doctor was twice surprised, and at any rate took an X-ray to examine the stomach.
"It is inside."
"What is it?"
"I don't know what it is, but it's a small thing."
With just "small thing" he didn't know, but this kind of thing is extremely easy, so the doctor inserted something like long tweezers from the throat and took it out from the stomach.
"This kind of thing was inside."
"Oh, it's a gold crown."
It was a gold crown for covering a tooth.
"You were wearing a gold crown, weren't you? It became loose from the tooth and you accidentally swallowed it, right?"
"No, Doctor, I don't have a single cavity and I have never had a gold crown."
The doctor there reached a dead end in his thinking. Truly a mysterious story. Then, having sent his wife to the doctor first but being worried, the groom came chasing after.
"Darling, the doctor took this out from my stomach."
"Ah, isn't this my gold crown that has been missing since the other day?"
Thereupon the doctor clapped his hands and said, "No, I understand. Thank you for the 'feast'."
Yukiko-san also realized, and hidden her face, which had suddenly scattered like autumn leaves (blushed), with her sleeve.
"Oh my, oh my, oh my..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**[Top Right Article: Pomegranate Mouths and Pubic Stones]**
The layout of bathhouses in the Edo period was vastly different from those of today. Most notably, the entrance to the bathing area lacked a standard door; instead, bathers had to crouch low to pass through a small opening known as the *zakuroguchi* (pomegranate mouth). Since pomegranate juice was traditionally used to polish bronze mirrors, the name is said to be a pun: "polishing the mirror" (*kagami ga migakeru*) sounds like "the crouching bather can enter" (*kagami ga ikeru*).
As the old *Yanagidaru* verses say:
*"The pomegranate swallows people, then spits them back out."*
*"Exiting the pomegranate mouth, using the babe in her arms as a shield."*
In those days, one would also find a strange object rarely seen in modern baths: the *kegiri-ishi* (hair-cutting stone), usually found discarded in a corner of the washing area. Its purpose was quite remarkable—both men and women used it to grind away or snap off unwanted pubic hair. 
Another verse notes: *"Grown in thick and wild—the trepidation of a woman facing the stone."*

**[Main Story: The Bride and the Golden Crown]**
Yukiko was a blushing bride, still radiating the fresh, sweet scent of a woman newly wed from her hair down to her very toes. Her doctor looked at her, perplexed; she seemed the picture of health.
"Is it pregnancy?" he wondered. "A feminine ailment?" 
No, that couldn't be it. A sick woman wouldn't have cheeks as rosy and fresh as a sun-ripened apple.
"Tell me, where does it hurt?"
"Well... it feels as though something is stuck in my stomach."
"Pardon?"
Startled by the odd complaint, the doctor ordered an X-ray. Sure enough, a shadow appeared. "There is indeed something there," he said. "A small object."
Thinking it a simple matter, the doctor used a pair of long forceps to reach down her throat and retrieve the culprit.
"Here is what was inside you."
"Oh! It’s a gold crown!" Yukiko exclaimed. 
"You must have had a loose dental crown and swallowed it by mistake," the doctor surmised.
"But Doctor," she replied, "I’ve never had a cavity in my life, let alone a gold crown."
The doctor was stumped. It was a complete mystery—until the groom, who had been waiting anxiously outside, burst into the room.
"Look, darling! The doctor found this in my stomach!" Yukiko cried.
The groom’s eyes went wide. "Hey! That’s my gold crown! It’s been missing for days!"
The doctor let out a short laugh and clapped his hands. "Ah, I see. My apologies for... intruding on your 'feast,' so to speak."
Yukiko’s face turned a shade of crimson deeper than autumn leaves as she hid her embarrassment behind her sleeve. "Oh my... oh dear, oh dear!"
—The End—

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The page is a classic example of a mid-century "low-brow" magazine layout. It uses a multi-column format with a mix of informational snippets, sensational fiction, and comic strips.
*   **Typography:** The headers ("Top Kitan," "Irome Sukebei") are hand-lettered in a bold, stylized "Edo-retro" or "showy" font typical of the era's entertainment magazines. The body text is a standard vertical Mincho typeface.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the "Prize-winning Erotic Story" is placed centrally to grab attention, while the "Strange Tale" about bathhouses provides a pseudo-educational veneer at the top.
*   **Illustrations:** The left side features a "Jan-Ken-Pon" (Rock-Paper-Scissors) strip manga by Minoru Yamada. The style is "Heta-uma" (bad-but-good), common in pulp magazines, focusing on physical comedy and mild titillation (strip-janken).
*   **Paper Quality:** The source material appears to be "senka-gami" (low-quality pulp paper), which has aged to a brownish hue, characteristic of *kasutori* magazines named after the cheap, dregs-based shochu of the post-war era.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Kasutori Culture:** The term *kasutori* refers to the three-go (about 540ml) limit of the cheap booze: if you drink three measures, you're "dead" (the magazine usually lasted only three issues before going bankrupt or being censored). This text embodies the *ero-guro-nansensu* (erotic-grotesque-nonsense) tradition that resurfaced after WWII censorship was lifted.
*   **Zakuroguchi (柘榴口):** A historical architectural feature of Edo-era *sento* (public baths). It was a low, dark entrance to the steam area designed to keep the heat in. Because it was dark and cramped, it was a frequent setting for ribald jokes and illicit encounters in Edo literature.
*   **Kegiri-ishi (毛切石):** Literally "hair-cutting stone." Before the widespread use of razors for personal grooming, pumice-like stones were used in bathhouses to abrade or "snap" off pubic hair, a practice associated with both hygiene and aesthetic preference in the Edo period.
*   **The "Gold Crown" Joke:** The story is a typical "rakugo-style" dirty joke. The implication is that the bride accidentally swallowed her husband's dental crown during oral sex. The doctor's comment "Gochisousama" (literally "thank you for the feast," but used idiomatically to comment on a couple's public displays of affection or sexual luck) confirms the double entendre.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Punpun (プンプン):** Usually means "smelling strongly" or "in a huff." Here it describes the "scent" of a new bride, emphasizing her youth and vitality.
*   **Mogitate (もぎたて):** Freshly picked (usually of fruit). Used here to describe the bride's "apple-like" cheeks.
*   **Kinkan (金冠):** Literally "Gold Crown." In a dental context, it refers to a gold cap for a tooth.
*   **Yanagidaru (柳樽):** Refers to *Haifu Yanagidaru*, a famous collection of *senryu* (humorous, satirical poems) from the Edo period. The text cites these to add a "literary" historical context to its erotic trivia.
*   **Irome Sukebei (色目助平):** "Irome" means a suggestive or amorous glance. "Sukebei" is a lecher or pervert. Together, it’s a derogatory but playful term for a "leering lecher."

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Libido:** The text reflects the explosion of sexual interest and "naughty" humor in the wake of wartime austerity. The humor is bawdy but generally harmless, focusing on domestic farces and historical trivia.
*   **The "Innocent" Bride vs. Reality:** The story plays with the trope of the "innocent, fresh" bride who is actually engaged in vigorous sexual activity, a common theme in *kasutori* fiction meant to titillate a male audience.
*   **Modernity vs. Tradition:** The contrast between the Edo-period bathhouse trivia and the "modern" (1950s) medical setting of the gold crown story shows a fascination with how sexual habits have (or haven't) changed over time.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story), Essay (Historical Trivia), Manga, Quiz.
*   **Themes:** Erotica (soft-core), Humor, Edo History, Marriage, Medicine, Wordplay.
