文学にあらわれた女の腹裂き

19

い女はやはり彼の藻をそのままであった。……（中略）…。
　そのうちに藻に似た女が何か囁（ささや）くと、王は他愛なく笑つてうなずいた。家来の唐人はすぐ王の前に召出された。何か命令された家来は、畏（おそ）れこまつて退いたかと思うと、やがて大きい油壺（あぶらつぼ）を重そうに荷（にな）つて来た。千枝松は今まで気がつかなかつたが、この時初めて階段の下の一方に太い銅の柱が立つているのを見つけ出した。大勢の家来が寄つて、その柱にどろどろした油をしたたかに塗り始めると、ほかの家来共は、たくさんの柴を運んで来て、柱の下の大きい穴の底へ山のように積み込んだ。二、三人が松明（たいまつ）のようなものを持つて来て、又その中へ投げ込んだ。ある者は油をそそぎ込んだ。『寒いので焚火をするのか知らぬ』と千枝松は思った。しかし彼の想像はすぐに外れた。
　柴はやがて燃え上つたらしい。地獄の底から紅蓮（ぐれん）の火焔（かえん）を噴くように、真赤な火の塊りが穴一ぱいになつて炎々（えんえん）高（たか）く上ると、その凄じい火の光が銅の柱に映つて、あたりの人々の眉や髭を鬼のように赤く染めた。遠くから覗（のぞ）いている千枝松の頬までが焦げるように熱くなつて来た。火が十分燃えあがるのを見とどけて、藻に似た女は持つている珊瑚（さんご）の扇をたかく挙げると、それを合図に、耳も聾（つんざ）くような銅羅（どら）の音が響いた。千枝松はまたびつくりして振向くと、髭の長い男と白い女が階段の下へ引き出されて来た。彼等は赤裸（はだか）で両手を鉄の鎖につながれていた。
　千枝松は愕然とした。銅羅の音はまた烈しく鳴りひびいて、二人の犠牲（ぎせい）は銅の柱のそばへ押遣られた。千枝松は初めて覚つた。油を塗つた柱に寄りかかつた二人は、忽ちに身体を滑らせて地獄の火坑に転げ落ちるのである。彼ももう堪らなくなつて眼を瞑じようとすると、……』
　これは、岡本綺堂作の『玉藻前』の一節である。藻という女が後の玉藻前であるが、彼女は実は、九千年の齢を重ねた金毛九尾の狐である。
　この狐は最初、印度にあつて斑足太子の皇后、華陽夫人として悪政を施し、次には、殷の紂王の後宮に入り、”妲妃（だっき）”という妖女になつて、悪虐の限りを尽して、雷震に追われて日本に飛来し、玉藻前となつたが、安倍晴明に祈り伏せられて今も尚、上州那須野ケ原の殺生石となつているのである。

　古来、暴君は数限りない。
　紂王は、前記『玉藻前』の記事のような、炮烙（ほうらく）の刑の発明者であり、夏の傑王や、隋の煬帝（ようだい）をしのぎ、中国第一の暴帝と称せられる。しかし、日本にも決してこれに勝るとも劣らぬ暴君が多勢いる。その中でも武烈天皇と、豊臣秀次は、古今の双璧であろう。
　武烈天皇は、一説には僅か十八才で崩御したと言われるがその暴虐ぶりは目に余るものがある。
　人を高い木によじ上らせて、その木を切り倒して殺したり爪を剥いだ手でいもをほじらせたり、川の上流に人を投げ込んで、流れて来るのをほこで刺し殺したりなどした。
　秀次は殺生関白といわれる通り、高野山で僧を殺したり、ご飯に砂が入つていたのを理由にして、料理番の口に砂を押し込み、手足を切つて殺したり、天守閣の上から、道行く人を鉄砲で狙いうちにしたりした。
　これは、淀君のさしがねで、追わされたお万という女にたぶらかされたためとも云い、秀頼に家を譲るため自分から阿呆ばらいをうけるための作り馬鹿であつたとも云われるが、

**Disembowelment of Women as Appeared in Literature**

19

...Before long, the woman resembling Mo (algae/waterweed) whispered something, and the King laughed innocently and nodded. A Chinese retainer was immediately summoned before the King. The retainer, who was ordered something, seemed to withdraw in awe, and soon came carrying a large oil jar heavily. Chiedamatsu had not noticed until now, but at this time he discovered for the first time a thick copper pillar standing on one side at the bottom of the stairs. A crowd of retainers gathered and began to smear thick oil heavily on that pillar; other retainers brought many brushwood branches and piled them up like a mountain at the bottom of the large hole under the pillar. Two or three people brought things like torches and threw them inside again. Someone poured oil in. "I wonder if they are making a bonfire because it is cold," Chiedamatsu thought. However, his imagination was immediately missed.

The brushwood eventually seemed to flare up. Like spouting Crimson Lotus flames from the bottom of hell, bright red lumps of fire filled the hole and rose high in blazes, and that terrifying light of the fire reflected on the copper pillar, dyeing the eyebrows and beards of the people around red like demons. Even the cheeks of Chiedamatsu, who was peeking from afar, became hot as if scorched. Seeing the fire burn sufficiently, the woman resembling Mo raised high the coral fan she held, and at that signal, the sound of a gong that would split the ears echoed. Chiedamatsu, surprised again, turned around, and a long-bearded man and a white woman were dragged out to the bottom of the stairs. They were naked and had both hands connected by iron chains.

Chiedamatsu was struck with horror. The sound of the gong rang out fiercely again, and the two victims were pushed toward the copper pillar. Chiedamatsu realized for the first time. The two people leaning against the oil-smeared pillar would instantly slide their bodies and tumble down into the fire pit of hell. He, also becoming unable to bear it, was about to close his eyes when...

This is a passage from "Tamamo-no-Mae" written by Okamoto Kido. The woman called Mo is the later Tamamo-no-Mae, but she is actually a golden-haired nine-tailed fox who has accumulated nine thousand years of age. This fox first, being in India, carried out misgovernment as Lady Kayō, the consort of Prince Hansoku; next, entering the inner palace of King Zhou of Yin, became the enchantress "Daji," exhausted the limits of cruelty, was chased by Raishin and flew to Japan, becoming Tamamo-no-Mae, but was prayed down by Abe no Seimei and even now remains as the Killing Stone of Nasunogahara in Joshu.

Since ancient times, tyrants are without limit in number. King Zhou was the inventor of the punishment of "Horaku" (The Burning Pillar) as in the aforementioned article of "Tamamo-no-Mae," and surpassing King Jie of Xia or Emperor Yang of Sui, is called the number one tyrant of China. However, in Japan also, there are many tyrants who are never superior nor inferior to this. Among them, Emperor Buretsu and Toyotomi Hidetsugu are the twin peaks of past and present.

Emperor Buretsu is said in one theory to have passed away at only eighteen years of age, but his state of tyranny is more than one can overlook. He made people climb high trees and killed them by cutting down the trees, or made them dig up potatoes with hands from which nails had been peeled, or threw people into the upper reaches of a river and stabbed them to death with spears as they came flowing down.

Hidetsugu, as he is called "The Bloodthirsty Chancellor," killed monks at Mt. Koya, or using the reason that sand was in his rice, pushed sand into the cook's mouth and killed him by cutting off limbs, or sniped at people walking the road from atop the castle tower with a gun. It is said this was because he was deluded by a woman named O-man who was sent by Yodo-dono's design, or it is said it was a feigned madness to receive "Aho-barai" (expulsion for being a fool) himself in order to yield the house to Hideyori, but...

**The Disembowelment of Women in Literature**

Page 19

…In that moment, the woman called Mo leaned in and whispered to the King. He broke into a mindless grin and nodded. A Chinese attendant was summoned at once. Having received his orders, the man withdrew in fearful deference, only to return shortly thereafter lugging a massive, heavy jar of oil. It was then that Chiedamatsu noticed for the first time a thick copper pillar standing to one side at the base of the stairs. A swarm of retainers converged on the pillar, slathering it with a thick, viscous oil. Others hauled in piles of brushwood, stacking them mountain-high in a deep pit beneath the column. Two or three men tossed in torches, while another poured on more oil. "Perhaps they are lighting a fire against the cold," Chiedamatsu wondered. He was quickly proven wrong.

The wood roared to life. Great crimson masses of fire, like the very flames of the Crimson Lotus Hell, filled the pit and surged upward. The terrifying glare reflected off the copper pillar, casting a demonic red glow over the faces and beards of the onlookers. Even Chiedamatsu, watching from his distant vantage point, felt the heat scorching his cheeks. Once the fire had reached a sufficient fury, the woman raised her coral fan high. At this signal, a deafening gong rang out. Startled, Chiedamatsu spun around to see a long-bearded man and a pale-skinned woman being dragged to the foot of the stairs. They were stripped naked, their hands bound in iron chains.

Chiedamatsu gasped in horror. As the gong clattered once more, the two victims were shoved toward the copper pillar. In a flash of terrible realization, he understood: forced against the oil-slicked metal, they would inevitably lose their footing and slide down into the fiery abyss below. Just as he was about to close his eyes, unable to look further…

This passage is excerpted from Okamoto Kido’s *Tamamo-no-Mae*. The woman known as Mo is the titular character, who is in truth a golden nine-tailed fox nearly nine millennia old. Her legend began in India, where she reigned as Lady Kayō, the wicked consort of Prince Hansoku. Later, she infiltrated the court of King Zhou of the Yin Dynasty as the enchantress Daji, committing every conceivable atrocity before being driven out by the immortal Raishin. She eventually fled to Japan and took the name Tamamo-no-Mae, only to be vanquished by the exorcism of Abe no Seimei. To this day, it is said she remains as the "Killing Stone" on the plains of Nasuno.

History has seen countless tyrants. King Zhou, the architect of the "Burning Pillar" torture described above, is widely considered China’s most depraved emperor—surpassing even King Jie of Xia and Emperor Yang of Sui. Yet Japan has produced monsters of equal caliber. Foremost among them are Emperor Buretsu and Toyotomi Hidetsugu.

Emperor Buretsu, who reportedly died at the tender age of eighteen, committed acts of breathtaking cruelty. He would force subjects to climb tall trees only to fell the timber beneath them, or compel them to dig for tubers with hands from which the fingernails had been torn. He was even known to cast victims into the upper reaches of a river so he could spear them like fish as they floated downstream.

Toyotomi Hidetsugu, infamous as the "Bloodthirsty Chancellor," was no less savage. He murdered monks at Mount Koya and, on one occasion, forced sand into his cook’s mouth before dismembering him—all because a few grains were found in his rice. He even took to sniping at random commoners from his castle tower for sport. Some claim he was bewitched by a woman named O-man, an agent of Lady Yodo; others suggest his madness was a calculated ruse to get himself declared unfit for rule, thereby clearing the way for Hideyori to succeed. Regardless of the cause…

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is presented in a traditional Japanese vertical format (*tate-gaki*), common in books and magazines of the mid-20th century.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho style. The page number "19" is placed at the top left, suggesting this is part of a serial feature or a themed anthology.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title is centered at the top. The text is divided into a narrative excerpt (indented and slightly different in tone) followed by an analytical commentary.
*   **Formatting Elements:** 
    *   **Ruby Text (Furigana):** Small kana characters are placed next to kanji (e.g., 囁く/ささや、油壺/あぶらつぼ, 炮烙/ほうらく) to assist with difficult or specific readings.
    *   **Illustration:** A small, sketchy ink drawing at the top shows a person being tortured on a pillar, visually anchoring the text's theme.
    *   **Punctuation:** Uses standard Japanese periods (。) and commas (、), with bracket styles 「 」 for thought/dialogue and 『 』 for book titles.
*   **Structure:** It begins with a dramatic literary excerpt to hook the reader, transitions into a mythological/historical explanation of the character (Tamamo-no-Mae/Daji), and concludes with a catalog of historical "tyrants" to provide real-world context for the theme of cruelty.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** The style suggests the 1950s or early 1960s. During this post-war period in Japan, there was a significant market for "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense) holdovers—publications that delved into the macabre, historical atrocities, and "forbidden" knowledge as a form of pulp entertainment.
*   **Okamoto Kido (1872–1939):** A famous playwright and novelist best known for his *Hanshichi Torimonocho* (detective stories). His retelling of *Tamamo-no-Mae* (1917) modernized the ancient folklore of the nine-tailed fox.
*   **The Nine-Tailed Fox (Kyuubi no Kitsune):** A pan-Asian myth originating in China. The fox is a shapeshifting "femme fatale" who causes the downfall of kingdoms. The text links the Indian, Chinese, and Japanese versions of the legend into a single historical timeline.
*   **King Zhou (紂王):** The last ruler of the Yin (Shang) Dynasty, synonymous in East Asian culture with ultimate depravity. The "Burning Pillar" (*Paoluo/Horaku*) is his most infamous invention, allegedly created at the whim of his concubine Daji.
*   **Emperor Buretsu:** The 25th Emperor of Japan. The *Nihon Shoki* records his extreme cruelty (similar to the tree-felling and nail-pulling mentioned), though many modern historians believe these accounts were fabricated or embellished to justify the dynastic transition to the next lineage (Emperor Keitai).
*   **Toyotomi Hidetsugu:** The nephew of the unifier Toyotomi Hideyoshi. His nickname "Sessho Kanpaku" (Bloodthirsty Chancellor) stems from his erratic and violent behavior, though his tragic end (forced suicide by Hideyoshi) often paints him as a victim of political maneuvering.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **腹裂き (Harasaki/Fukuretsu):** Literally "stomach-splitting" or disembowelment. Though the excerpt focuses on fire, the title suggests a broader theme of gruesome executions.
*   **炮烙 (Horaku):** A specific torture method involving a metal pillar heated by fire, which victims are forced to walk across or climb until they fall.
*   **殺生石 (Sessho-seki):** The "Killing Stone." A famous landmark in Nasu, Tochigi, associated with the spirit of the nine-tailed fox. It is a volcanic rock that naturally emits toxic gases.
*   **紅蓮 (Guren):** "Crimson Lotus." Often refers to the Guren Hell, the seventh of the eight cold hells, where the flesh of the damned is said to crack and turn red like lotus flowers. Here, it describes the color of intense flames.
*   **阿呆払い (Aho-barai):** Literally "expulsion of a fool." A historical term for being disowned or removed from a position due to perceived incompetence or madness.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Femme Fatale" as Catalyst:** The text reinforces the "misogynistic" historical trope that male cruelty is often prompted by the whispers of an enchanting, wicked woman (Daji/Tamamo-no-Mae).
*   **Moral Decay vs. Aesthetic Horror:** The writing style bridges the gap between historical reporting and "horror" fiction. It uses evocative, sensory language ("ears-splitting gong," "scorched cheeks," "demonic red") to engage the reader's morbid curiosity.
*   **Nationalism and Comparison:** There is a rhetorical strategy of comparing Chinese "tyrants" with Japanese ones, suggesting that while China has famous villains, Japan’s own history contains figures equally dark ("twin peaks").
*   **The Supernatural as History:** By blending the historical King Zhou with the mythical Nine-Tailed Fox and the semi-legendary Emperor Buretsu, the text presents a world where the boundary between myth and history is porous.
