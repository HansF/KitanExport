と挨拶した。あれ以来ちっとも姿を見せない熊爺さんだった。ヒサ子も反射的に「お晩です」と低い声で言って、彼の方を見ないように、足早に歩いた。

　今夜は、とってもなく暗い晩で、朝からの曇天で、何となく蒸し暑さを覚えた。雨なのかしら……。
　こんな晩は、夫がしっかりとあたしの腕を抱えてくれた。おかげで山道も大変楽だった。慣れた道とはいえ、こう暗くちゃ、全く困っちまうわ。引っ越して、夫と一緒に出直そうかしら……。いや、せっかくここまで来ちゃったのに、もう駄目だわ。

　彼女は、とある岩角で腰を下ろして、胸を大きくはだけたが、風はなかった。十月も半ばというのに、この蒸し暑さはどうだろう。きっとまた地震かもしれない。……
　彼女は、ふと、近くでゴソリという、岩石を踏み荒らすような音を聞いた。彼女はハッとして、その下手の闇を透かすように見たが、それからは何の反響もなかった。
　彼女は思い直して、襟を入れ、立ち上がると、早くお参りを決行してしまおうと、馬力をかけた。

　もうすぐ石段に辿り着こうと思われる時分、再び後方でザリ〜という人の足音らしいのを耳にした。彼女は恐怖でいっぱいになった。誰だろう？ 今時分山へ登ってくるのは……。とヒサ子は立ち止まって、後方を睨みつけていると、ザリ〜という音も消えた。ヒサ子は、ひょっと、夫の信夫（のぶお）ではないかと思って、「あなたじゃないの？」と呼びかけてみたが、うんともすんとも返事がない。ヒサ子が歩き出すと、後ろの足音もザリ〜と進んでくる。次第にその足音は早くなってきて、今はヒサ子の身近で聞こえた。強い男の足音だ。彼女は、後を振り返るのが恐ろしかった。

　せめて、一刻も早くお社（やしろ）へ入ろうと思った。この場合、無形の天神さんを心の頼りとせねばならぬほど、彼女の気持ちは切羽詰まっていた。一人で来なければよかった！ 夫を待てばよかった、という悔いが、短剣のように彼女の良心を刺した。

　ヒサ子は、石段を駆け上ろうとして、一段踏み違えて思わずのめって、途中で膝をついてしまった。ザリ〜！ と後ろから急に駆け寄る足音がして、一つの黒い影が彼女を抱え起こした。
「奥さん。怪我しねえだか？」
　熊爺だった。彼はヒサ子の上半身をしっかりと抱きしめながら、片手で、挫傷したと思われる彼女の膝頭を撫でる。芋虫のような手触り……。
　ヒサ子は、その手を振り退けると、立ち上がろうとした。
「奥様。無理だよ。俺が連れて行ってやるべえ」
　熊爺はヒサ子をらくらくと抱え上げると、ぶら下げるようにして、石段を上り切った。
「奥様。もう上っただよ。さあお社へ行くべえ」
　ヒサ子は、小さな声で「ありがとう……」と言うほか、なす術がなかった。膝頭はズキンズキンと痛んで、転んだ拍子に強く打ったのが、今だにこたえる。
「奥様。膝が痛むべえか？ お社の中で、俺が撫でてやるべえ」
　熊爺の強い右腕は、ヒサ子の脇の下へ回されて、左手が彼女の胴を持ち、全く抱えられるようにして、社殿に着いた。

　熊爺は草履を脱いで、素足となると、ヒサ子の草履と足袋を脱がし、再び彼女を抱えるようにして、社殿の内部へ入るために、観音開きとなっている格子戸を、トンと足で蹴った。
　反動で扉がギィ……と開く。爺がヒサ子を中へ抱え入れると、後ろで自然と扉の閉まるバタン！ という音がした。

(She) greeted. Since that time at all appearance not showing Kuma-jii-san was. Hisako also reflexively "Good evening" with low voice saying, toward him not looking so as, with fast feet walked.

Tonight, extremely dark night being, since morning cloudy sky by, somehow sultry heat felt. Rain is it maybe...
Such a night, husband firmly my arm held for me. Thanks to that mountain path also very easy was. Familiar path though said, this dark if, completely troubled will be. Move house, with husband together start over shall I... No, with effort this far come having, already no good.

She, at a certain rock corner hips sat, chest greatly opened-to-air, but wind was not. October middle although said, this sultriness how about it. Surely again earthquake maybe.
She, suddenly, nearby "gosori" saying, rock trampling-like sound heard. She "ha!" doing, that lower-part darkness to see through looked, but after that any response was not.
She reconsidered, chest-front put in, standing up, quickly visit-to-shrine execute let's, horsepower applied.

Already soon stone steps reach will-likely time, again behind "zari~" saying person's footstep-like (sound) to ears did. She fear with full became. Who is it? This time mountain to climb coming (person) is... and Hisako stopped, behind glaring was, then "zari~" saying sound also disappeared. Hisako, by chance, husband Nobuo is it not thinking, "Is it you?" calling tried, but "un" nor "sun" response not. Hisako walk starts, behind's footstep also "zari~" proceeded. Gradually that footstep fast became, now Hisako's body near heard. Strong man's footstep is. She, behind to look back fearful was.

At least, one moment earlier Shrine to enter thought. This case, formless Tenjin-san heart's reliance must make extent, her feeling cornered was. Alone if not come good was! Husband if waited good was, saying regret, like short-sword her conscience stabbed.

Hisako, stone steps run up try to, one step misstep-taken unintentionally leaned, middle-way knee struck. Zari~! from behind suddenly rushing-near footstep doing, one black shadow her held-up.
"Ma'am. Injury not do-did?"
Kuma-jii was. He Hisako's upper body firmly hugging-while, with one hand, bruised-thought-to-be her knee-cap strokes. Caterpillar-like touch...
Hisako, that hand shaking-off, stand up tried.
"Ma'am. Impossible is. I take go will-do."
Kuma-jii Hisako easily held-up, hanging-like doing, stone steps climbed-finished.
"Ma'am. Already climbed is. Come, Shrine to let's go."

By recoil door "giii..." opens. Old-man Hisako inside held-in, behind naturally door closing "Batan!" saying sound did.
Hisako that sound by, for the first time...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
She offered a greeting. It was Old Man Kuma, whom she hadn’t seen once since that time. Hisako reflexively muttered a low "Good evening" and hurried past him without looking back.

The night was oppressively dark, and the overcast sky that had persisted since morning brought a stifling, humid heat. *Is it going to rain?* she wondered. On nights like this, her husband used to hold her arm firmly. Thanks to him, even these mountain paths had been easy. Even on a familiar trail, this darkness was enough to make anyone lose heart. *Maybe I should move away and start over with my husband elsewhere... No, after coming all this way, I can't give up now.*

She sat down on the edge of a rock and loosened the front of her kimono to catch a breeze, but there was no wind. It was already mid-October, yet the humidity was unbearable. *Perhaps another earthquake is coming,* she thought. Suddenly, she heard a dry *scuff* nearby—the sound of someone treading on stone. Startled, she peered into the darkness below, but the sound didn't repeat. 

Steeling herself, she adjusted her collar, stood up, and hurried toward the shrine with renewed determination. Just as she was about to reach the stone steps, she heard it again—the unmistakable *crunch* of footsteps behind her. Terror gripped her. *Who would be climbing the mountain at this hour?* She stopped and glared into the shadows, and the sound ceased. Thinking it might be her husband, Nobuo, she called out, "Is that you?" but there was no reply. When she started walking again, the footsteps followed—*crunch, crunch.* They grew faster and closer until they were right behind her. She was too terrified to look back.

She desperately wanted to reach the safety of the shrine. She was so cornered that she found herself praying to the formless Tenjin deity for protection. *I shouldn't have come alone! I should have waited for my husband!* The regret pierced her conscience like a dagger.

As Hisako tried to run up the stone steps, she tripped and fell hard on her knees. *Crunch!* Someone rushed up from behind, and a dark shadow hauled her up. 

"Ma'am, you aren't hurt, are you?" 

It was Old Man Kuma. While holding her upper body firmly, he began to stroke her bruised knee with one hand. His touch felt like a crawling caterpillar. Hisako tried to shake him off and stand up.

"It’s no use, Ma'am. I’ll carry you up."

He hoisted her up effortlessly and carried her the rest of the way up the steps. "We’re at the top now. Come, let’s go into the shrine."

Hisako could do nothing but whisper a faint "Thank you." Her knee throbbed painfully from the impact. "Does it hurt? I'll rub it for you inside the shrine," he said. With his strong right arm under her shoulder and his left hand around her waist, he carried her all the way to the main building.

Kuma-jii kicked off his sandals and, now barefoot, removed Hisako’s sandals and socks. Holding her once more, he kicked open the lattice doors. They swung inward with a heavy creak. As he carried her inside, the doors slammed shut behind them with a loud *thud*. At that sound, for the first time, Hisako...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout**: Typical vertical Japanese text (tategaki). The page contains a mix of narrative text and an illustration.
*   **Typography**: The font is a standard Mincho style typical of mid-century printing. Furigana (reading aids) are used sparingly for certain kanji (e.g., お社/やしろ, 挫傷/ざしよう).
*   **Illustration**: A hand-drawn ink illustration signed "三太郎" (Santaro). It depicts a rugged, bearded man (Kuma-jii) lifting or tending to a woman (Hisako) who appears distressed. The man is dressed in traditional rustic clothing (hanten or yukata-style).
*   **Visual Hierarchy**: The text flows from right to left in columns. The illustration is placed centrally at the bottom, breaking the text columns to emphasize the climax of the scene described on the page.
*   **Pagination**: The number (79) is printed at the bottom center in parentheses, indicating this is a serialized installment in a magazine.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Post-war "Kasutori" Culture**: This text has the hallmarks of *Kasutori* magazines or popular "pulp" fiction from the late 1940s to late 1950s. These stories often featured melodrama, suspense, and a hint of eroticism or "ero-guro" (erotic grotesque) elements.
*   **Tenjin-san**: A reference to the deity of learning and protection, often enshrined in local Shinto shrines.
*   **Gender Dynamics**: The scene highlights the vulnerability of a woman alone at night and the ambiguous nature of the "help" offered by a lower-class or rustic male character. The term "Ma'am" (Okusan/Okusama) indicates Hisako's status as a married woman of likely higher social standing than Kuma-jii.
*   **Dialect**: Kuma-jii speaks with a rural/peasant dialect (e.g., using "~da ka?" and "~bee"), which contrasts with Hisako’s standard, polite internal monologue and speech, emphasizing their class difference.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **熊爺 (Kuma-jii)**: Literally "Old Man Bear." A nickname suggesting a large, hairy, or uncouth older man.
*   **お晩です (Oban-desu)**: A somewhat dated or regional way of saying "Good evening."
*   **馬力をかけた (Bariki o kaketa)**: Literally "applied horsepower." A common idiom of the era meaning to put in extra effort or speed up.
*   **切羽詰まって (Seppa-tsumatte)**: To be backed into a corner or desperate.
*   **芋虫のような手触り (Imomushi no you na tezawari)**: "A caterpillar-like touch." A visceral, creepy simile used to convey Hisako's revulsion at the man's physical contact.
*   **観音開き (Kannon-biraki)**: Double doors that open from the center outwards.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Atmospheric Suspense**: The author uses sensory details (the humid night, the sound of gravel, the darkness) to build a sense of dread.
*   **Class and Power**: The physical dominance of Kuma-jii over the "sophisticated" city-style wife (Okusan) creates a subtext of potential threat or sexual tension common in the *ero-guro* literary tradition.
*   **Ambiguity of Protection**: Is Kuma-jii a savior or a predator? The text balances his helpful actions (carrying her, asking about her injury) with unsettling descriptions (his caterpillar-like touch, kicking the door shut).
*   **Fate and Regret**: Hisako’s internal monologue about her husband and her decision to come alone adds a layer of psychological drama.
