## 2️⃣ Normalized Japanese

のか、どうか知らないが、最近自由主義になってアベックでお乗りになる若いお二人連れが多くなってきた。戦争中だったら、大変なことなんだが、今では、おおっぴらにお乗りになる。バックミラーに映る心配もなく、ゆっくりとお楽しみ出来ると言うわけだ。中には相当濃厚なシーンを展開される組もありますが、ハンドルを握っている身で大体それと分かっても、そこは商売ですから、わざと知らぬ顔をして、ペダルを踏んでゆくのも辛抱ものですよ。

ところが、さて下車ともなれば、相当過分の車代の外に、あてつけ料として
「おじさん、これは少ないけど……」
と、何がしの心付けをポンと気前よく出してくれるので、一時気分は悪くしても、辛抱できるのである。こんな組を十何組何百組も乗せた経験上、考えてみると、女の方から誘って二人乗りの車で喋々喃々（ちょうちょうなんなん）の想を語らうというのが、どうも多いらしい。

昔はハイヤーでドライブと洒落込むのが例であったが、ガソリン不足の昨今では、リンタクに乗って颯爽と言うわけである。
まあそんなわけで、自分の商売の自慢ばかりをするわけではないが、交通難時代の街の愛嬌者として少しは認められているのである。

苦しかった冬も終わりを告げて、さんさんと降り注ぐ陽射しの暖かい春が訪れてくると、若い人がはつらつと街を闊歩する嬉しい時期がくる。
ちょうど昨年の春。もう早いもので満一年になりますね。暑さ寒さも彼岸までという、その彼岸の入りがほんの先へ迫っているといった、ポカポカと暖かい夢心地になる日であった。私は御堂筋の並木の下を空車で走っていた。それは朝、梅田駅から難波駅前の旅館まで、商人らしい中年の男を運んだ帰りだった。

市電道を横切って橋の上に差し掛かった時、十六、七の娘さんに呼び止められた。一人だと思って早速車を止めて「さあどうぞ」と言えば、なんとその女学生らしい娘が、後ろを向いて目配せするじゃないか。驚くじゃないか、これも二十歳になるかならない、頭髪をテカテカに光らせた青年が、「うん」とうなずいて、魔物に乗ってきたのだから。

「どこへ参りましょう」
「あんた、住吉？ どこ？」
娘は男にぴったりと寄り添ってそう聞いている。私等の若い時代のことを思えば変わったなあと考えさせられる。
「住吉公園の近くに、知った家があるのだなあ、と」
「それじゃ、住吉へ行くんですかい」

私には、よいお客さんを案内する、とっておきの珍しい「巣」があるから、大阪からよくお客を乗せて十六号線を走ってゆくことがある。
「じゃ、とにかく住吉まで行って」
あくまで女の方が能動的である。私はハンドルを握るとクルリと反転して難波駅の方へ向かった。そこから右へそれて、ずっと平々坦々なアスファルトの国道である。

二人乗せたって、よい道で弾みがつきさえすれば、後は楽なもの。春風を切って私の車は相当のスピードを出して走った。
別に聞こうとするわけではないが、二人の話しが自然と耳に入ってくる。彼女は尼崎市塚口で照子と言う十七になる女学生らしい。話を総合してみると、某高女の卒業をあと一年に控えながら、華々しい宝塚の舞姫に憧れて、親の意見も耳に入らずに、同高女を中途退学し、同月の初め宝塚の試験を受けたが、抱いていた宝塚ガールの乙女の夢も無残に破れ去った。

見たところ、なかなか整った顔立ちだが、背の低いのが難点かもしれない。女学校へも帰れなくなった彼女は、毎日母親から聞かされる叱責に耐えかねて、ついに家出をした。そして女学校時代の不良仲間と語らって、家の衣類や時計などを持ち出して大阪へ来ると、毎日盛り場をうろうろして遊んでいた。

しかしそんなことは長く続くわけのものではないので、仕方なく、心斎橋や新世界で映画を見ては、隣に座っている青年を誘惑して旅館へ引っ張り込み、生活費を捻出する女に転落して行った。
実は映画、夜は旅館という享楽の生活は、虚栄心に富んだ彼女にとっては、もってこいの商売であるかもしれないが、ほんの少し前までは制服の処女であった彼女が、そういう種類の女になると言うことは、空恐ろしい気がする。

住吉公園の森が見えてきた。私のたくましく駆け巡っていた空しい想念もフッと書き消されて、後ろの二人へ振り返った。やはり商売が大切である。
「住吉へ来ましたよ、これからどこへ行きましょう？」
「さあ、どっちへ行ってもらおう」
「私、こちらは少しも知らないのよ」

公園の入口で車を止めて、私はちょっと足を休めた。トラックが走り過ぎるたびに砂ぼこりが巻き上がって、それがこちらへ被さってくる。
「それじゃ、私の懇意な家へ案内しましょうか」
車を引いて左へ折れた。そこは優雅で閑静な、広告通りの家である。私は二人をそこの離れへ紹介すると、車を返して北へ国道を走り出した。もちろん、彼女からは、だんまりと車賃の外に、心付けを貰ったのは勿論である。世は正に春だ。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Whether [due to that] or not, I don't know, but recently having become [under] liberalism, young couples ("abecs") riding together have become many. If it were during the war, it would have been a terrible thing, but now, they ride in the open. Without worrying about being reflected in the rearview mirror, they can enjoy themselves slowly—that is the situation. Among them, there are pairs who develop quite intense scenes, but for one holding the handlebars, even if I generally realize it, because it is business, I purposely make a face like I don't know, and treading the pedals is a thing of patience.

However, when it comes to getting off, in addition to a quite excessive fare, as a "watching fee":
"Uncle, this is a little, but..."
They give a tip of some amount with a "pon" [sound] generously, so even if the mood was temporarily bad, I can endure it. Based on the experience of carrying ten-some or hundreds of such pairs, thinking about it, it seems that there are many cases where the woman invites [the man] and they talk of flirtatious thoughts in a two-seater vehicle.

In the old days, making a stylish habit of driving in a hired car was the example, but in these days of gasoline bottoming out, one rides a "rintaku" (bicycle taxi) and goes briskly. Well, for that reason, I am not just praising my own business, but as the "charmers" of the streets in an era of transportation difficulty, we are recognized a little.

The painful winter has announced its end, and when the warm spring with sunbeams pouring down "san-san" visits, the happy time when young people walk briskly through the streets comes. Just last year's spring. It has already been one full year, hasn't it. It was a day of feeling like a warm "poka-poka" dream, where the beginning of the equinox (higan)—as they say "heat and cold until the equinox"—was just ahead. I was running empty under the trees of Midosuji. It was the return trip from carrying a middle-aged man who looked like a merchant from Umeda Station to a ryokan in front of Namba Station.

When I crossed the tram tracks and reached the top of a bridge, I was hailed by a girl of sixteen or seventeen. Thinking it was one person, I quickly stopped the vehicle and said, "Come in, please." To my surprise, that girl, who looked like a female student, looked back and winked! To my shock, a young man, barely twenty, with his hair shining grease-ily, nodded "un" and climbed onto the "demon's vehicle" (the pedicab).

"Where shall we go?"
"You, Sumiyoshi? Where?"
The girl snuggled closely to the man and asked that. Thinking of the time of our youth, I was made to think, "Things have changed."
"Near Sumiyoshi Park, there is a house I know..."
"Well then, are you going to Sumiyoshi?"

For the author [me], because I have a "special nest" to guide good customers to, I sometimes take customers from Osaka and run along Route 16.
"Then, anyway, go to Sumiyoshi."
To the end, the woman is the active one. I gripped the handlebars, spun around, and headed toward Namba Station. From there, veering right, it is a perfectly flat asphalt national highway.

Even carrying two people, if it's a good road and I get momentum, the rest is easy. Cutting through the spring breeze, my vehicle ran at a considerable speed. Not that I was trying to listen, but the conversation of the two naturally entered my ears. She seems to be a 17-year-old student named Teruko from Tsukaguchi, Amagasaki. Synthesizing the talk, while having one year left until graduation from a certain girls' high school, she longed for the flashy dancing girls of Takarazuka, did not listen to her parents' opinions, dropped out of the high school, and at the beginning of the same month took the Takarazuka exam, but the maiden's dream of being a Takarazuka Girl that she held was cruelly broken.

Looking at her, she has a face that can "step" [is attractive], but being short might be a drawback. Having become unable to return to the girls' school, unable to bear the rebukes heard from her mother every day, she finally ran away from home. And talking with bad friends from her school days, she took clothes and watches from home and came to Osaka, and every day she loitered and played in the entertainment districts.

However, such things cannot last long, so having no choice, after watching movies at Shinsaibashi or Shinsekai, she would seduce the young man sitting nearby, pull him into a ryokan, and fell into being a woman who twists out living expenses. Actually, a life of pleasure—movies and ryokan at night—for her, who is full of vanity, might be a perfect business, but the thought that she, who was a virgin in uniform until just a little while ago, would become that kind of woman makes me feel a bit frightened.

The woods of Sumiyoshi Park came into view. My vain thoughts that had been running around were suddenly wiped away, and I looked back at the two. After all, business is important.
"We've arrived at Sumiyoshi. Where shall we go from here?"
"Well, where should we have you go?"
"I don't know this area at all."

Stopping the vehicle at the entrance to the park, I rested my legs a bit. Every time a truck passed, dust swirled up and covered us.
"Then, shall I guide you to a house I'm familiar with?"
Pulling the vehicle, I turned left. It is a house on a street as quiet and elegant as an advertisement. After I introduced the two to the detached room there, I turned the vehicle and started running north on the highway. Of course, from her, besides the fare, I received a tip in silence. The world is truly spring.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Whether it’s the new spirit of liberalism or something else, I don’t know, but lately, I’ve seen more and more young couples—"abecs," as they call them—riding together. Back during the war, such a thing would have caused an uproar, but nowadays, they do it quite openly. With no rearview mirror to worry about, they can relax and enjoy each other's company. Some pairs get quite carried away with rather "intense" scenes right there in the back. Even if I can tell what’s going on while I’m at the handlebars, business is business. I just keep my eyes forward and focus on the pedals—it’s a real test of patience, I tell you.

However, once they go to get out, they often hand over a generous tip on top of the fare, calling it a little "extra" for my trouble. "Here, uncle, it’s not much, but..." they’ll say, handing it over with a flourish. That’s enough to make even the most awkward ride bearable. In my experience carrying hundreds of these couples, it seems it’s usually the woman who takes the lead, inviting the man into the pedicab for a bit of whispered sweet nothings.

In the old days, a stylish date meant a drive in a hired car, but with gasoline as scarce as it is lately, a brisk ride in a *rintaku* pedicab is the height of fashion. I'm not just tooting my own horn, but in these times of transport shortages, we’ve become something of the "charming fixtures" of the city streets.

As the harsh winter fades and the warm spring sun begins to pour down, the city comes alive with spirited young people. It was just about this time last year—time certainly flies. It was one of those dreamy, balmy days when you feel the truth of the saying "no heat or cold lasts beyond the equinox." I was cruising along Midosuji under the budding trees, heading back empty-headed after dropping off a middle-aged merchant at a Shinsaibashi inn.

As I crossed the tram tracks over a bridge, a girl of sixteen or seventeen hailed me. Thinking she was alone, I pulled over. "Hop in," I said. To my amazement, she looked back and gave a quick wink! Before I knew it, a young man in his early twenties, his hair slicked back with grease, gave a sharp nod and hopped into my "beast of burden" right behind her.

"Where to?" I asked.
"Hey, do you know Sumiyoshi?" the girl asked, snuggling up tight against the man. Looking at them, I couldn't help but think how much times had changed since I was young.
"I know a place near Sumiyoshi Park," the man muttered.
"Sumiyoshi it is, then?" I confirmed.

I have a few "special spots" I like to recommend to good customers, so I often find myself taking people out of the city toward Route 16. 
"Just take us to Sumiyoshi for now," she said. It was definitely the woman calling the shots. I spun the handlebars and headed toward Namba, then veered right onto the flat asphalt of the national highway.

With two passengers, as long as the road is good and you get some momentum, the work is easy. My pedicab flew through the spring air. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but their conversation drifted right into my ears. Her name was Teruko, a seventeen-year-old student from Tsukaguchi in Amagasaki. Putting the pieces together, it seemed she had been a year away from graduating a girls' high school when she became obsessed with the glamorous dancers of the Takarazuka Revue. Ignoring her parents, she dropped out to take the entrance exam, but her dream of becoming a "Takarazuka Girl" was cruelly crushed.

She was pretty enough, but perhaps her height had been the issue. Unable to face her school or the daily scolding from her mother, she finally ran away. She met up with some "delinquent" friends from her school days, stole some clothes and watches from home, and had been drifting through the Osaka entertainment districts ever since.

But a life of drifting can't last forever. Eventually, she fell into a pattern: she’d go to the movies in Shinsaibashi or Shinsekai, seduce the young man sitting next to her, and lead him to an inn to squeeze out enough money to live on. A life of movies by day and inns by night might suit her vanity, but the thought that she had been a schoolgirl in a uniform just a short while ago was enough to send a chill down my spine.

The woods of Sumiyoshi Park came into view, snapping me out of my grim reflections. Business first, after all.
"We’re at Sumiyoshi. Where to now?"
"Hmm, I'm not sure," the man said.
"I don't know this area at all!" Teruko chirped.

I stopped at the park entrance to give my legs a rest. Every time a truck roared past, a cloud of dust washed over us.
"Shall I take you to a quiet place I know?" I suggested.
I turned left and pulled the vehicle down a peaceful, elegant street. I dropped them off at a private annex and headed back north toward the highway. She gave me a silent tip on top of the fare, of course. Spring was well and truly in the air.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is formatted in a traditional Japanese magazine style: vertical orientation, read from right to left. It is divided into three distinct columns.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-20th-century printing. The use of small furigana or repeating characters (like the "く" shape for repetition in "テカ／＼" or "うろ／＼") is characteristic of the era.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text is dense and uniform, suggesting a narrative essay or short story meant for continuous reading rather than a news report. The page number "16" is centered at the bottom.
*   **Column Structure:** The columns are roughly equal in width. Paragraphs are indicated by a one-character indentation.
*   **Period Features:** The text uses some older orthography, such as "ゐ" (wi) and "ゑ" (we) being absent, but it uses the small "ッ" inconsistently and older kanji forms (like "大變" for "大変").

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Era (Late 1940s - Early 1950s):** The text mentions "post-war liberalism" (*jiyu-shugi*) vs. wartime restrictions, gasoline shortages (*gasorin busoku*), and the popularity of the *rintaku* (pedicab). This points to the immediate post-WWII period in Japan (Occupation Era).
*   **Rintaku (リンタク):** A portmanteau of "bicycle" (*rin*) and "taxi." These bicycle-pulled carriages were a primary mode of transport in bombed-out Japanese cities like Osaka when gasoline was rationed and cars were scarce.
*   **Abec (アベック):** A loanword from the French *avec* (with), used in 20th-century Japan to refer to a romantic couple. It carried a slightly scandalous or modern connotation in the post-war years.
*   **Takarazuka Girl (寶塚ガール):** Refers to the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female theater troupe. Becoming a "Zukannu" (Takarazuka performer) was a dream for many young girls, representing ultimate glamour and success.
*   **Osaka Geography:** The driver mentions Midosuji (the main north-south boulevard), Umeda and Namba (the two main transit hubs), Shinsaibashi (fashion district), and Shinsekai (an entertainment district). This grounds the story in the specific gritty, bustling reality of post-war Osaka.
*   **Pan-pan Girls/Streetwalkers:** While not explicitly labeled, the description of "Teruko" seducing men in cinemas to go to inns describes a common social phenomenon of the post-war era where young women, often displaced or desperate, turned to sex work to survive.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **喋々喃々 (Chōchō-nannan):** An idiom describing lovers whispering sweet nothings or flirting.
*   **心付 (Kokorozuke):** A tip or gratuity.
*   **ハイヤー (Haiyā):** A "hire" car (a chauffeured taxi), considered more upscale than a standard taxi or pedicab.
*   **昨今 (Sakkon):** Nowadays; recently.
*   **颯爽 (Sassō):** Briskly; gallantly; with a dashing air.
*   **高女 (Kōjo):** Abbreviation for *Kōtō Jogakkō* (Girls' High School), the secondary education system for women before the 1947 educational reforms.
*   **虚榮心 (Kyoeishin):** Vanity; vainglory.
*   **離れ (Hanare):** A detached room or cottage, often used in inns or traditional houses for privacy—implying the driver is taking them to a "short-stay" establishment.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Social Decay vs. Liberation:** The narrator views the new "liberalism" with a mix of amusement and cynicism. While he enjoys the tips, he is unsettled by the "intense scenes" and the fall of a former schoolgirl into prostitution.
*   **The Gender Shift:** The narrator repeatedly notes that the woman is the "active" one (*nōdō-teki*). This reflects a post-war anxiety about changing gender roles and the perceived boldness of the "new woman" (often linked to the "Pan-pan" girl archetype).
*   **Economic Desperation:** Beneath the "dreamy spring" prose lies a dark reality of poverty. Teruko’s "fall" is prompted by her failed dreams of glamour (Takarazuka) and the need to "twist out" living expenses.
*   **The Voyeuristic Narrator:** The driver serves as a silent witness to the city's secrets. He is part of the "service" of the night, providing not just transport but "nests" for illicit encounters, highlighting the gray-market economy of the time.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Narrative Essay, Social Commentary, Fiction (Short Story).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Osaka, Urban Life, Prostitution, Youth Culture, Gender Roles, Poverty, Transport.
*   **Classification:** Mature (contains references to sex work/illicit behavior).
