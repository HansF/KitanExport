さんが電話を聞いたので知つているのである。――とすると？

　晴子は遂に難關にぶつかつた。この奇怪な幽靈犯人は誰だろう。彼女は美しい唇をキリツと結んで、もう一度最初から推理を組み直してみるのだった。

　　（三）

　晴子はもう一度惨劇の室へ歸ると美代子の死体を綿密に再檢査してみた。もう下顎などに硬直が始まり出している點からして、死後經過時間約一時間、兇行は十一時分頃に相違ない。

　次に兇器は何だろう。晴子は乳房の下の傷口を入念に調べたが、何か箸のようなもので刺したらしい。美代子の室を探してみたが、どうも該当する兇器らしいものは見當らない。

　犯行の位置は？ 美代子が寝ている所へ犯人が入つて来きて、アッと言つて立上ろうとした所をズブッと刺しそのまま彼女は昏倒してしまったものだ。その時に血が飛んだらしく、犯人も多少は血を浴びていなければならない筈である。

　最も濃厚な嫌疑者山野三夫は、どこ迄も犯行を否定するし、又動機的にも戀人を刺殺せねばならない理由は何所にもない。それにこの男、人が殺せる程甲斐性のある人間でもないらしい。

　晴子は月光を仰ぎ乍らぢつと考えいていたが突然何に思い當つたのだろう。シュークリームみたいな頬にペコッと深い笑靨を刻むと、

〃分ったわ！〃

と明るく叫んでいた。

〃あの傷口に附着していたのは灰だ。火鉢の灰だったんだわ！〃

　獨り呟くと管理室へ飛込んで、警察へ殺人事件を告げる電話を掛けていた。そして、彼女は野々村君の室へ引返すと、

〃何度も起してすみませんけれど瀧子さんすぐ着物を着て外出の用意をなさつて下さいな〃

と言つた。まさか丑の刻詣りに行くのでもなかろうが、この深夜に一休箇所へ行くのだろうと、三平君の方が驚いたらしい顔付きだつた。

〃早くなさらないと、もう十分程もしたらお迎えの人が到着しますから〃

〃え！ 一体何所へ行きますの？〃

〃警察。それから後は貴女の胸に尋ねてごらんなさい〃

高壓線に触れた雀のように、瀧子はビクンと跳上つていたし、三平君は寝衣のまゝ、飛出してうろうろしていた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation
...because [someone] heard the telephone, [they] know. --If so?

Haruko finally hit a difficult barrier. This strange ghost-criminal, who could it be? She pursed her beautiful lips tightly and tried to reconstruct the reasoning once more from the beginning.

(3)

When Haruko returned once more to the room of tragedy, she tried a close re-examination of Miyoko's corpse. From the point that rigor mortis was already starting to begin in the lower jaw and such, the time elapsed after death being about one hour, the foul deed must be around 11 o'clock without mistake.

Next, what is the murder weapon? Haruko carefully investigated the wound below the breast, but it seems [someone] stabbed with something like a chopstick. She tried searching Miyoko's room, but a thing that seems like a corresponding murder weapon is nowhere to be found.

What is the position of the crime? The criminal entered the place where Miyoko was sleeping, and just as she said "Ah!" and tried to stand up, [they] stabbed with a "zubu" sound, and she just like that fell unconscious. At that time, it seems blood flew, and the criminal also must have been bathed in at least some blood.

The most thick-with-suspicion suspect, Yamano Mitsuo, denies the crime to the end, and also motivation-wise, a reason why he must stab-kill his lover is nowhere. Besides, this man does not seem to be a person with enough resourcefulness/manliness to be able to kill a person.

Haruko, while looking up at the moonlight, was thinking intently, but suddenly she must have realized something. When she carved a "peko" deep dimple into her cream-puff-like cheeks,

"I've got it!"

she was shouting brightly.

"That which was adhering to the wound is ash. It was the ash of the hibachi!"

Muttering to herself, she flew into the manager's office and was making a phone call to the police to report the murder case. And, when she returned to Mr. Nonomura's room,

"I am sorry for waking you many times, but Takiko-san, please put on your kimono immediately and make preparations for going out."

she said. It couldn't be that they were going for an 'Ushi-no-koku-mairi' (ox-hour curse visit), but at this late hour where on earth were they going, Sanpei-kun's face had an astonished look.

"If you don't do it quickly, in about ten minutes the person coming to pick you up will arrive."

"Eh! Exactly where are we going?"

"The police. After that, try asking your own heart."

Like a sparrow that touched a high-voltage wire, Takiko jumped with a "bikun," and Sanpei-kun, in his nightclothes, flew out and was wandering aimlessly.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation
...he knew because he’d overheard the telephone call. If that was the case, then...?

Haruko had finally hit a wall. Who was this bizarre, phantom killer? Pursing her lovely lips firmly, she began to reconstruct her deductions from the very beginning.

(III)

Returning once more to the scene of the tragedy, Haruko performed a meticulous re-examination of Miyoko’s body. Since rigor mortis was already beginning to set in around the jaw, it was certain the crime had taken place about an hour ago, around eleven o’clock.

Next: the murder weapon. Haruko carefully inspected the wound beneath the breast; it appeared she had been stabbed with something resembling a chopstick. She searched Miyoko’s room, but nothing resembling such a weapon was to be found.

And the logistics of the crime? The killer must have entered while Miyoko was asleep; as she cried out and tried to bolt upright, they drove the weapon home. She would have lost consciousness instantly. Blood must have sprayed then; the killer could not have escaped being stained by it.

The prime suspect, Mitsuo Yamano, maintained a steadfast denial, and truthfully, he had no motive whatsoever to murder his own lover. Besides, the man didn't seem to have the stomach for cold-blooded killing.

Haruko gazed up at the moonlight, lost in thought, when the truth suddenly struck her. A deep dimple flashed in her cream-puff-soft cheeks as she smiled.

“I’ve got it!” she cried out triumphantly.

“The substance stuck to the wound—it’s ash! It was ash from the *hibachi*!”

Muttering the realization to herself, she dashed into the manager’s office to report the murder to the police. Returning to Nonomura’s room, she spoke:

“I’m sorry to keep waking you, but Takiko-san, please put on your kimono and get ready to leave at once.”

Sanpei looked on, bewildered. It wasn't as if they were heading out for some midnight curse ritual, but he couldn't imagine where they would be going at this hour.

“Hurry, now. Our ‘escort’ will be here in ten minutes.”

“Wh—what? Where are we going?”

“To the police station. As for why... well, you can ask your own conscience.”

Like a sparrow hitting a live wire, Takiko recoiled with a visible shudder. Sanpei, still in his nightclothes, rushed out of the room and paced the hallway in a panicked daze.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
*   **Layout:** The page features a classic mid-century Japanese magazine layout. The text is arranged in vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), wrapping around a large central illustration.
*   **Illustration:** The artwork depicts a woman in a state of repose or perhaps a stylized crime scene pose. The style is "Showa Modern," characterized by elegant, flowing lines and a slight Art Deco influence. The woman wears a patterned kimono, and the floral motifs (large chrysanthemums or similar flowers) are prominent.
*   **Typography:** The text uses a mix of Kanji and Hiragana, with Katakana used for emphasis or onomatopoeia (e.g., キリツ, ズブッ, ペコッ). The use of the iteration mark "〃" for quotation marks is a common feature of older Japanese printing. 
*   **Sectioning:** The Roman numeral "(三)" indicates this is the third section or chapter of the story.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustration dominates the page, drawing the eye first, followed by the text which provides the narrative context for the visual.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era (Late 1940s/Early 1950s):** The orthography (using large 'tsu' つ for small 'tsu' っ and older kanji forms like 歸 for 帰) suggests the early post-war period. This was the golden age of "Suiri" (detective/mystery) fiction in Japan, led by authors like Edogawa Ranpo.
*   **Ushi-no-koku-mairi (丑の刻詣り):** A traditional ritual of cursing someone by nailing a straw doll to a tree at a shrine during the "hour of the ox" (2:00 AM – 4:00 AM). The text mentions this to highlight the eerie, late-night nature of the departure.
*   **Hibachi (火鉢):** A traditional Japanese charcoal brazier used for heating. In this story, the ash from the hibachi serves as the "smoking gun" clue.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** Haruko is a "female detective" figure, a popular trope in post-war fiction representing the "new woman"—intelligent, observant, and independent.
*   **Kimono:** While Western clothing was becoming more common, the characters are still depicted wearing kimonos, reflecting the transition period in Japanese fashion.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **難關 (Nankan):** A barrier, obstacle, or deadlock in an investigation.
*   **兇行 (Kyōkō):** A brutal act or a crime (murder).
*   **甲斐性 (Kaishō):** Resourcefulness, gumption, or the ability to get things done (often used to judge a man's worth in old-fashioned terms).
*   **笑靨 (Ekubo):** An older kanji for "dimple" (modern: えくぼ).
*   **昏倒 (Kontō):** To fall unconscious; to faint.
*   **ズブッと (Zubutto):** Onomatopoeia for a sharp object entering flesh deeply.
*   **ビクンと (Bikunto):** Onomatopoeia for a sudden, sharp jerk or twitch.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Deduction and Logic:** The text emphasizes the "Suiri" (reasoning) aspect. Haruko is not just looking at the body but calculating time of death and analyzing physical evidence (ash).
*   **The "Impossible" Crime:** The mention of a "ghost criminal" (幽靈犯人) suggests a locked-room mystery or a crime that seems supernatural until explained by logic.
*   **Class and Character:** The description of Yamano Mitsuo as lacking *kaishō* (gumption) reflects social judgments of the time—the idea that a "weak" man couldn't commit a "strong" crime.
*   **Noir Atmosphere:** The mention of moonlight, midnight, and the sudden shock (like a sparrow hitting a wire) creates a tense, suspenseful atmosphere typical of pulp detective novels.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Mystery, Detective Story.
*   **Genre:** Suiri (推理), Noir, Pulp.
*   **Themes:** Murder investigation, forensic clues, female detective, 1950s Japan.
*   **Flags:** Stylized violence (description of a stabbing), suspense.
