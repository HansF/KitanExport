あばずれ女の
**戀愛戰術**

かすりこり戰法　富田信二

**映画館の女**

夏休みには是非歸つて来いといふ親からの手紙をろくろく讀みもしないで、學資の外に五千圓送つてほしいといふてやつたら、親といふものは甘いもので、ッユ疑うこともせず、そんなに多く本を買うのはいいけれど、勉強し過ぎて病気になるなよと、ポンといつたけの金を入れてよこした。

私は、ほくそ笑みながら市電に乗つて、先づ京極の映画館で時間をつぶしそれから、目的とする所へシケ込もうと思つて、三條河原町で降りた。
××座の特等席へ案内されたが、丁度映写中だつたので、明るい外から入つてきた私は足元はつきりみえなかつたから、案内女に手をひかれて、やつと席に就いた。

途中からで何が何やらさつぱり分らぬ映画を観ている中に、ぱつと明るくなつた。今まで映画にひきつけられていた観客が俄に喋り出したので、ガヤ〜わけの分らぬ雑音が鼓膜を刺戟した。から、私は、今更のようにあたりを見廻した。

そのとき、十八九の綺麗な娘が特等席へ入つてきたが、座席がないので、立つたまま割込めそうな所を探している様子だつた。

私は、自分の隣へ席をこしらえてやろうと思つて、いつも本を包んだ風呂敷包みを置いておいたが、これ幸いとそれを取り上げ、チラツと女を眺めやつた。
相手があんまり美しい女だつたので何んとなくきまりが悪いので、露骨に合圖らしい仕草はしなかつたが、女は、私の素振りを早くもみてとり、「ごめんください」
つかつかとこちらへやつてきた。

優しい声をかけながら、私の隣へかけた。ちょうど、その時はベルが鳴つていて、女がかけた拍子に電燈が消えたので、女は面くらつて、何かにまづいたのか、ふら〜と倒れそうになつて、私の膝の上へ手を突いた。
「あら、ごめんなさい」
女は媚びるような眼つきを私の顔に投げた。映画の場面が現れたが、女が隣へ座つてからの私は、もうそれどころでなかつた。
ふうんと甘つたるい香水の匂いがするし、時々、扇子で、こちらへ風を送つてくれるし、膝の上へ手を突いた時の柔い感触が脳髄に泌みこんで離れないし、でも、角帽のてまえ、ムヤミに手を握りに行くわけにいかないので、溜息ばかりついていた。

すると、どうだろう、私の肘に、女の肘がぴつたりくつついてきたのだ。横腹でによらんでみると、わざわざ躰を傾けて、私の方へ寄添つているのである。

私は、唯事でないと思つた。
みかけたところ、良家のお嬢さんみたいに上品だが――フフン、アブレイベルの生態はこんなものかもしれないよし、その気なら――。
私は、そう思うと、身内がぞく〜するほど嬉しくなつて、自分からも、躰で女をグツと押してみた。
すると、女もまたそれに応えるのかグツと押し返してきた。

こうなると私も、それだけでは満足できなくなつて、何とかもつと具体的な意志表示がないかと、その方法を考えていると、女の手が、自分の膝の方へきたような気がするので、その方へ手をやると、果して女の手があつた。むつちりした、温い手に触つてみた。

女の手はじつとしている。
今度は、その手の上へ自分の手をのせてみたが、それでもじつとしているので、思いきつて、じんわり握つてやると、女もまた、ぎゆつと握りかえした。
私は、もう、たまらなくなつたので――。

Summer vacation-at "By all means return please" called parents-from letter carefully read-without, tuition-besides 5,000 yen send want-to said-and-gave-then, parents called things sweet-things-are-indeed, a bit doubt doing-without, "That many much books buying-is good-but, study overdoing-and sick become-don't-yo" as, pop! that much money put-in sent.

**The Shameless Woman’s Tactics of Love**
*The "Rubbing" Strategy by Shinji Tomita*

**The Woman in the Movie Theater**

Without so much as a proper glance at the letter from my parents pleading with me to come home for summer vacation, I wrote back asking for five thousand yen on top of my tuition. Parents are soft touches; they didn't suspect a thing. "It’s all well and good to buy so many books," they wrote, "but don't study so hard that you make yourself sick," and they promptly sent over the cash.

Smirking to myself, I hopped on a city tram. I figured I’d kill some time at a theater in the Kyogoku district before heading off to my real destination, so I got off at Sanjo Kawaramachi. I was ushered into the premium seating at the XX-Theater, but since the film was already playing, I was blinded by the sudden transition from the bright outdoors. I couldn't see a step in front of me, so the usherette had to take my hand and lead me to my seat.

I was watching a movie that I couldn't make heads or tails of, having missed the beginning, when the lights suddenly flared up. The audience, who had been spellbound until a moment ago, erupted into chatter, the sudden cacophony of voices grating against my eardrums. I took the opportunity to look around at my surroundings.

Just then, a beautiful girl of eighteen or nineteen entered the premium section. Finding no empty seats, she seemed to be scanning the rows for a spot where she might squeeze in.

Thinking I’d make a space for her next to me, I picked up the *furoshiki* bundle of books I usually kept on the neighboring seat. I stole a quick glance at her. She was so stunning that I felt a bit bashful, so I didn't make any overt signals, but she was quick to catch my drift. "Excuse me," she said, stepping briskly toward me.

With a gentle voice, she took the seat beside me. Just at that moment, the signal bell rang and the lights cut out. Caught off guard by the sudden darkness or perhaps tripping on something as she sat, she stumbled and thrust her hand onto my knee to steady herself.
"Oh! I'm so sorry," she whispered.
She cast a flirtatious look my way. A new scene appeared on the screen, but from the moment she sat down, the movie was the last thing on my mind.
The air was thick with the cloyingly sweet scent of her perfume. Every so often, she would flutter her fan, sending a breeze my way. The soft sensation of her hand on my knee had seared itself into my brain and wouldn't leave. Yet, mindful of the "square cap" I wore—the mark of a serious student—I couldn't very well just reach out and grab her hand. I could do nothing but sit there and sigh.

Then, to my surprise, her elbow pressed firmly against mine. Stealing a glance, I saw she was purposely leaning her body toward me, huddling close.

*This is no ordinary encounter,* I thought.
She looked as elegant as a daughter from a respectable family, but—heh—perhaps this is just how these "shameless" types operate. *Well then, if that's how she wants it...*
The thought sent a thrill through my entire body. I leaned in and gave her a firm nudge with my torso. In response, she pushed back just as firmly.

I wasn't about to stop there. I was racking my brain for a more concrete way to show my intent when I felt her hand move toward my knee. I reached out, and sure enough, my hand met hers. It was plump and warm to the touch.

She didn't pull away.
I placed my hand over hers. She remained still. Emboldened, I gave her hand a slow, firm squeeze. She squeezed back, tight.
I couldn't stand it any longer...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Typography:** The text is arranged in traditional vertical columns (tategaki), reading from right to left. The title is set in a bold, decorative serif-like font typical of mid-century Japanese magazines. 
*   **Visual Framing:** The page is framed by two hand-drawn illustrations of a man and a woman in profile at the top. They are looking away from each other, which creates a sense of tension or anonymous urban encounter, mirroring the story's theme.
*   **Structure:** The story is part of a recurring series or column, indicated by the header "あばずれ女の戀愛戰術" (Love Tactics of a Shameless Woman). The specific installment is titled "映画館の女" (The Woman at the Movie Theater).
*   **Pagination:** The page number "(48)" at the bottom suggests this was part of a larger literary or "low-brow" entertainment magazine.
*   **Punctuation and Formatting:** The text uses Japanese "waves" (〜) for emphasis or trailing sounds (e.g., ふら〜と, ぞく〜). The use of "××座" (XX-Theater) is a common trope in Japanese writing to redact specific names while maintaining a sense of realism.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (1940s-1950s):** The use of "Kyukanzukai" (old kana usage like ゐ, ゑ is absent, but old kanji like 戀 and 戰 are present) combined with the "Kasutori" magazine style points toward the late 1940s or early 1950s. The mention of "5,000 yen" for tuition/books is a significant amount for the early post-war period, indicating the narrator comes from a somewhat wealthy background or that inflation was high.
*   **The "Square Cap" (角帽 - Kakubou):** This refers to the traditional mortarboard cap worn by university students (notably Waseda or other elite universities) during the early to mid-20th century. It was a symbol of status and "seriousness," which makes the narrator's internal conflict between his lust and his "student dignity" more humorous.
*   **Movie Theater Culture:** In the post-war era, movie theaters were dark, anonymous spaces that served as popular spots for "nampa" (picking up women) or clandestine physical intimacy away from the watchful eyes of family.
*   **"Abazure" (あばずれ):** In modern Japanese, this is a derogatory term for a "slut" or "bitch." However, in the context of post-war pulp magazines (Kasutori magazines), it often referred to a "Modern Girl" or a woman who was sexually liberated, savvy, and unburdened by traditional morality—a figure of both fear and fascination.
*   **Geography:** Sanjo Kawaramachi and Kyogoku are famous entertainment and shopping districts in Kyoto, known for theaters and nightlife.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **あばずれ (Abazure):** Historically meant someone who has "worn away" their shame or social standing; an impudent or shameless person.
*   **かすりこり (Kasuriko):** Likely a play on *kasuri* (grazing/rubbing) and *koriru* (learning a lesson) or just a stylized title for a "flirting" tactic involving physical contact (rubbing).
*   **シケ込む (Shikekomu):** Slang for going into a hotel or a private place with someone for a sexual encounter.
*   **特等席 (Tokutoseki):** "Special Class" or premium seating in a theater, which would have been more expensive and slightly more private.
*   **風呂敷包み (Furoshiki-zutsumi):** A bundle wrapped in cloth. Carrying books this way was typical for students of the era.
*   **アブレイベル (Abureiberu):** This appears to be a phonetic transliteration or a specific slang term used in the story to refer to the "abazure" type. It might be a corruption of an English word or a very specific period slang.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Urban Anonymity:** The theater serves as a microcosm of the city where two strangers can engage in intimate physical contact without exchanging names or histories. 
*   **Rebellion Against Authority:** The story begins with the narrator lying to his parents to get money. This sets a tone of post-war youthful decadence and the breakdown of traditional filial piety.
*   **The "Modern" Woman vs. The "Good Family" Girl:** The narrator notes that the woman looks like a "refined lady from a good family" (良家のお嬢さん), but he quickly classifies her as an "abazure" because of her bold actions. This reflects a male anxiety/fantasy of the era: that even "respectable" women were secretly sexually predatory or liberated.
*   **Tactile Seduction:** The narrative focuses heavily on sensory details—the smell of perfume, the breeze from a fan, the warmth of a hand, and the "plumpness" of flesh. It is a very physical, non-verbal seduction.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Short Story, Fiction, Pulp Literature (Kasutori).
*   **Genre:** Erotica (light), Romance, Urban Drama.
*   **Themes:** Seduction, Post-war youth, Rebellion, City life, Hidden desires.
*   **Era:** Shōwa Era (Post-war, approx. 1948–1955).
