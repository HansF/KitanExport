私は二十三歳、とある中流家庭の娘でございます。
家族〔かぞく〕には内密で、近頃私は人妻を縛る〔しばる〕という趣味を覚え
ました。これは数ヶ月前、奇譚倶楽部を拝読して以来のことで、
自らもまさかこんな背徳的な遊戯に身を投ずるとは思ひませなんだ。
最初は見るだけでした。夜中に窓のすきまから。或る日、隣の奥様が
一人で居る時を狙ひ、私はとうとう、奥様の口を塞ぎ、襦袢を脱がせ、
白い絹の紐で手首と足首をきつく結び上げました。
彼女は最初震へて居ましたが、その内、羞恥と快感の入り混じつた
唸り声を上げ始め、私は完全に病みつきになつてしまつたのです。
これを止めなければ、私は常軌を逸した人間に成つてしまふやうに思へます。
どうしたら宜しいでせうか。
（東京府・S.K子）

これは数ヶ月前、奇譚クラブを拝読して以来のことで、
自らもまさかこんな背徳的な遊戯に身を投ずるとは思いませんでした。

一人でいる時を狙い、私はとうとう、奥様の口を塞ぎ、襦袢を脱がせ、

どうしたらよろしいでしょうか。

## Literal English Translation
To the Editorial Department:
I am twenty-three years old, the daughter of a certain middle-class family.
Secretly from my family, recently I acquired the hobby of tying up other men's wives.
This began several months ago, since I read the Kitan Club magazine.
I myself never thought I would throw myself into such a depraved game.
At first, I only watched. Through a gap in the window late at night. One day, aiming for a time when the lady next door was alone, I finally blocked the lady's mouth, made her take off her undergarment (juban), and tightly bound her wrists and ankles with white silk cord.
She was trembling at first, but soon, she began to utter groans mixed with shame and pleasure, and I have now become completely addicted.
If I do not stop this, I feel I will become a person who has lost all common sense.
What should I do?
(Tokyo Prefecture - S.K. daughter)

## Literary English Translation
To the Editors:
I am a twenty-three-year-old daughter of a respectable, middle-class family.
Unknown to my family, I have recently developed a fondness for restraining married women. This fascination began several months ago, sparked by reading *Kitan Club*. I never imagined I would involve myself in such a depraved pastime.
Initially, I was content merely to watch, peering through a gap in the window late at night. But one day, seizing the opportunity when the lady next door was alone, I finally covered her mouth, stripped off her *juban* (underclothes), and tightly secured her wrists and ankles with a white silk cord.
She was visibly shaking at first, but before long, she began emitting moans that blended shame and ecstasy. I have become completely obsessed.
I fear that if I don't stop this, I will lose my mind entirely.
What do you advise?
(S.K., Tokyo Prefecture)

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader Submission / Confession / Consultation Corner (読者投稿・相談). This highly personal, sensationalized account ending in a plea for advice is standard fare for participatory sections intended to shock and titillate.
*   **Author Attribution (Implicit):** S.K子 (S.K., daughter/girl). The anonymous signing convention protects the author while maintaining the sensational detail of the perpetrator being a young, unmarried woman (子).
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** Purely the narrator's voice, characterized by formal (historical kana usage, polite endings like でございます) yet agitated language, which lends credibility to the narrative's internal conflict (respectability vs. deviance).
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers fascinated by taboo sexual practices (BDSM, especially *shibari*), voyeurism, and the transgression of respectable social boundaries (middle-class women engaging in criminality/fetish).
*   **Positioning within the Magazine:** Likely placed in a high-interest content section dedicated to "True Experiences" or "Sexual Problems," possibly adjacent to other confessions or pseudo-clinical articles. The explicit mention of "奇譚倶楽部を拝読して以来" serves as self-referential promotional material.

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Postwar Sexuality:** The text is a product of the postwar Showa era (likely 1950s), where mass-market publications catered to a burgeoning interest in sexual deviance and fetishism, previously suppressed by strict Meiji/Taisho morality laws.
*   **Tokyo-fu (東京府):** The use of *Tokyo-fu* (Tokyo Prefecture) instead of *Tokyo-to* (Tokyo Metropolis) suggests either a historical dating prior to 1943 or a deliberate choice of older, more formal geographical terminology, often used in confessional letters to ground the narrative in a sense of genuine locality.
*   **Class Transgression:** The protagonist is a *musume* (unmarried daughter) from a *chūryū katei* (middle-class family). Her action—assaulting and binding a neighbor’s wife—is a severe transgression of class respectability and local community trust, enhancing the drama.
*   **Juban (襦袢):** The traditional Japanese undergarment, often worn beneath a kimono. Its removal signifies a profound act of undressing and humiliation, essential to the sexual power dynamic.
*   **The Mix of Shame and Pleasure (羞恥と快感):** This phrase is canonical within Japanese ero-guro literature, defining the core psychological experience of bondage and sadomasochism, emphasizing that the victim's pain/shame is integral to the perpetrator's arousal (and the victim’s eventual pleasure).

## Lexical & Semantic Notes (For NLP / AI Use)
*   **編集部 (Henshūbu):** Editorial Department. Used formally for submission.
*   **人妻を縛る (Hitotsuma o Shibaru):** The core fetish. Lit. "tying up a man's wife." Clear BDSM/bondage reference, capitalizing on the transgression against marriage/property rights.
*   **背徳的な遊戯 (Haitokuteki na Yūgi):** Immoral/Depraved pastime. Euphemism for socially unacceptable sexual or criminal acts.
*   **思ひませなんだ (Omohimasenanda):** Archaic/formal negative past tense construction (思ひませんでした), adding a layer of sincere regret or dramatic flourish.
*   **すきま (Sukima):** Gap/Crevice (窓のすきま). Crucial for establishing the voyeuristic starting point.
*   **襦袢 (Juban):** Undergarment. Specific cultural term for clothing removal.
*   **病みつき (Yamitsuki):** Addicted; obsessed. Indicates the compulsive nature of the fetish.
*   **常軌を逸した (Jōki o Isshita):** Lost common sense; deranged/insane. The ultimate feared consequence of moral transgression.

## Thematic & Subtext Analysis
*   **Dominant Themes:** Obsessive control, the thrill of criminality, BDSM initiation (from voyeur to active participant), and the psychological cost of deviance.
*   **Implicit Fantasies:** The fantasy is rooted in absolute, secret power over a respected, unavailable female figure (the married neighbor). The use of the "white silk cord" suggests a refinement of the fetish, blending aesthetic beauty with physical restraint.
*   **Ero-Guro Tropes:** The narrative fulfills several tropes: the decent citizen driven to obsession by media consumption (*Kitan Club*), the juxtaposition of purity and violence (silk cord binding the victim), and the focus on the victim's shift from terror to sexual pleasure (a common justification/fantasy element in BDSM narratives).
*   **What is Suggested but Not Stated:** The long-term repetition of the act is suggested by "病みつきになつてしまつた" (I have become addicted). The full extent of sexual violation beyond binding and stripping is left to the reader’s imagination, which is standard for maximizing sensationalism without explicit depiction.

## Content Classification Tags
*   Sexual content: High (Bondage, voyeurism, implied sexual assault/coercion, BDSM arousal described).
*   Violence: Moderate (Physical restraint, mouth blocking, forced disrobing).
*   Coercion: Explicit (Non-consensual restraint/sexual act).
*   Medical / bodily themes: None.
*   Taboo or illegal implications: High (Assault, unlawful restraint, possible break-in/trespassing).
