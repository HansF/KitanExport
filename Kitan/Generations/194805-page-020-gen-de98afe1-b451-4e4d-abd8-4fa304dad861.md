That also natural reason is. At Rakutenrō-setsu's

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

...and thrust it toward the ticket collector.
Given the situation, Kiyosaburō was startled. He hurriedly produced his ticket and blurted out,
"Shinimal."
"Huh?"
The schoolgirl looked puzzled. He felt he had exposed himself, but muttered,
"No..."
and, his ears turning bright red, he tried to hide his embarrassment by saying, "Say, wasn't there a Shinimal neighborhood in Kitahama?"
He managed to smoothly deceive her with the composure he usually maintained.
But it was at this exact moment. As he reached out to take his ticket back, the large umbrella he always carried slipped from his hand and, spinning around once in the air, crashed towards the floor.
In this grand, rose-colored room, he wondered, *'Is this a major disaster?'* In the split second he instinctively lunged to grab the umbrella, his palm, driven by the sheer force of his movement, landed square on the cute bottom of the girl standing backwards right in front of him.
*Pachin!*
He had slapped her.
"Ah! What was that!"
The girl cried out in shock.
She was scarlet, but Kiyosaburō's cheeks were a hundred times redder, as if dyed in flowing crimson.
"I—I tried to apologize for my blunder, but I panicked so much..."
"N-no, it's fine..."
The girl replied softly, and quickly hid her face with both hands, perhaps ashamed of being stared at by everyone.
And naturally so. Having one's virgin bottom spanked right in front of the Rakutenro building was probably a unique experience in the world, confined only to her.
Kiyosaburō stood with his head bowing repeatedly, drenched in gallons of cold sweat. Despite this, he was still the same person who dashed along the busy streets between the exchange and his company, constantly checking the ups and downs of the market trends over the course of an hour, managing massive sums of money. A lapse in concentration meant the worst possible loss.
He was obsessed with his business.
Following the cabinet collapse, rumors of a desired Liberal Party government dominated the political climate. Foreign capital seemed ready to rush in this month, causing a fever pitch in the market, which ultimately yielded outrageous profits. Thanks to Kiyosaburō's involvement in the business of trading new stock certificates at unexpectedly high prices, he made a profit of twenty-seven yen per share—a single strike that earned him several hundred thousand yen.
The feeling he had, which would make him laugh and feel like the hero of some farce—a feeling understood only by those in the trade—was that of a mysterious jackpot, a stroke of luck, amidst this bizarre commotion. He felt that fortune had unexpectedly rolled in, perhaps due to some fate he had conceived just now. But where was the cause of this luck?
But then, he suddenly realized: the bundle of bills in his hand, instead of being his umbrella handle, reminded him of the soft, yielding sensation of the girl's bottom.
(That's it!)
He instinctively emitted a silent urge, and the palm of his right hand clenched with power.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is presented in *tategaki* (vertical script), read from right to left, typical of Japanese literary publications from the mid-Showa period (1940s–1960s).

**Structure and Layout:**
1.  **Main Narrative:** The primary text runs across several columns (likely 5 columns deep in this snippet). The columns are narrow and densely packed with characters.
2.  **Typography:** Uses a standard Minchō (serif) typeface. Dialogue is marked by Japanese quotation marks (「」).
3.  **Furigana:** Small *kana* characters (furigana) are used beside some kanji (e.g., 處女—ところ, 瓦解解—がかい). This practice aids readers encountering complex or historical terms, or confirms pronunciation for names, and is highly characteristic of magazine fiction aimed at a broad audience in this era.
4.  **Formatting/Emphasis:**
    *   Repeating marks are used for repetition (ペコ／＼ for *peko-peko*).
    *   Ellipses (...) indicate trailed-off speech or thought.
    *   Exclamations points (!) are used in dialogue.
    *   The parenthesis surrounding "(そうだ!)" denotes an internal realization or strong thought.
5.  **Section Break/Title Box:** Near the bottom, the continuous flow of text is interrupted by a small, vertically oriented box with a decorative dotted border. This box clearly serves as a title or header for a new, featured piece of content, likely a new chapter or a different story being presented on the same page.
    *   The title box contains a genre/series title ("ネオ・カスマ 愛経") and the main title of the new piece ("女學生がボタンを外した話").

**Visual Hierarchy:** The title box draws immediate attention, signaling a transition in content. The use of small characters for the *ai-kyō* (愛経) subtitle within the box suggests it is part of a recurring series or categorization.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Publication Era (1940s-1960s):** The content strongly reflects the social and economic atmosphere of post-war Japan, specifically the period of recovery and rapid modernization (often associated with the 1950s and early 1960s).

1.  **Economic Context (Speculation):** The detailed mention of "内閣瓦解" (Cabinet collapse), "自由党内閣待望" (Longing for a Liberal Party cabinet), "外資" (foreign capital inflow), "新株券" (new stock certificates), and "相場師" (speculator) places the story squarely during a time of intense market volatility and speculative boom, common during periods of political realignment and economic restructuring (like the rapid expansion phase following the Korean War boom). The protagonist, Kiyosaburō, is a businessman (or perhaps a salaryman playing the market) deeply entrenched in this high-stakes world, where fortunes (五數圓—hundreds of thousands of yen) can be made or lost "in one strike."
2.  **Social Context (Gender and Morality):** The text features a "女学生" (schoolgirl or young female student), a figure often used in Showa literature to represent relative innocence or modernity. The transgression—slapping her bottom in public—is treated as a source of extreme shame ("処女のお尻を叩かれたのは、世界中でもおそらく、彼女位のものだろう" - "in the whole world probably, she alone thing it would be"). This highlights the strict societal boundaries regarding public sexuality and the protection of female innocence, even as those boundaries were tested by modernization.
3.  **Literary Genre (Eroticism and Pulp Fiction):** The boxed section introduces the genre "ネオ・カスマ 愛経" (Neo-Kama Sutra, Love Sutra). This indicates the text is likely published in a popular magazine or *kasutori* culture publication, which often blended serious fiction with sensationalist, semi-erotic narratives (*ero-guro-nansensu* heritage). The central incident (the slap) and the subsequent title (the unbuttoned shirt) reinforce this tone.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

| Term (Original) | Modern Equivalent (Rōmaji) | Meaning & Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| キョツとした (キョツ) | Gyottoshita | To be startled, shocked, or taken aback. (Often rendered as ギョッ). |
| シニマル | Shinimal | A place name, possibly a stylized reference to "Cinema-Maru" or a fictional location like "Shinimal Town" (シニマル町). Its specific meaning remains ambiguous but sounds Westernized/modern. |
| 蝙蝠傘 | Kōmorigasa | Literally "bat umbrella," meaning a Western-style folding or non-folding umbrella. Used commonly in the early 20th century. |
| 處女 (処女) | Shojo | Virgin (referring here specifically to the girl's status). |
| 冷汗三斗 | Reikan santo | An idiom meaning "three quarts of cold sweat." Signifies extreme anxiety, fear, or embarrassment. |
| 活氣島の巷道 | Kakkishima no kōdō | The bustling streets/avenues of a lively district or "island" (often referring metaphorically to a concentrated commercial area). |
| 内閣瓦解解 (瓦解) | Naikaku Gakai | Cabinet collapse or dissolution, a political term central to the narrative's economic background. |
| 相場師 | Sōbashi | A speculator or stock market trader. |
| 利喰い | Rigui | Profit-taking; realizing gains in the stock market. |
| 叫糸 | Kyōshi | An extremely rare or possibly erroneous term. Literal meaning is "scream thread." Contextually interpreted as a deep, silent, instinctual urge or emotional reaction (a *thread* of a cry/emotion). (Normalization often treats it contextually as 叫び - cry/urge). |
| ネオ・カスマ 愛経 | Neo-Kasu-ma Ai-kyō | "Neo-Kama Sutra, Love Sutra." A sensationalist genre title implying modern sexual or relationship commentary, adopting the structure of religious texts (*kyō* - sutra). |

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**The Interplay of Lust, Luck, and Capital:** The central theme revolves around the protagonist, Kiyosaburō, linking sudden, illicit physical transgression (the slap) with subsequent financial fortune. The climax occurs when he realizes the sensation of the money bundle in his hand reminds him of the girl's "soft, yielding bottom."

*   **Subtext of Exchange:** The text subtly posits that the random, aggressive act—the slap—is mysteriously connected to the "当たりの" (jackpot/luck) in his ruthless financial dealings. It suggests that fortune requires a kind of bold, transgressive action. The physical violence/impropriety against the symbol of innocence (the *shojo*) is implicitly equated with the risk-taking necessary for extreme wealth generation in the speculative post-war economy.
*   **The Deceptive Persona:** Kiyosaburō oscillates between extreme social embarrassment (cold sweat, bowing repeatedly) and immediate re-immersion into high-stakes business (bloodshot eyes, obsessed). He successfully uses his "everyday's heart" (日頃の心臓) to "deceive" the situation, showing a psychological split between his public self and his calculated, profit-driven inner self.
*   **Melodrama and Sensationalism:** The tone is highly dramatic ("three quarts of cold sweat," cheeks "a hundred times redder," "room of roses"). This heightened melodrama is a rhetorical strategy characteristic of pulp fiction designed to engage readers by exaggerating emotional stakes and moral consequences, even for a brief, accidental slap.
