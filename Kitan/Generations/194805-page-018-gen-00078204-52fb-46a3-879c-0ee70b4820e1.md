...was. In the kitchen, severe locks were placed, but this rice
taking out of thing, totally impossible was, therefore
from, at night rice stealing such as
of declaration, impossible discussion had been,
Kawada was seriously ill with beri-beri. Every day, opening the window wide
looking at the street, he lived.
At that time, Kawada was yelled at, by the dormitory representative
who came to visit his folding-room.

"Oh, how is it, your body?"

"Yeah, so-so. Also, how is the situation with the affliction in town recently?"
"What? Affliction? Yeah, same as usual. It's totally
like water. Yesterday, I strongly
protested at the office."
"Well, did you look for the culprit?"
"Yeah, totally couldn't find them."
"Haha, that must be right, I suppose. However,
you shouldn't hold back, but
can you identify the criminal?" (Lit: can it sting/pierce you?)
"Oh, they are identified. There are two culprits."
"Hmm, you, who can't even walk, understood well. So who is the culprit, the person you refer to?"

"Of course I can do that."
"Tell me the difference (the facts)."
"No, one person is Matsumoto, the chief of the kitchen.
He, at night, opens the lock and in the kitchen, big
rice which was bagged, puts it into a bag."
"Did you see it?"
"No, it's deduction. Listen,
Matsumoto gives the bagged rice to Horikawa, a dormitory student,
to pass it on to......"
"What! Horikawa!"
"Yeah, that guy is the accomplice. And
Horikawa hides it in that corner. Soon, when the night opens
(day breaks). The guard, opening the main door of the entrance,
definitely enters the kitchen.
When he closes the entrance, nobody
is there either.
Then, the bagged rice, three straw bags worth, he puts it into the designated
garbage can."
"After that?"
"After that, all of it is the guard's breakfast. The
cleaning of that bin, Matsumoto makes Kawada and the guard
clean the bin, that's what happens."
"Excellent deduction, but is there evidence?"
"Evidence? I don't need such a thing."
"Why!"
"Because I was watching every night from this spot."

### Title and Author
**A Humorous Novel**
**The Woman Who Put Copper in Her Palm**
**By Umeji Umemura**

### Story Text
...was the situation. Although the kitchen was heavily locked, taking the rice out was considered utterly impossible. Because making a public confession about stealing rice at night was out of the question, Kawada, who was seriously ill with beriberi, spent his days opening the window wide and watching the street traffic.
Just then, the dormitory representative, whom Kawada had shouted for, came to his makeshift room for a visit.

“Hey, how are you feeling?”

“Oh, so-so. But tell me, how are things with that affliction plaguing the town recently?”
“What? Affliction? Oh, same as usual. It’s like pure water—it just disappears. I lodged a serious protest with the office yesterday.”
“So, did you find the culprits?”
“Nope, couldn’t find anyone at all.”
“Haha, I suppose that’s right. But listen, you shouldn’t be reserved. Can you nail them?” (Can you identify the criminals?)
“Oh, I’ve nailed them. There are two culprits.”
“Hmm, that’s impressive, seeing as you can’t even walk. So, who are these so-called criminals?”

“I can certainly tell you.”
“Then enlighten me.”
“Well, one is Matsumoto, the chief of the kitchen. He opens the lock late at night and puts the large bags of rice—which he’s already bagged up—into another bag in the kitchen.”
“Did you see this?”
“No, it’s a deduction. Listen. Matsumoto hands the bagged rice over to Horikawa, a dormitory student, to pass along…”
“What! Horikawa!”
“Yes, that guy is the accomplice. Horikawa hides it in the corner. Soon, when night breaks, the guard opens the main door of the entrance and always enters the kitchen. When he locks the entrance, no one else is around. At that point, Matsumoto puts three bags of rice into the designated garbage can.”
“And then?”
“Then, all of that becomes the guard’s breakfast. Matsumoto arranges for the cleaning of that bin to be done by Kawada—*and* the guard.” (Implied sarcasm/pun)
“That’s an excellent deduction. But do you have proof?”
“Proof? I don’t need proof for this.”
“Why not!”
“Because I was watching from this very spot every night.”

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The image presents a segment of a publication, structured in traditional Japanese vertical writing (*tategaki*), read from right to left, top to bottom.

**Layout and Structure:**
The page is organized into several vertical columns. The rightmost section contains a short, self-contained anecdotal story (the "Humor Novel" core), while the leftmost columns appear to contain a related essayistic or observational piece.

1.  **Title Block:** A prominent title block separates the content: **ユーモア小説** (Humor Novel) written vertically, followed by the specific story title **掌に銅を入れし女** (The Woman Who Put Copper in Her Palm) and the author **楳村梅次 作** (Written by Umemura Umeji).
2.  **Typography:** The main text uses standard Mincho-style font common in print media. The title utilizes a bolder, more stylized font, possibly simulating brush strokes, typical of pre-digital layouts.
3.  **Visual Element:** A small, simple illustration of a bespectacled face looking downward is placed within the introductory space, possibly representing the detective/narrator or a thematic element related to observation. The illustration is captioned/associated with the phrase **灰色** (Gray Color/Gray matter/Gray area), though the full context of this caption is unclear in the fragment.
4.  **Punctuation:** Archaic Japanese punctuation is used, including the traditional vertical dot/circle for periods and large open spaces following quotation marks in vertical text.
5.  **Text Flow:** The core story (Columns 1–4, R to L) features dialogue marked by specific quote indicators (「」). The essayistic segments (Columns 5–6, L side) are continuous narrative observations. The page number "— 18 —" is centered horizontally at the bottom.

**Hierarchy:** The title and author are the strongest visual elements. The right-hand column, containing the main story dialogue, establishes the immediate narrative focus.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Publication Era (1940s–1960s):** The use of *kyūjitai* (old character forms like 嚴重) and *historical kana orthography* (e.g., あつた, だつた, てゐる) suggests the text originated in the early to mid-Showa era, likely pre-1949 or in a conservative publication immediately following the orthographic reforms, although some older forms persisted informally.

**Beri-Beri (脚気, *Kakké*):** Kawada is described as having "serious beriberi." Beri-beri was rampant in early 20th-century Japan, particularly among students and military personnel, due to diets heavily reliant on polished white rice, which lacks Thiamine (Vitamin B1). The disease caused severe neurological and cardiac symptoms. Kawada’s confinement due to *kakké* is not just a narrative device but a common reality of the era.

**Social Vices and "Civilization Sickness" (文明病, *Bunmeibyō*):** The essay fragment discusses various *kuse* (habits/vices) such as smoking, drinking, and left-handedness, classifying them as congenital or acquired. The term *Bunmeibyō* (Civilization Sickness) was a popular mid-Showa critique of the health and social problems (like excessive drinking or smoking) brought on by rapid modernization and Western influence.

**Slang and Terminology:**
*   **ナンマイダ (Nammaida):** Referenced in the far-left column, this is likely an abbreviation or slang term derived from the Buddhist invocation "Namu Amida Butsu." Here it is used as the "common name" for dangerous drinking or alcoholism, suggesting a sense of fatalism or resignation associated with the vice.
*   **株屋 (Kabuya):** Stockbroker/stock market trader. References to *kabuya* and making millions (*hyakuman-en*) overnight point to the volatility and opportunities present in the post-war Japanese economy, especially in the 1950s reconstruction boom.

**Humor Style:** The core anecdote functions as a reversal joke, common in mid-century humor. The elaborate, detective-style deduction is suddenly undercut by the simple, anti-climactic truth: the detective character wasn't deducing; he was merely observing. This shift from high intellectual effort to mundane reality provides the humor.

| **いらん** | いらん | I don't need (colloquial/dialect). | いらない (*iranai*) |
| **文明病** | ぶんめいびょう | Civilization sickness; social diseases resulting from modern life. | A specific term of social criticism common in the Showa era. |

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**Theme of Observation vs. Deduction:**
The central conflict in the dialogue-driven story is the solving of a petty crime (rice theft). The listener (Kawada) sets up the narrative framework as a great intellectual feat—*suiri* (deduction)—but the climax reveals the narrator’s methodology was sheer, dedicated *kanshō* (observation: "I was watching every night"). The story mocks the intellectualism of detective fiction, favoring the simpler, often funnier, truth.

**Social Critique of Necessity:**
The theft itself highlights necessity: the rice is stolen because the system prevents honest acquisition ("totally impossible" to take out the rice). The theft involves not just the immediate hunger of the students but the corruption of the system, implicating the kitchen chief (Matsumoto) and the guard (Emon). The ultimate victim seems to be the collective, represented by the ill student Kawada, whose food supply is being raided.

**The Critique of Modern Habits (Essay Fragment):**
The adjacent essay fragment juxtaposes innate versus acquired habits, specifically focusing on drinking and smoking—the "civilization sicknesses." By placing this discussion next to a story about mundane corruption and sickness (beri-beri), the text subtly links societal moral decay (theft) with the physical decay resulting from modern vices. Both are costly, burdensome aspects of contemporary life.

**Tone:** The tone of the story is light, witty, and slightly cynical. It uses colloquial language and relies on an anti-climax for humor. The essay tone is observational and mildly critical.
