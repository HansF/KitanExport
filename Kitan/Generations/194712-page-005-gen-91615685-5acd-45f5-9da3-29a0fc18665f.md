## Original Japanese (Verbatim Transcription)
私の「緊縛」の趣味と云ふものは、思ひ出すと遠い昔、
丁度中学へ入つたばかりのころ、隣りの家の姉さんの背中
に出来た大きい「腫れ物」（フデモノ）が破れて、そこから膿と
血がドロドロと流れるのを見た時に、突然、芽生えたもの
らしい。その姉さんは、いかにも痛さうな顔をして、両手
をうしろへ廻し、私達の村で昔から「女縛り」に使ふ太い麻
繩で、自分自身をグルグルと縛り付けた。あれは、なんと
も云へない「恍惚」の瞬間であつた。今でもその姉さんの
白い肌と、汚ない膿の匂ひ、そして強烈な麻繩のきつさが、
私の股間を疼かせる。私は「奇譚」を求めてゐる。

## Literal English Translation
My taste, which is called "Kinbaku" (bondage), seems to have suddenly sprouted long ago, when I recall it,
just when I had entered middle school, when I saw the large "swelling" (fudemono) that had appeared on the back of the older sister in the neighboring house
break open, and pus and blood flow out thickly from it.
That older sister, making an extremely painful-looking face,
put both hands behind her, and with thick hemp
rope, which our village has used since old times for "Onna Shibari" (women's tying), she tightly bound herself round and round. That was a moment of indescribable "ecstasy." Even now, that older sister's white skin, the dirty smell of the pus, and the intense tightness of the hemp rope, cause my groin to ache. I am seeking "Kitan" (strange/marvelous tales).

## Literary English Translation
My proclivity for *Kinbaku*, or bondage, seems to have been born suddenly, long ago. I recall it happened just after I had entered middle school, when I witnessed the large "swelling" (*fudemono*) on the back of the girl next door burst open, and thick pus and blood came oozing out.
That older sister, wearing a thoroughly pained expression, twisted both arms behind her and used the thick hemp rope—the kind our village has historically reserved for "women's tying"—to bind herself tightly, round and round. That was a moment of utterly indescribable "ecstasy." Even now, the memory of her white skin, the foul stench of the pus, and the fierce constriction of the hemp rope, causes a throbbing ache in my loins. I continue to seek out *Strange Tales*.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis
*   **Likely Section Type:** Reader confession or personal experience essay (*Shumi Kokuhaku* or *Dokusha Jikken*), typical of *Kitan Club*'s content meant to explore taboo sexual origins and fetishes.
*   **Author Attribution:** Anonymous (Implied reader submission, often given a pseudonym or geographic marker, but here unnamed).
*   **Editorial Voice vs Narrator Voice:** Entirely first-person narrator (retrospective confession).
*   **Target Audience Signals:** Readers interested in the psychological origins of sexual perversion, the overlap of pain and pleasure (S/M), and grotesque/bodily themes (Ero-Guro).
*   **Positioning within the magazine:** Likely placed early or mid-section (Page 18) to hook readers with sensational content, potentially accompanied by a drawing or stylized bondage photography.

---

## Cultural & Historical Notes
*   **Kinbaku (緊縛):** Japanese rope bondage. The text positions the narrator's interest not merely as a modern urban fetish but as a psychological compulsion rooted in childhood trauma.
*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** This passage perfectly exemplifies the core aesthetic of the Ero-Guro (Erotic-Grotesque) movement by linking sexual ecstasy (**恍惚**) directly to bodily decay and sickness (the bursting abscess, pus, blood).
*   **Fudemono (腫れ物/フデモノ):** This specific, often large, infected swelling or carbuncle provides the "grotesque" element. The clinical detail contrasts with the erotic outcome, a key literary technique of the period.
*   **Onna Shibari (女縛り):** Literally "women's tying." Framing the act as a "village custom" lends a pseudo-historical, archaic, and ritualistic weight to what is fundamentally a fetishistic practice, a common strategy in Showa-era pulp fiction to deepen the sense of dark mystique.
*   **Postwar Psychological Context:** The period saw intense interest in linking complex sexual desires to formative childhood experiences or shocking visual stimuli, reflecting a societal preoccupation with psychological trauma and suppressed desires following the war.

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms
*   **緊縛 (Kinbaku):** Bondage; often implies highly aesthetic and specific Japanese rope techniques (Shibari).
*   **腫れ物 (Haremono):** Swelling, boil, or abscess. The furigana **フデモノ (Fudemono)** is possibly a specific medical/slang term for a large, severe carbuncle or tumor, emphasizing its visual impact.
*   **ドロドロ (Doro-doro):** Thick, viscous, sluggish flowing. Used here to make the discharge of pus and blood maximally repulsive/sensational.
*   **恍惚 (Kōkotsu):** Ecstasy, rapture, bliss. Used to describe the sexual/emotional shock felt upon witnessing the trauma.
*   **股間 (Kokan):** Groin; euphemistic for the genital area or sexual organs.
*   **疼かせる (Uzukaseru):** To cause to ache or throb; used here to signify sexual arousal or powerful physical yearning stimulated by the memory.
*   **奇譚 (Kitan):** Strange/marvelous tales; the title of the magazine and the genre of unusual, often sexual, narratives sought by the author.

## Themes & Subtext
*   **Trauma as Sexual Origin:** The primary subtext is the establishment of a BDSM/bondage fetish stemming directly from witnessing a traumatic fusion of pain, self-restraint, and biological disgust.
*   **Sickness and Purity:** The contrast between "white skin" and "dirty pus/smell" suggests a powerful drive to integrate or master contamination through desire. The sexual attraction is contingent on the presence of decay.
*   **Self-Punishment/Control:** The older sister binds herself to manage pain. The narrator's fetish is therefore rooted in observing the voluntary (yet necessary) subjugation of the body.
*   **Voyeurism and Initiation:** The narrator, as a young boy, is initiated into this complex sexuality purely through observation, establishing a lifelong pattern of seeking out the strange and constrained (Kitan).

---

## Content Classification Tags
*   **Sexual Content:** High (Explicit discussion of fetishism, BDSM, and physical arousal).
*   **Violence/Coercion:** Medium (Describes self-binding under duress of pain, interpreted erotically by the narrator).
*   **Medical / Bodily Themes:** High (Graphic description of bursting abscess, pus, and blood).
*   **Taboo or Illegal Implications:** Low (Describes a personal memory and sexual interest).
