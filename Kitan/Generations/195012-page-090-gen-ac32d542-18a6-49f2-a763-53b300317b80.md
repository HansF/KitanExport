……の殿堂だということが、おぼろげにも分つて来た。
分りかけて来た時にや、清子はめてしまえばよかったのだが、何となくその裏を知つてみたい欲望が、若い清子の身体に浮び上つてくるのを、どうすることも出来ぬのかしら？　知らぬ世界への憧れ、と云つては変だが、それ等が物懐しく考えられて、熱い血が彼女等の肉体をかけめぐるのだった。
　が、それを知る機会が、つまり清子にとつて、あやまつた第一歩を踏む時が、間もなくおとづれたのだった。
　スタンドの前でとろけるような甘い音楽に聞き入つていた清子に、
「あなたは、映画がお好きですか？」
と、馴れ馴れしく話しかけてきたのは、松井という有名な実業家だつた。
　突然の言葉で彼女はどぎまぎしながら、それでもおちついて答えた。
「え、大好きですの」
「ぢや、これから御覧になりませんか？　今度、それは面白い映画が或る処から入つたんです。もう少し経つと、向うで始まりますから、私と見に行つてくれませんか？」
「有難うございます。でも、あたくし、こちらのお勤めがありますから……」
「いやあ、そんな事あ、構やしませんよ、あなたさえ承知なら」
「え？」
「いや、あなたが、私と一緒に見かつた。
　清子と同じように三人程まだこのクラブに働いていた。彼女達には、入ることを禁じられている、ドアの向うには、何があるのだろうか？　そこから消えて、長い間廣間へ姿を見せない、マダムと女のような歌舞伎役者は、どうして……」

**[Bottom Section]**
なくて、たゞ一人の肉親を見殺しする我が身の不甲斐なさに絶望の日々を送つて居たのだった。
「君の方で都合がついたのならいいけれどね、若しまだ困っているのだねえ……」
由美はまだ、上の意を計りかねて居た。
（若しかしたら戸上は妾の肉体を狙つて居るのでは――）
此の興行切つてのドンファンである戸上に肉体を捧げた踊り子は何人あつた事であろう。
ストリップ・ショー等におちて来る踊り子は、必らずと言つていい程、金が目当てであつた。
自己の肉体のすみずみまでを、観客の前にサラス、と云う事は余程の事情と好条件がない限り花羞しい乙女達には出来ぬ事である。
そして女性としての最も恥しい事を同じするならば、少しでも収入を多くしたい、と思うのは人情で、そこをつけ込んだ戸上が、プロデューサーと云う地位を利用して、踊り子達の貞操を、次々と奪つて居たのだった。
と云つて、無下に戸上の要求を退けたならば、忽ちにして職を失い、たゞ一人の兄の入院費は愚か我身の明日の生活にも事欠く状態なのだ。由美は突嗟に身を捨てて兄を救おうと決心した。
「どんな事でしょう。」
「実は僕の友人が、大阪の、或るナイトクラブのプロデューサーをやつて居るんだ。それがストリップの出来る女の子を一人欲しい、と云つて来ているのでね、条件がとても良いし、丁度君が、金が欲しいと云つて居るのを知つたものだから、それに君の身体とマスクが向うの要求に、ピタリとはまつているので君を紹介しようと、思つて居るのだが――」
由美の心配も決心も一時に吹きとんでしまった。舞台で裸になるのならどこでも同じ事だ、条件次第によつては飛び付いても良い、と眉をひいた。
「私みたいなものが……」
「いや、うちの女の子の中で君が一番適して居るんだ給料は三万円……」

...that it was a palace of [something], vaguely also understood became.
When it started to be understood, for Seiko, ending it would have been good, but somehow that behind-the-scenes wanting to know desire, in young Seiko’s body floating up coming, how can nothing be done? Longing for an unknown world, saying so is strange, but those things nostalgicly were thought of, and hot blood her and others’ bodies through raced.
But, the opportunity to know that, in other words for Seiko, the mistaken first step stepping time, before long visited.
At the stand, melting-like sweet music listening to Seiko,
"You, movies do you like?"
Thus, familiarly speaking came was Matsui called famous businessman was.
By sudden words she being flustered while, even so calmly answered.
"Yes, love them I do."
"Then, from now shall we view? This time, a very interesting movie from a certain place entered. A little bit later, over there begins, so with me to see won't you go?"
"Thank you. But, I, here work have, so..."
"No, such a thing, mind I do not, if you only agree."
"Eh?"
"No, you, with me together..."

**[Bottom Section]**
...not, and the only one blood relative letting die my own helplessness in, despair days was sending.
"If your side convenience was made it's fine, but if still troubled you are..."
Yumi still, the superior's intent could not measure.
(Perhaps Togami my flesh is aiming for?)
This production's greatest Don Juan being Togami, to him flesh offered dancers how many were there?
Strip shows etc. falling into dancers, almost always as can be said, money was the aim.
Own flesh's every corner, before audience exposing, such a thing, considerable circumstances and good conditions unless there are, shy maidens cannot do thing it is.
And as a woman most shameful thing if doing, even a little income want to increase, thinking is human nature, and taking advantage of that Togami, "Producer" called position using, dancers' chastity one after another was taking.
If flatly Togami's request refused, immediately job lose, and only one brother's hospital fees let alone own tomorrow's life even lacking state it is. Yumi in an instant self discarding brother to save decided.
"What kind of thing is it?"
"Actually my friend, Osaka's, a certain nightclub producer is doing. He striptease capable girl one wants, saying has come. Conditions are very good, and just you, money want saying I knew, plus your body and 'mask' (face) the other side's demand perfectly fits, so you introduce I am thinking—"
Yumi's worry and hesitation at once blew away. If on stage becoming naked, anywhere is the same thing; depending on conditions, pouncing on it is fine, she thought.
"A person like me..."
"No, among our girls you are the most suitable. Salary is 30,000 yen..."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**[Top Section: Seiko's Temptation]**
...She had begun to vaguely realize that this was a "palace" of a certain sort. At that moment of realization, it would have been better for Seiko to turn back, but a restless desire to see what lay behind the curtain bubbled up within her young body, and she found she could do nothing to suppress it. It might be strange to call it a longing for the unknown, but the thought filled her with a peculiar nostalgia, and hot blood raced through her veins. 
The opportunity to satisfy this curiosity—the moment Seiko would take her first mistaken step—arrived soon enough. As she stood by the counter, lost in the meltingly sweet music, a man approached her with an overly familiar air.
"Do you like movies?" he asked. It was Matsui, a well-known businessman.
Startled by the sudden approach, she managed to maintain her composure. "Yes, I love them," she replied.
"Well then, why don't we go see one now? I’ve just acquired a very interesting film from a particular source. It’s starting soon in the back room. Won't you come and watch it with me?"
"Thank you, but I'm on duty here..."
"Oh, don't worry about that. It’s no problem at all, as long as you're willing."
"What?"
"I mean, I want you to see it with me..."

**[Bottom Section: Yumi's Desperation]**
...Having no other choice, she spent her days in despair, feeling utterly worthless as she watched her only living relative slide toward death.
"It's fine if you've sorted things out on your end, but if you're still in trouble..."
Yumi was still trying to gauge the intentions of her superior. *Is Togami after my body?* she wondered. Togami was the production's notorious Don Juan; one could only guess how many dancers had already surrendered themselves to him. 
Almost without exception, the girls who ended up in strip shows did so for the money. To expose every inch of one’s naked body to an audience is not something a modest young woman would ever do unless driven by extreme circumstances or the promise of extraordinary pay. It is only human nature that if one is to do the most shameful thing a woman can do, one would want to be paid as much as possible for it. Togami, a man who preyed on this reality, used his position as a producer to systematically rob these dancers of their virtue.
Yet, if Yumi were to flatly refuse him, she would lose her job instantly. She wouldn't be able to pay her brother's hospital bills, let alone feed herself tomorrow. In an instant, she resolved to sacrifice herself to save her brother.
"What did you have in mind?" she asked.
"Actually, a friend of mine is a producer at a nightclub in Osaka. He's looking for a girl who can do striptease. The terms are excellent. Since I knew you were looking for money, and because your figure and face perfectly match what they're looking for, I thought I'd recommend you."
In that moment, Yumi’s worries and hesitations vanished. If she had to strip on stage, it didn't matter where she did it. If the conditions were right, she was ready to jump at the chance.
"Someone like me...?"
"Nonsense. Of all the girls here, you're the best fit. The salary is 30,000 yen..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is divided into two distinct narrative blocks, likely from a serialized story or a collection of "confession" style pieces. The top and bottom are separated by an illustration.
*   **Typography:** The text uses vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). It employs a mix of *kyūjitai* (traditional kanji) and early post-war simplifications. The use of "historical kana" (e.g., 云つて for 言って, 出来ぬ for できない) is consistent with the era.
*   **Illustrations:** 
    *   The top illustration shows a sophisticated urban setting—a man in a suit (Matsui) and a stylishly dressed woman (Seiko) at a bar or club. 
    *   The middle illustration shows a line of "chorus girls" or strippers in minimal clothing, juxtaposed with a man observing them, highlighting the "commodity" nature of the women's bodies.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Large, bold fonts are not used here; the narrative flows steadily, suggesting this is a literary or "documentary" feature rather than a flashy advertisement.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Strip Show Craze (c. 1947–1952):** After WWII, "strip shows" (*sutorippu*) became a massive fad in Japan, starting at theaters like the Shinjuku Teito-za. They were often framed as "artistic" to bypass censorship, but were primarily a symptom of the desperate economic climate and the relaxing of pre-war moral codes.
*   **Economic Desperation:** The story mentions a brother's hospital bills. In the late 40s/early 50s, Japan had no universal health insurance, and many families were driven to the brink by the cost of treating illnesses like tuberculosis. 
*   **The "Producer" Figure:** In pulp fiction of this era, the "Producer" or "Businessman" is often portrayed as a predatory figure who exploits young women's poverty. The mention of "Osaka" suggests the interconnectedness of the urban nightlife circuits (Tokyo/Osaka).
*   **Monetary Value:** The figure "30,000 yen" is significant. In the early 1950s, the starting salary for a college-educated male office worker was roughly 5,000 to 10,000 yen. Offering 30,000 yen was an astronomical sum, explaining why Yumi's "hesitation vanished."

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **殿堂 (Dendō):** Usually "palace" or "hall." Here used metaphorically for a den of vice or a grand entertainment venue.
*   **実業家 (Jitsugyōka):** Businessman/Entrepreneur. Often carried a connotation of power and wealth in these stories.
*   **ドンファン (Don Fan):** Don Juan. Used to describe a predatory womanizer.
*   **貞操 (Teisō):** Chastity/Virtue. A heavy moral term in the 1950s.
*   **マスク (Masuku):** Literally "mask," but in show business slang of the time, it referred to a person's facial features or "looks."
*   **物懐しく (Mononatsukashiku):** A sense of yearning or a strange feeling of nostalgia for something not yet experienced.
*   **花羞しい (Hanahazukashii):** "Flower-shaming" modesty. Describes a young woman’s natural shyness.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Poverty as an Engine for Vice:** The text explicitly links moral "fall" (stripping, loss of virginity) to economic necessity. The narrative doesn't judge the girls as much as it highlights the "unavoidable" nature of their choices.
*   **Predatory Masculinity:** Both Matsui and Togami represent men who use their status and the promise of "opportunity" to exploit young women.
*   **The Allure of the Forbidden:** Seiko’s segment focuses on the psychological curiosity (*yokubō* - desire) of seeing the "back side" of the world, suggesting that the "fall" begins with curiosity before it ends in necessity.
*   **Sensationalism:** This is classic *kasutori* (3-go/pulp) magazine content. It provides a titillating "behind-the-scenes" look at the world of nightclubs and striptease under the guise of a tragic social commentary.
