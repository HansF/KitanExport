## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

「今晩は、おぢさん」
思いがけなく馴々しい呼聲にびつくりした彼が、ふりかえつてみるとそこには花なら咲いたばかり、十八九美しい洋装の娘が、可愛らしい口許に、につと微笑を浮べて立つているではないか。
「はあ、これが今流行のパンパンガールとゆう奴かな――」と思つて、彼は一寸好奇心にかられた。彼が微笑を返すと娘はいきなり自分の右腕を彼の左腕へからませた。二人はそのまま、近くの横町へ入つた。
「いくら要るんだね」
「三枚と云いたいんだけど……飛切勉強の一枚でいいわよ」
「ホウ、それで……」
――一つ経験してみようかな――と横山氏は思つた。
「ほらあのホテルで、ね、さあ行きましょうお客さん」
娘は彼を引張るやうにしてぐんぐん歩く。
――どうやらカモは上カモだわ、これから面白くなるのさ――娘はくつくつと口の中で笑つた。その娘は花子であつた。
ホテルへ入ると花子が室の交渉をつけた。二人は七號と番號のついた室へ案内された。そこは十疊程の廣さのダブルベッドがぎうぎうよろしくデンと據えられてある室だった。
「君はまだお孃さんのようだが、どうしてこんなことをしているのかね」
横山氏は折鞄をベッドの上へ置きそこへ腰かけて花子の手を握つて聞いた。
「そんな野暮なことを聞かないでよそれよりあんた、お風呂へ入らない、氣持がいいわよ、とても」
花子は媚るように笑つて、このホテルには浴室付の室はないけれども、落付いて入れる家族風呂があるのよと説明する。

（中略 - Illustration area)

そこで二人は一緒にその風呂へ入ることになつて、室を出ると横山氏は、思出したようにドアへ鍵をかけた。
「いや一寸でも油断のならぬ世の中な」
彼は折鞄に入つている五萬圓の札束を思いだしていた。その鍵をポケツトに納めようとすると何と思つたか花子が、いきなりその鍵を奪つて自分の胸へソツと抱いた。
「ねえ、この鍵、妾の肉體の鍵だわね」
そう云つて不敵な横山氏の顔を柔しく睨んでいる花子の愛くるしいそぶりに、彼はまだ見ぬ彼女の肉體の上にみだらな妄想を逞しくして眼を細めた。
二人はぴつたり寄添うて廊下の曲角まで来たとき、どすんと花子に衝突した少年があつた。それは新吉であつた。花子と新吉の衝突は今度の作戰行動の中の最も重要な部分なのであつた。
「OK、うまくいったわね――」チラリと振返つて眼にものいわす花子。
「あ、びつくりした、失敬」
新吉は精一杯におどけた顔で、ペコリと頭を下げた。
脱衣室へ入ると、さつさと上衣を脱ぎ始める花子の姿を、擽ったい氣持でチラリチラリと盗み見ている横山氏。
花子はブラウスもスカートも脱いで、はやシミーズも脱ぎにかかつた。さすが年輩の横山氏もうずくような官能をゆすぶられた。
裸になつた花子は牝鹿のように身をひるがえして湯槽の中へ飛び込んだ。
「あ、良い氣持！」
湯の中へ白い裸身を沈めて、花子はうつとりと眼を閉じた。
――今頃は新ちゃんが、うまくやつてくれているだろう、可哀想に此の豚め、何んにも知らずにのぼせているわ――花子は得意であった。
「おい、こつちへ寄つたらどうだい」興奮の高鳴りに、耐え切れなくなつた横山氏、いきなり花子の肩を抱こうとした。
「あら、よしてよ、凄くあいやよ」
花子は彼の手をついと拂いのけた。
「だつてえ、室へ歸つてから、ゆっくり……ね、おぢさん」
花子はあまえるように彼を柔しく睨む。
「おぢさん、は、よせよ」
照れかくしに頭をかく横山氏、さすがに野獸のような振舞はしなかつた。

「今晩は、おじさん」
思いがけなく馴れ馴れしい呼び声にびっくりした彼が、振り返ってみると、そこには花なら咲いたばかり、十八九歳の美しい洋装の娘が、可愛らしい口元に、にっと微笑を浮かべて立っているではないか。
「はあ、これが今流行のパンパンガールという奴かな――」と思って、彼は一寸好奇心に駆られた。彼が微笑を返すと、娘はいきなり自分の右腕を彼の左腕へ絡ませた。二人はそのまま、近くの横町へ入った。
「いくら要るんだね」
「三枚と言いたいんだけど……飛び切り勉強の一枚でいいわよ」
「ホウ、それで……」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Good evening, Uncle."
He, surprised by the unexpectedly familiar calling voice, when he looked back, there a flower if it was just bloomed, eighteen-nineteen beautiful Western-dressed girl, at a cute mouth-area, with a grin smile floating was standing, was she not?
"Ha, this is the now-popular Pan-pan girl-called thing, I wonder—" thinking, he was a bit curiosity-driven. When he returned a smile, the girl suddenly his right arm to his left arm entangled. The two people just like that, into a nearby side-street entered.
"How much is needed?"
"Three sheets I want to say, but... extra-special discount's one sheet is fine."
"Ho, with that..."
—Shall I try one experience?— so Mr. Yokoyama thought.
"Look, at that hotel, okay, come on let's go, Customer."
The girl, as if pulling him, steadily walks.
—It seems the mark is a top-grade mark, from now it will become interesting— the girl "kukuku" inside her mouth laughed. That girl was Hanako.
When entering the hotel, Hanako did the room negotiation. The two were guided to a room with the number 7 attached. There was a room where a double bed of about ten-tatami size was tightly and grandly installed.
"You still look like a young lady, but why are you doing this kind of thing?"
Mr. Yokoyama put his portfolio on the bed, sat there, and holding Hanako's hand, asked.
"Don't ask such unrefined things. More than that, you, won't you enter the bath? It feels good, very."
Hanako, as if flirting, laughed, and explains that although this hotel has no rooms with baths, there is a 'family bath' where one can calmly enter.

(Omitted)

There, the two decided to enter that bath together, and upon leaving the room, Mr. Yokoyama, as if remembering, locked the door.
"No, it's a world where one cannot be careless for even a moment."
He was remembering the 50,000 yen bundle of bills inside the portfolio. When he tried to put that key in his pocket, thinking what she might, Hanako suddenly snatched that key and softly to her chest hugged it.
"Hey, this key, it's the key to my physical body, isn't it?"
To the adorable behavior of Hanako who said so and was gently glaring at the fearless Mr. Yokoyama's face, he made lewd delusions strong upon her not-yet-seen body and narrowed his eyes.
When the two closely snuggling came to the corridor's corner, there was a boy who collided with a thud against Hanako. That was Shinkichi. The collision between Hanako and Shinkichi was the most important part of this time's battle action.
"OK, it went well—" Hanako, glancing back, let her eyes speak.
"Ah, I was surprised, pardon me."
Shinkichi, with a maximum playful face, "pekori" bowed his head.
Entering the dressing room, Mr. Yokoyama was stealing glances with a ticklish feeling at the figure of Hanako who quickly began taking off her coat.
Hanako took off her blouse and skirt, and already began taking off her chemise. As expected, even the elderly Mr. Yokoyama's aching sensuality was shaken.
Hanako, who became naked, like a doe flipped her body and jumped into the bathtub.
"Ah, feels good!"
Sinking her white naked body into the hot water, Hanako trancelike closed her eyes.
—By now Shin-chan is probably doing it well. Pitifully, this pig-man, without knowing anything is infatuated— Hanako was in high spirits.
"Hey, why don't you come over here?" Mr. Yokoyama, becoming unable to endure the throbbing of excitement, suddenly tried to embrace Hanako's shoulder.
"Oh, stop it, I really dislike it."
Hanako lightly brushed away his hand.
"Because, after returning to the room, slowly... right, Uncle?"
Hanako sweet-talkingly glares at him gently.
"'Uncle,' stop that."
Mr. Yokoyama, scratching his head to hide his embarrassment, as expected did not do beast-like behavior.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

"Good evening, Mister."
Startled by the unexpectedly familiar greeting, the man turned around to find a young woman who looked like a flower in full bloom. She appeared to be about eighteen or nineteen, dressed in stylish Western clothes, standing there with a charming grin.
*Is this one of those "Pan-pan girls" everyone’s talking about?* he wondered, his curiosity piqued. When he smiled back, she immediately linked her arm through his. Without a word, the pair slipped into a nearby side street.
"How much?" he asked.
"I'd usually say three bills... but I’ll give you a special discount. Just one will do."
"Oho, is that so?" 
*Maybe I'll give this a try,* Mr. Yokoyama thought.
"Look, over at that hotel. Come on, let's go, 'Customer'!"
The girl practically dragged him along. 
*Looks like I’ve hooked a prime catch. This is where the fun starts,* she chuckled to herself. Her name was Hanako.
At the hotel, Hanako handled the check-in. They were shown to Room 7, a space of about ten tatami mats dominated by a large double bed. 
"You look like a decent young lady. Why are you doing this sort of work?" Mr. Yokoyama asked, setting his briefcase on the bed and taking her hand as he sat down.
"Don't ask such killjoy questions. More importantly, wouldn't you like a bath? It feels wonderful." Hanako gave him a flirtatious smile and explained that while the rooms didn't have private baths, the hotel had a "family bath" where they could relax together.

(...)

The two headed for the bath. As they left the room, Yokoyama remembered to lock the door. 
"Can't be too careful these days," he muttered, thinking of the fifty thousand yen in cash tucked inside his briefcase. As he moved to put the key in his pocket, Hanako suddenly snatched it and pressed it against her bosom.
"You know... this key is the key to my body," she purred.
Staring into her mischievous eyes and seeing her adorable pout, Yokoyama’s mind began to race with lewd fantasies about the body he had yet to see. 
As they walked closely together toward the end of the corridor, a boy suddenly collided with Hanako with a heavy thud. It was Shinkichi. This "accident" was actually the most crucial part of their plan.
*OK, it's done,* Hanako signaled with a quick, knowing glance back at the boy.
"Oh! Sorry about that! My mistake!" Shinkichi apologized with a comical, exaggerated bow.
Once in the dressing room, Yokoyama couldn't help but steal glances at Hanako as she began to undress. When she shed her blouse and skirt and started on her chemise, even a man of his years felt a surge of raw desire.
Now completely naked, Hanako leaped into the tub with the grace of a doe.
"Ah, this feels amazing!" she sighed, closing her eyes as she sank into the hot water.
*Shin-chan should be finishing the job right about now. Poor pig... he has no idea what’s happening, he’s so infatuated,* Hanako gloated inwardly.
"Hey, why don't you come closer?" Unable to restrain himself any longer, Yokoyama reached out to grab her shoulder.
"Oh, stop it! I really don't like that!" Hanako brushed his hand away. "Wait until we’re back in the room... then we can take our time. Right, 'Mister'?"
She gave him a sweet, playful look.
"Stop calling me 'Mister,'" Yokoyama muttered, scratching his head in embarrassment. Despite his urges, he didn't try to force himself on her.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is formatted in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), reading from right to left.
*   **Typography:** The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century printing. It uses some older kana forms (e.g., `おぢさん` for `おじさん`, `からませた` with small `つ` not always distinguished).
*   **Illustration:** A large, hand-drawn illustration occupies the center-right of the page. It depicts a partially nude woman (Hanako) in a traditional wooden bathtub (*furo*). The style is typical of Showa-era "ero-guro" or pulp illustrations—suggestive but not quite explicit by modern standards.
*   **Structure:** The narrative follows a classic "short story" format found in entertainment magazines. The dialogue is punctuated with traditional Japanese quotation marks (`「 」`).
*   **Pagination:** A small "11" is visible at the bottom center, indicating the page number.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The text wraps around the illustration, creating a dynamic flow that draws the reader's eye toward the provocative image while they read the narrative.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII Showa):** The mention of "Pan-pan girls" (*panpan-gāru*) explicitly places this in the immediate post-war era (late 1940s to early 1950s). These were women who engaged in prostitution, often catering to Allied occupation forces or wealthy locals.
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** This page is almost certainly from a "Kasutori" magazine. Named after a cheap, dregs-based shochu, these magazines were low-quality, inexpensive publications that thrived on "3S" (Screen, Sport, Sex) content.
*   **The Honey Trap:** The story depicts a "Mitsu-no-wana" (honey trap). While the man thinks he is buying an erotic experience, Hanako and her accomplice (Shinkichi) are actually robbing him. 
*   **Currency & Economy:** 50,000 yen (*goman-en*) was a significant amount of money in the late 1940s, suggesting Mr. Yokoyama is a wealthy businessman (a "kamo" or easy mark).
*   **Bath Culture:** The "family bath" (*kazoku-buro*) in a hotel was a common setting for romantic or illicit encounters in Japanese fiction of this era.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **おぢさん (Oji-san):** An older spelling of *ojisan*. Used here as a flirtatious way for a young woman to address an older man.
*   **パンパンガール (Pan-pan girl):** A term for street-walking prostitutes in post-war Japan.
*   **飛切勉強 (Tobikiri benkyō):** *Benkyō* (study) is used here in its merchant slang sense of "discount." *Tobikiri* means "extraordinary." She is offering a "huge discount."
*   **カモ (Kamo):** Literally "duck." Slang for a "mark," a "sucker," or an easy target for a scam.
*   **上カモ (Ue-kamo):** A "top-grade" mark; someone with a lot of money to steal.
*   **シミーズ (Shimīzu):** From the French *chemise*. A standard piece of women's lingerie at the time.
*   **折鞄 (Oribagan/Orikaban):** A type of folding briefcase or portfolio.
*   **野暮 (Yabo):** Unrefined, tactless, or "uncool."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Deception vs. Desire:** The central theme is the man’s physical desire blinding him to the obvious red flags of a criminal plot. His "lewd fantasies" make him vulnerable.
*   **Economic Survival:** Underneath the eroticism is the subtext of post-war survival. Hanako and Shinkichi are likely orphans or desperate youths using their wits (and Hanako's beauty) to survive by preying on the "fat cats" of the era.
*   **The Male Gaze:** The narrative and the illustration are designed specifically for a male audience, focusing on the act of "stealing glances" and the descriptions of the woman's body.
*   **Class Conflict:** The wealthy Mr. Yokoyama, referred to with the respectful *-shi*, is mocked by the narrative as a "pig" (*buta-me*) by the lower-class Hanako.
