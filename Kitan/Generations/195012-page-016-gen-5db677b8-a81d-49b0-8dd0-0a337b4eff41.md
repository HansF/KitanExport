**夫のある職業婦人が如何にし**

「同業者の総会」なんて、サツキを連れ出す口実に過ぎない。
サツキがどんな術で社長を御（ぎよ）すかしらないが、究極は男と女だ。暴力（ちから）をふるわれれば、それまでだ。
いよいよ今夜こそ、ヒヒの正体をあらわし、サツキにいどみかゝるのだ。珠玉のように磨いてきたサツキの肌を、ヒヒに汚されてたまるものか、私は大阪駅へ急行した。
武田尾駅へ来ると、黎明ホテルは一流の旅館なので、すぐ判つた。避暑の時期もすんだころとて、部屋は空いていた。
私は早速、サツキに私の来ていることを知らせてやろうと、あまり呑めないビールをのみながら女中をひき止めて乏しい財布から、チップをはりこみ、私の来ていることを、そつとサツキに傅（つた）えて貰つた。
十時、十一時、私は今にサツキが、悲鳴をあげて逃げこんでくるだろうと、待ち構えていた。が、十二時近くなつても現れないので、少し心配になり、彼等の部屋へ押し かけてみようかと思つていたとき、ノックの音がした。扉をあけてみると、ホテルのパジャマに着替えたサツキが、湯上りの化粧も濃く、匂（にお）うばかりに奇麗になつてニヤニヤ笑いながら立っていた。
「あなた、ご心配かけてすみません」
ひどく落着いているので私はしらさか見当がはずれ、ポカンとしていた。
「あなた、お風呂まだでしょ。一風呂浴びていらっしゃい」
「社長は？」
「大丈夫よ。細工は（りゅうりゅう）、安心なさい。温泉場へ来るなんて、新婚以来初めてね、今夜はゆっくり温泉情緒にひたりましょうよ」
私は全く狐につままれたようで、訳が判らなかったが、それ以上聞いてもサツキは笑うばかりで答えないので訳の判らないまま安心して風呂場へ下りて行った。
「こうしていると、新婚旅行の時のことを思い出すわね、ウフフフ……」
流しのギターの音をききながら、私達は甘い昔の思い出にふけっていた。私は膝をくずして座っているサツキを改めて見た。
あの頃より脂肪がのり、ゴムマリのようにはずんでいる双つのふくらみ、腹から腰へのなやましい曲線。
翌朝、朝食をとつていると、
「奥さん、おはよう」
どぎつい化粧をしたけばけばしい女が入つて来た。サツキは女を見ると、束の二千圓」
と、女に差出した。
「あのオヤジつたら、いい年をして、とってもひつこくて、粘っこくて、私、疲れてしまったわ」
女は金を受取りながら、ブツ／＼こぼした。
「じゃ、もう五百円増すわ」
「どうも、すみません」
女は金をハンドバッグに仕舞うと、
「奥さん、またどうぞ、バイバイ」
と、蓮ッ葉な言葉を残して、部屋を出て行った。
「ありゃ、なんだい」
私がおどろいていると、
「パンパンよ。あたしの身代りよ」
「エエッ？」
いざというときになつて、真暗がりを利用して、サツキとパンパンが入れ替つたのだと説明されてそうだつたのかと、私はようやく合点がいって高笑いした。
「あなたも社長もお目ざめの頃ですが、一番機嫌お伺いしてくるわ」
そういつてサツキは出て行つたが間もなく、クスクス忍び笑いして帰つて来た。
「あなた、社長とてもご満足の態（てい）で帰つていつたわ。これ、出張料の一万圓よ」
「お前、なかなかすじいんだね」
「これで二三日逗留（とうりゅう）しましょうよ」
「ウン、小説の種が出来たよ。早速仕事にかかろう」
「なんて題？」
「小説の種になった社長」
「オホホホ……」
「アハハハ……」
静かな湯の町の朝だつた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**How a Married Working Woman [Did Something]**

"Industry association general meeting" etc. is nothing more than an excuse to take Satsuki out.
I do not know by what art Satsuki manages the President, but in the end, it is man and woman. If force is used, it's the end.
Finally, tonight of all nights, [he will] reveal [his] baboon-like true self and challenge Satsuki. Satsuki's skin, polished like a gem—to allow it to be defiled by a baboon? I hurried to Osaka Station.
Arriving at Takedao Station, because the Reimei Hotel is a first-class inn, it was immediately understood. Since it was the time when the summering season had ended, rooms were empty.
I immediately, wanting to let Satsuki know that I am here, while drinking beer I cannot drink much, held back the maid and from [my] scarce wallet, put in a tip, and had [her] softly convey to Satsuki that I am here.
Ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, I was waiting, thinking Satsuki would surely soon come running in screaming. But, since she did not appear even as twelve o'clock neared, I became a little worried, and just as I thought I might push into their room, there was the sound of a knock. When I opened the door, Satsuki, changed into hotel pajamas, bath-finished makeup thick, beautiful to the point of fragrance, stood grinning.
"Darling, sorry for making you worry."
Because she was terribly calm, my guess was missed, and I was blank.
"Darling, you haven't had a bath yet, have you. Go have a bath."
"The President?"
"It is okay. The craftsmanship is flourishing (all set), please be at ease. To come to a hot spring resort, it's the first time since the honeymoon, isn't it? Tonight, let's slowly soak in the hot spring mood."
I was completely like being possessed by a fox (bewildered), and did not understand the reason, but even if I asked more Satsuki only laughed and did not answer, so not knowing the reason I went down to the bath in relief.
"Doing this, it brings back memories of our honeymoon, doesn't it, ufufufu..."
While listening to the sound of a wandering guitar, we were indulging in sweet old memories. I looked anew at Satsuki who was sitting with knees relaxed.
More fat on her than that time, two swellings bouncing like rubber balls, the distressing curves from belly to waist.
The next morning, while having breakfast,
"Madam, good morning."
A gaudy woman with heavy makeup came in. Satsuki, seeing the woman, "The bundle of two thousand yen,"
and held it out to the woman.
"That old man, despite his age, was very persistent and sticky, I'm exhausted."
The woman, while receiving the money, grumbled.
"Well then, I'll add another five hundred yen."
"Thank you very much."
The woman, putting the money into her handbag,
"Madam, come again, bye-bye,"
and leaving behind harlot-like words, left the room.
"What's that?"
When I was surprised,
"It's a Panpan (streetwalker). My substitute."
"Eh?"
When the moment came, utilizing the pitch darkness, Satsuki and the Panpan switched—being explained thus, "Is that so," I finally understood and laughed loudly.
"It is about time you and the President woke up, but I'll go pay my respects first."
Saying so Satsuki went out, but soon, she returned chuckling secretly.
"Darling, the President went home looking very satisfied. This is the ten thousand yen 'business trip fee'."
"You, you're quite something/shrewd."
"Let's stay here for two or three days with this."
"Yeah, a seed for a novel has been made. Let's get to work immediately."
"What title?"
"The President who became the seed of a novel."
"Ohohoho..."
"Ahahaha..."
It was a morning in a quiet hot spring town.

**The Schemes of a Married Career Woman**

The so-called "industry convention" was nothing but a flimsy excuse for the President to spirit Satsuki away. I don't know what feminine wiles Satsuki uses to keep him at bay, but ultimately, they are just a man and a woman. If he decides to use force, it's all over. I knew that tonight, that old lecher would finally drop the act and pounce on her. I couldn't stand the thought of Satsuki’s porcelain skin being defiled by that baboon, so I rushed to Osaka Station.

Upon arriving at Takedao Station, I easily found the Reimei Hotel; it was a top-tier establishment. The summer rush was over, so I had no trouble getting a room. Anxious to let Satsuki know I was nearby, I nursed a beer I didn't really want, tipped the maid generously from my meager savings, and had her secretly deliver a message to Satsuki.

Ten o’clock passed, then eleven. I waited on edge, expecting Satsuki to come bursting in at any moment, screaming for help. By midnight, when she still hadn't appeared, I was sick with worry. Just as I was about to storm their room, there was a knock at my door. I opened it to find Satsuki standing there in hotel pajamas. Her post-bath makeup was heavy, and she looked radiantly beautiful, a mischievous grin on her face.

"I'm sorry I made you worry, dear," she said. She was so composed that I was completely taken aback.
"You haven't bathed yet, have you? Go on, have a soak," she urged.
"What about the President?" I stammered.
"Everything's under control. Don't you worry. It’s been ages since we’ve been to a hot spring—not since our honeymoon. Let's just enjoy the atmosphere tonight."

I felt like I’d been cast in a spell, but since Satsuki wouldn't give me a straight answer, I went down to the baths, my mind reeling but my heart somewhat eased.

"Being here like this... it really does feel like our honeymoon again, doesn't it? Hehehe..."
As the faint strumming of a wandering guitarist drifted in, we lost ourselves in sweet memories. I looked at Satsuki as she sat there, relaxed. She was fuller now than she had been back then—her curves were more pronounced, her body ripe and supple.

The next morning, as we were eating breakfast, a gaudily dressed woman with heavy, garish makeup sauntered in. "Morning, Ma'am," she chirped. 
Without a word, Satsuki handed her a bundle of two thousand yen.
"That old geezer... for a man his age, he was incredibly persistent. I'm wiped out," the woman complained as she took the money.
"Here, I'll add another five hundred for your trouble," Satsuki said.
"Thanks a million! See you around, Ma'am. Bye-bye!" With those brash words, she vanished from the room.

"What on earth was that?" I asked, stunned.
"A *Panpan* girl," Satsuki explained. "She was my body double."
"What?!"
She explained that when the lights went out, she had swapped places with the streetwalker in the pitch blackness. I finally understood the trick and burst into laughter. 
"It's about time the President woke up. I'll go pay my respects," Satsuki said. She returned a few minutes later, stifling a giggle.
"He went home looking like the cat who got the cream. And look—he gave me ten thousand yen as a 'business trip allowance'."
"You're amazing, Satsuki. Truly."
"Let's use this to stay a few more days."
"Right. And I’ve got the perfect idea for a new story. I'm going to start writing immediately."
"What’s the title?"
"The President Who Became a Plot Point."
"Ohohoho!"
"Ahahaha!"
It was a beautiful, quiet morning in the hot spring town.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout & Typography:** The page uses a standard vertical layout (right-to-left). The title is set in a large, stylized red font to grab attention. The main text is in a standard serif typeface typical of mid-century Japanese printing.
*   **Visual Elements:** A red decorative border frames the text, a common feature in popular "Kasutori" magazines to suggest excitement or scandal. The illustration is in a "Heta-uma" (bad-but-good) or early manga style, depicting a sophisticated woman in Western dress (indicative of the "moga" or modern girl influence lingering into the post-war era).
*   **Hierarchy:** The title acts as a sensational hook. The story is a "one-shot" short fiction piece. The use of red ink for the title and the border suggests a low-cost, high-volume publication designed for entertainment (pulp fiction).
*   **Punctuation:** Includes standard Japanese punctuation, with the addition of "double-slashes" (//) often used in pulp formatting for emphasis or rhythm, and the "long dash" for the ending.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-WWII Japan):** The mention of "2,000 yen" and "10,000 yen" as significant sums, combined with the term "Panpan," places this firmly in the late 1940s to early 1950s. This was a period of extreme economic hardship and shifting moral boundaries.
*   **Panpan (パンパン):** This was the slang term for Japanese streetwalkers who catered primarily to American GIs during the Occupation, but also to Japanese men. In the context of this story, Satsuki uses one to protect her "purity" while still "servicing" her boss through a proxy.
*   **The "Shachō" (President) and "Shokugyō Fujin" (Working Woman):** The story reflects the power dynamics of the era. The "President" expects sexual favors as part of a business trip, a common trope in "salaryman" noir or pulp stories. The "Working Woman" (Satsuki) is depicted as clever and resourceful, using the "system" (the availability of Panpan girls) to outwit her predatory boss.
*   **Hot Spring (Onsen) Culture:** The setting of Takedao (a real hot spring area near Osaka) provides a classic "getaway" backdrop for illicit or clandestine encounters.
*   **Kasutori Magazines:** Named after a low-quality dregs-based shochu, these magazines were cheap, printed on poor paper, and filled with "3-S" content (Sex, Screen, Sports). They flourished during the Occupation.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **細工は流々 (Saiku wa ryūryū):** An idiom meaning "the plan is well-laid" or "the preparations are going smoothly." It suggests Satsuki has meticulously orchestrated the deception.
*   **蓮ッ葉 (Hasuppa):** A term for a woman who is flippant, brazen, or coarse in speech/manner, often used to describe prostitutes or "low-class" women of the era.
*   **合点がいって (Gatten ga itte):** To finally understand or "get" something.
*   **身代り (Migawari):** Substitute or scapegoat. In this case, a literal body double.
*   **ヒヒ (Hihi):** Literally "baboon," but used metaphorically to describe a lecherous, ugly old man.
*   **出張料 (Shutchō-ryō):** Business trip allowance/fee. Here, it is used euphemistically for the money the President paid Satsuki for what he thought was a night of sex.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Deception as Empowerment:** Satsuki is not a victim. She uses the President's own lust and the darkness of the room to trick him. She maintains her "virtue" (in the eyes of her husband/narrator) while successfully extracting a large sum of money from her employer.
*   **The Complicit Husband:** The narrator is not angry at Satsuki for being in this situation; instead, he is a co-conspirator. He sees the event as "material" (seeds) for his writing, reflecting a somewhat bohemian or nihilistic post-war literary attitude.
*   **Economic Morality:** The story treats the hiring of a prostitute (Panpan) as a practical business transaction. The moral focus is not on the act of prostitution itself, but on the cleverness of outwitting the "baboon-like" boss.
*   **Post-War Survival:** The characters are focused on money (the 10,000 yen "bonus"). The "happy ending" is defined by financial gain and a clever joke at the expense of authority.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Short Fiction (Pulp/Sensationalist)
*   **Genre:** Kasutori-style Drama, Satire, Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense (Ero-Guro-Nansensu) influence.
*   **Tags:** Post-war Japan, Panpan girls, Marital trickery, Corporate satire, Hot spring setting, Gender dynamics.
