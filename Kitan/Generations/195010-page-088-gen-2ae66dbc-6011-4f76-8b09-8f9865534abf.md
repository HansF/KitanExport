初秋の柔かい日ざしが、快よく絵日
傘を通して、ゆきの襟筋[えりすじ]をとろりと暖

彼岸花の咲き乱れる長堀[ながほり]の河筋を、
コロリ／＼と木履[きぼり]を鳴らせて行くゆき
の後姿は美しくも又あどけない娘らし
い優しさを、あたりにまき散らしてい
た。姊[あね]ごのめかがその後[うしろ]から、ドシリ
／＼と重たげに、大きな腰をプリ／＼
振って、娘はん大事と附隨うのも、微
笑ましい、この島の内界隈のなごやか
な風情であった。

道行く人々は一様に振返つて、あれ
が浪花で一二を争う材木問屋で、木津
屋はんの箱入娘――はつさい（お侠[おだて]）
のおゆきさんやがなと、眼交ぜ袖引き合
つてのリソ～声。ヘーンなんとお
顔でな。なんと大したもんやおまへん
か、と耳にチラ～入る噂もどこ吹く
風と、クル～と傘を廻してわき見も
せず、憂いを含んだきれ長の瞼はさつ

とし込めて、心持ち顔を右に傾けてい

初秋の柔らかい日差しが、心地よく絵日傘を通して、ゆきの襟足をさらりと温める――。
彼岸花の咲き乱れる長堀の川沿いを、コロリンコロリンと木履（下駄）を鳴らして歩くゆきの後ろ姿は、美しくもまたあどけない娘らしい優しさを、辺りに振りまいていた。姐御（あねご）の「めか」がその後ろから、ドッシリドッシリと重たげに、大きな腰をプリプリ振って、「お嬢様が一番大事」と付き従うのも、微笑ましい。この島の内界隈の和やかな風情であった。

道行く人々は一様に振り返って、「あれが浪花で一、二を争う材木問屋、木津屋の箱入り娘――お転婆（おきゃん）のおゆきさんじゃないか」と、目配せし袖を引き合ってひそひそ話す。
「へぇ、なんて綺麗なお顔で。たいしたもんじゃないか」と耳にちらちら入る噂もどこ吹く風と、クルクルと傘を回して脇見もせず、憂いを含んだ切れ長のまぶたはすっと前を向いたまま。富士額の眉をちらりと潜め、心持ち顔を右に傾けている様子は、コロリカラリと、人目を臆せぬ心憎いまでに落ち着き払った物腰である。

それがなおさらに巾着切りのゴンタ安の胸をじりじりさせるのである。かれこれ三丁ほども密かに後を追って機会を窺っているのに、全く隙がない。「娘一人」と侮って、あっさり片付けようと思ったのに、少し当てが外れてゴンタ安はじりじりしていた。乱れた刷毛先に赤とんぼがスッと止まって疲れを休める。

「チェッ。トンボまで俺を馬鹿にしていやがる。狙ったら外れっこない俺の腕も、ちょっと鈍ったのかな。厄介な頼まれ仕事だぜ、こいつは……」
ぶつぶつ呟いて、とうとう三休橋のたもとまで来てしまった。というのも、勝気で男嫌い、男の顔を見るのも吐き気がするというゆきの激しい気性が、つい先日も道頓堀の中座の前で、故意にドシンと突き当たってきた男の出鼻をくじいたのだった。

男はゴンタ安の舎弟（兄弟分）で「三下り半の傅次」と言い、これで女房を八回も取り替えたという因縁つきのうるさい奴。ドスンと当たった拍子に彼の手が素早くゆきの頭に伸びていた。かんざしを抜き取ろうとした瞬間、ゆきはハッとして身を引いた。もう一秒遅ければ……。

Early autumn's soft sunlight, comfortably through the picture-parasol, Yuki's neck-line meltingly warms—.
Along the Nagahori riverbank where spider lilies bloom in profusion, *korori-korori* making the wooden clogs sound, the going Yuki's back-view was beautiful and also innocent girl-like gentleness, in the surroundings scattering was.
The "Ane-go" (older sister/maid) Meka from behind that, *doshiri-doshiri* heavily, big hips *puri-puri* shaking, "Young lady is important" thus following along also, was a smiling, in this Shimanouchi neighborhood a peaceful atmosphere was.

The people going on the road uniformly looking back, "That is in Naniwa first or second competing timber wholesaler, Kitsuya's sheltered daughter—eighteen (tomboyish) O-Yuki-san is it not," thus eye-exchanging sleeve-pulling-each-other's whispering voices. "Heh, what a face.

**The Servant Koman: A Chivalrous Lady's Journey**

**Written by En Takehiko**
**Illustrated by Sumaishi Shuyuki**

(I)
The gentle sunlight of early autumn filtered pleasantly through a painted paper parasol, casting a warm glow over Yuki’s neck. As she strolled along the Nagahori canal, where spider lilies bloomed in wild profusion, the rhythmic *clack-clack* of her wooden sandals echoed behind her. Yuki’s silhouette exuded a delicate, innocent grace that seemed to brighten the very air around her. Following closely behind was Meka, her stout companion, whose heavy hips swayed with every purposeful step. Meka’s protective devotion to the "young lady" was a familiar and heartwarming sight, adding to the tranquil atmosphere of the Shimanouchi district.

Passersby couldn't help but turn their heads. "Look, isn't that O-Yuki? The sheltered daughter of Kitsuya, one of the greatest timber merchants in all of Osaka—the one they call the 'spirited belle'?" they whispered, nudging one another with knowing glances. Yuki, however, remained indifferent to the rumors drifting past her ears. Twirling her parasol, she gazed straight ahead, her long, elegant eyes tinged with a faint shadow of melancholy. Beneath her perfectly shaped "Mt. Fuji" hairline, her brow was slightly knit, her head tilted just a fraction to the right. Her composure was almost unnerving; she moved with a confidence that suggested she was utterly unfazed by the public gaze.

This poise only served to further irritate Gonta-yasu, a local pickpocket. He had been tailing her for nearly three blocks, waiting for an opening that never came. He had underestimated her, thinking a lone girl would be an easy mark, but his expectations were proving false. He paced nearby, his frustration mounting like the heat of the day. A red dragonfly landed softly on the stray bristles of a discarded brush, taking a moment's rest while Gonta-yasu fumed.

"Damn it," he hissed. "Even the dragonflies are mocking me. Has my touch gone dull? I never miss my mark. This 'favor' I'm doing is turning into a real headache."
Muttering to himself, he finally reached the foot of the Sankyu Bridge. He recalled her reputation: fierce, man-hating, and prone to outbursts of temper. Just a few days prior, in front of the Nakaza Theater in Dotonbori, she had humiliated a man who had deliberately tried to bump into her. 

That man had been Gonta-yasu's own sworn brother, a troublesome rogue known as "Eight-Divorce Fukuji." Fukuji had lunged for her hair at the moment of impact, his hand darting toward her head to snatch her hairpin. But in a flash, Yuki had recoiled. If she had been even a second slower...

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis
The layout is characteristic of Japanese "pulp" or *kasutori* magazines from the mid-20th century.

*   **Illustration:** The dominant feature is a semi-nude illustration of a woman (presumably Koman or Yuki) from the back. She is portrayed in an Edo-period aesthetic, holding a parasol, with men watching her from a lattice window (suggesting a red-light district or a scene of public voyeurism). The line work is expressive, blending traditional *ukiyo-e* influences with modern erotic illustration styles.
*   **Typography:** The title uses bold, stylized brush calligraphy (*kantei-ryu* or similar theater-style fonts) to evoke an Edo-period feel. The main body text is set in a standard vertical orientation with *furigana* (reading aids) provided for difficult kanji and names, indicating a broad readership.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title and illustration take precedence, designed to grab the reader's attention immediately. The text is divided into columns below the artwork, with the chapter number (一) clearly marked.
*   **Numbering:** The page number "( 88 )" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is part of a longer serial or anthology.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context
*   **Era (Post-war 1950s):** The content and style point toward the "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense) lineage that flourished in post-war Japan. These magazines offered a mix of titillation, historical fiction, and social commentary.
*   **Setting (Edo Period Osaka):** The story is set in the Edo period, specifically in the Shimanouchi and Dotonbori districts of Osaka (Naniwa). References to "timber wholesalers" (材木問屋) and "Naka-za" (a famous theater) ground the fiction in historical geography.
*   **Onnadate (女侠):** This refers to a "chivalrous woman," a female counterpart to the *otokodate*—urban vigilantes or street knights of the Edo period who stood up for the common people against oppressive samurai or criminals.
*   **Yatsu no Koman (奴の小萬):** A legendary figure in Japanese fiction and kabuki, often depicted as a strong, independent woman with tattoos (servant status, but noble of heart).
*   **Fuji-bitai (富士額):** A hairline that forms a peak in the center of the forehead, resembling the shape of Mt. Fuji, considered a mark of traditional Japanese beauty.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes
*   **お侠 (O-kya/O-date):** Usually read *okyan*, meaning a tomboyish, spirited, or cheeky young woman. The furigana here says *odate*, which can mean "flattery" but in this context refers to her spirited nature.
*   **巾着切り (Kinchaku-kiri):** Literally "purse cutter," the historical term for a pickpocket.
*   **三下り半 (Mikudari-han):** Literally "three and a half lines," referring to a standard letter of divorce in the Edo period. Here, it is used as a nickname for a man who has been divorced many times.
*   **長堀 (Nagahori):** A major canal in Osaka (reclaimed in the 1960s) that was a hub of commerce.
*   **曰く因縁 (Iwaku-innen):** A set phrase meaning "a complicated history" or "a past with many stories behind it."

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext
*   **Voyeurism and Eroticism:** The primary draw is the visual and textual depiction of a woman in a state of partial undress in public. The text emphasizes the "men's eyes" following her, making the reader a participant in the voyeurism.
*   **The "Strong Woman" Trope:** Yuki is portrayed as fierce and "man-hating," defying the submissive feminine ideal. This creates a tension between her beauty and her dangerous personality, a common theme in *onnadate* stories.
*   **Class and Urban Life:** The contrast between the wealthy timber merchant's daughter and the low-life pickpockets of the Osaka underworld creates a classic "high-low" drama.
*   **Nostalgia:** Writing about the Edo period in the 1950s served as a form of escapism and a way to explore themes of sexuality and honor that were being redefined in post-war Japan.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags
*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serialized Novel, Period Drama (*Jidaigeki*).
*   **Tags:** Erotica, Edo Period, Osaka, Chivalry (*Ninkyo*), Pickpocket, Strong Female Lead, Pulp Fiction.
