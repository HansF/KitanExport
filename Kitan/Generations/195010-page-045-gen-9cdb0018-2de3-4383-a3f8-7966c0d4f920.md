**本牧夜話　色道女鑑**

「あたいが許してやるからね、そして、その夜は、あたいのところで奥様がおやすみになって下さったのよお」
「うへえッ、すると、あの夜の――てへッ、指輪も――」
エカンが眼を白黒して恐れ入った。
「そうだったか、これで、すっかりもやもやがとれた――すると、エカンが犯人だ」
そういつて、ドラは、始めて呼吸を吹きかえしたような顔をした。
そして、キツとエカンを睨みつけて
「この大泥棒奴ッ！！　色事を手引をするだけならまだしも、奥様の、おからだまで、あまつさえ指輪まで盗むとはこの野郎！　三年の懲役だ！」
「おつと、トアン、そりゃムゴイ、あつしや、なにも知らずにやつたんですぜ、そもそも、こうなつたというのはあのムスキタのためでしよう、あいつさえ俺に頼んじやりやこんないざこざは起こりつこねえんですからなあ」
「しかし、指輪を盗んだ罪は消えねえぞ！」
すると、妻君がいつた。
「ドラ、許しておやり、第一ムスキタが悪いんだから、いずれ、うんと仕返ししてやるけど（妻君は、そういつて、意味ありげな流し眼で、ドラをみた）それに、こんな指輪もういらないバブにあげる」
バブは、膝まづいてにたにたしながら、王冠でもいただくみたいに手を差し伸べた。
と、隣りの部屋から物凄い足音がして太つちよの狸みたいな顔をした、ムスキタが憤然と現れ、ヤタラに腕を振り廻しながら
「イヤイヤイツ、エカン！　よくも俺の女房を寝とりやがつたなあッ、コナゴナにして、火吹き竹で吹いてやろうかッ！！」
つまり、ここで、一番馬鹿をみたのは、いざこざの張本人ムスキタ大人であつた。
バブを見事に射落したと思つていたところが、隣りの部屋で様子を聞いているとは、股ぐらのホクロまで知りぬいているはずの自分の妻君だつたのであり、おまけに、頼みこんでわざわざエカンのような、ど助平に大事な妻君を盗まれてしまつたわけだつた。
――（終り）――

「ハマもすっかり変つたもんさねえ」
と仇っぽく微笑むは、本牧のキヨホテルでその昔、盛名を謳われた一代のお春女史、もう三十の坂はとうくに越ぎてる筈なのに、ニュールックの着こなしも板について唇が眞紅に彩られているのを見ると、どう見ても二十代の女としか見えない。
「なにしろ、伊勢崎の裏の原つぱで、トウシロ娘が平つちやらで客をとるんだものね全く、いやになつちやうよ……昔はハマの女の仁義つてものがあつたんだけど当節じやあんなスケパンさ」
「ところで姐さんは、いま何にしてるんだい」
「わたし？いやだよ。女の生きる道なんてきまつてるじやない但しおかげさまでオンリーワンつて、一人の人だけしか相手にしない高級のあれだろう？」
「あれつて……失礼よ。オンリーワンは、つまり光輝あるセコンド奥さんよ。昔のお馴染さんが、また此方へ来てねわたしはいまの人と暮してるのハマもすっかり赤くなったもんじゃねえ」
変に誤解しないでね」
「ほゝお、そりゃお仕合せでお芽出とう。だが貴女が見ても、やつぱり近頃のハマの姉さんは、そんなに目に余る程ヒドいんですか」
「ふふふ……勇敢すぎるわよ。私なんか田舎娘でね。ヨコハマのホテルへ給仕女に行くというので黒い制服に白ナプキンを頭にのっけるつもりで出て来たら、ホテルはホテルでも、キヨホテルでねいきなり初日からお客をとらされて、前借があるのだもの、イヤとも断れず、半年ぐらいは泣きの涙で過ごしたもんだけど、今思うと、あれだけ頭が古かつたんだわね」
「いくつの時でした？」
「十七の五月、高等を出て直ぐよ、みんながモダンな所へ働きに行くつて、出世するみたいに駅迄見送つてくれた手前からも、泣き事も言つてやれず、半年、一年と経つうちに、だん／＼女度胸もついちゃつてね終戦前にはいつぱし名前が通るようになつちゃたのサ…」
「男をとる時に、天井の節穴を見て居れ、木の目を覚えておれば、一日に何人とつても疲れないつて事、本当かい」
「ほんとうよ。わたしなんか、今でこそ、身体がいうことをきかないけれどこれでも四五年前時分なら一日にこの身体で二三十人の男の御相手してたわよ。今のスケみたいにスキを出ししてたら、一晩に七八人で、身体がいうことをを、きかなくなっちゃつていたわね……」

**本牧夜話　色道女鑑（しきどうじょかん）**

「あたいが許してやるからね。そして、その夜は、あたいのところで奥様がお休みになってくださったのよ」
「うへえ、すると、あの夜の……てへっ、指輪も……」
エカンが目を白黒させて恐縮した。
「そうだったか、これで、すっかりモヤモヤが取れた。すると、エカンが犯人だ」
そう言って、ドラは、初めて呼吸を吹き返したような顔をした。
そして、きりっとエカンを睨みつけて、
「この大泥棒め！ 色事の手引きをするだけならまだしも、奥様の体まで、あまつさえ指輪まで盗むとはこの野郎！ 三年の懲役だ！」
「おっと、ドラさん、そりゃあ酷（むご）い。あっしは、何も知らずにやったんですぜ。そもそも、こうなったというのはあのムスキタのためでしょう。あいつさえ俺に頼んじゃいなけりゃ、こんな悶着は起こりっこなかったんですからなあ」
「しかし、指輪を盗んだ罪は消えないぞ！」
すると、奥様が言った。
「ドラ、許しておやり。第一ムスキタが悪いんだから。いずれ、うんと仕返ししてやるけど（奥様は、そう言って、意味ありげな流し目で、ドラを見た）。それに、こんな指輪もういらない。バブにあげる」
バブは、跪いてニタニタしながら、王冠でもいただくみたいに手を差し伸べた。
と、隣の部屋から物凄い足音がして、太っちょの狸みたいな顔をしたムスキタが憤然と現れ、やたらに腕を振り回しながら、
「いやいやいや、エカン！ よくも俺の女房を寝取りやがったな！ 粉々にして、火吹き竹で吹いてやろうか！」
つまり、ここで一番馬鹿を見たのは、騒動の張本人であるムスキタ大人（たいじん）であった。
バブを見事に射落としたと思っていたところが、隣の部屋で様子を聞いていたのは、股ぐらのホクロまで知り抜いているはずの自分の奥様だったのであり、おまけに、頼み込んでわざわざエカンのようなド助平に、大事な奥様を盗まれてしまったわけだった。

「なにしろ、伊勢佐木（町）の裏の原っぱで、素人（トウシロ）娘が平気で客を取るんだものね。全く、嫌になっちゃうよ。昔はハマの女の仁義ってもんがあったんだけど、近頃じゃあんなスケパン（パンパン）さ」
「ところで姉さんは、いま何をしてるんだい？」
「私？ いやだよ。女の生きる道なんて決まってるじゃない。但し、おかげさまでオンリーワン（米兵専属の娼婦）って、一人の人だけしか相手にしない高級なアレだろう？」

**Honmoku Night Tales: A Mirror of Women in the Way of Love**

"I am the one who forgives, you see, and that night, at my place, the Madame stayed to rest."
"Uwaa, then, that night's—he-heh, the ring too—"
Ekan rolled his eyes in astonishment.
"Was it so? With this, the fuzziness is completely cleared. Then, Ekan is the culprit."
Saying so, Dora showed a face as if breathing for the first time.
Then, glaring sharply at Ekan, 
"This big thief!! If it were only acting as a guide for love affairs it would be one thing, but to steal even the Madame's body, and moreover even the ring, you bastard! Three years of imprisonment!"
"Whoa, Tuan (Dora), that's cruel. I did it without knowing anything. In the first place, the reason it became like this is because of that Musukita, right? If only that guy hadn't asked me, this kind of trouble wouldn't have happened, after all."
"But the crime of stealing the ring won't disappear!"
Then, the wife said.
"Dora, forgive him. Because first of all Musukita is bad. Anyway, I'll give him a huge payback later (The wife said so, looking at Dora with a meaningful sidelong glance). Besides, I don't need this kind of ring anymore. I'll give it to Bab."
Bab, kneeling and grinning, reached out his hand as if receiving a crown.
Then, from the next room, a terrible sound of footsteps came, and Musukita, who had a face like a fat raccoon dog, appeared indignantly, swinging his arms around randomly.
"No, no, no, Ekan! You sure dared to steal my wife! Shall I smash you to pieces and blow you away with a fire-blowing bamboo pipe!!"
In short, here, the one who looked like the biggest fool was the ringleader of the trouble, Great Man Musukita.
Just when he thought he had successfully brought down Bab, the one listening to the situation in the next room was his own wife, who should have known even the mole on his crotch, and additionally, he had gone to the trouble of begging a super-lecher like Ekan to steal his precious wife away.
—(End)—

"The Hama (Yokohama) has completely changed, hasn't it?"
The one smiling coquettishly is the legendary Miss Oharu, who once boasted great fame at Honmoku's Kiyo Hotel. Though she should have already crossed the hill of thirty, her New Look style fits her perfectly, and seeing her lips colored in crimson, she looks like a woman in her twenties no matter how you look.
"Anyway, in the fields behind Isezaki, amateur girls are taking customers so casually; it really makes one sick... In the old days, there was something like 'honor' among the women of Hama, but nowadays it's just those sukepan (pan-pan girls)."
"By the way, Big Sis, what are you doing now?"
"Me? Oh stop it. Isn't a woman's way of living already decided? However, thanks to luck, I'm an 'Only One'—one of those high-class ones who only deals with one person, right?"
"That 'one'... how rude. An 'Only One' is, in short, a glorious 'Second Wife.' An old acquaintance came here again, you see. I'm living with that person now. Hama has also become completely 'red' (ruined/communist influence?), hasn't it. Don't misunderstand me strangely."
"Ho-ho, well that's fortunate, congratulations. But even from your eyes, are the sisters of Hama lately really so bad as to be unbearable?"
"Fufufu... they are too brave. As for me, I was a country girl, you see. They told me I'd go to a Yokohama hotel to be a waitress, so I came out intending to put a white napkin on my head over a black uniform, but even though it was a hotel, it was the Kiyo Hotel. I was made to take customers from the very first day, and since there was a cash advance, I couldn't refuse even if I hated it. I spent about half a year in tears, but thinking back now, my head was just that old-fashioned."
"How old were you then?"
"The May of my seventeenth year, right after finishing High School (Girls' School). Everyone saw me off at the station as if I were going to a modern place to work and become successful, so I couldn't even say a word of complaint. As half a year, then a year passed, I gradually gained 'womanly courage,' and before the end of the war, my name became quite well known..."
"Is it true that they say, 'When taking a man, look at the knothole in the ceiling, if you remember the grain of the wood, you won't get tired no matter how many men you take in a day'?"
"It's true. As for me, even though my body won't listen to me now, about four or five years ago, with this body, I was dealing with twenty or thirty men a day. If I showed 'suki' (vulnerability/gaps) like the girls today, with seven or eight people a night, my body would have stopped listening to me..."

**Tales of Honmoku Nights: A Chronicle of Love’s Laborers**

"I’ve forgiven him, you see. And that night, the Madame was kind enough to stay over at my place."
"Good grief! Then that night... and the ring too...?" 
Ekan’s eyes went wide with shock and embarrassment.
"So that was it. The fog has finally lifted. It was Ekan all along!" 
Dora exhaled sharply, his face looking as though he had finally remembered how to breathe. He fixed Ekan with a piercing glare. 
"You low-life thief! Playing the pimp is one thing, but to lay hands on the Madame and steal her ring to boot? You bastard! That’s three years in the clink for you!"
"Easy now, Tuan! That’s heartless! I didn’t know any better! Besides, this whole mess is Musukita’s fault. If he hadn't come crawling to me with his schemes, none of this would have happened!"
"Theft is theft, Ekan. A ring doesn't steal itself!"
At that moment, the wife spoke up. 
"Let him go, Dora. It was Musukita’s idea from the start. I’ll make sure he pays for it later, anyway." She cast a heavy, meaningful glance toward Dora. "Besides, I don’t want this ring anymore. Give it to Bab."
Bab dropped to his knees with a greasy grin, reaching out for the ring as if he were being crowned king.
Suddenly, a thunderous stomping came from the adjoining room. Musukita—a man with a face like a bloated raccoon dog—burst in, flailing his arms in a blind rage. 
"You! Ekan! You dare sleep with my wife?! I’ll grind you to dust! I’ll blow you away like ash!"
In the end, the only real fool in this comedy of errors was the mastermind himself, the "Honorable" Musukita. He thought he had successfully tricked Bab, only to realize that his own wife—who knew every inch of him, down to the last mole—had been listening in the next room the whole time. Worse yet, he had begged a degenerate like Ekan to "steal" his wife away, only to lose her for real.
—(The End)—

"Yokohama has certainly changed, hasn't it?"
The speaker was Oharu, a woman whose name once carried great weight at the Kiyo Hotel in Honmoku. She smiled with a lingering trace of her former allure. Though she was well past thirty, she wore the "New Look" with effortless grace. With her lips painted a brilliant crimson, she could easily pass for a woman in her twenties.
"Honestly, seeing these amateur girls picking up customers in the fields behind Isezaki-cho... it turns my stomach. In the old days, the women of Hama had a sense of professional honor. Nowadays, they’re all just common street-walkers."
"And what about you, Big Sis? What are you up to these days?"
"Me? Don't ask. A woman’s path in this world is usually set in stone. Though, I suppose I’m lucky. I’m an 'Only One' now—you know, the high-class kind who only sees one man."
"An 'Only One'? That’s..."
"Don't give me that look. An 'Only One' is essentially a 'Second Wife'—and a prestigious one at that. An old regular of mine came back to town, and I’m living with him now. This city has turned quite 'red' lately, hasn't it? But don't go getting the wrong idea."
"Well, I’m glad to hear you’re doing well. But tell me, from your perspective, are the girls in Hama these days really as bad as they say?"
"Fufufu... 'Brave' is the word I’d use. I was just a country girl myself. I came to Yokohama thinking I was going to be a waitress—imagined myself in a black uniform with a crisp white napkin on my head. But the 'hotel' turned out to be the Kiyo Hotel. They had me taking customers from the very first night. I had a debt to pay off, so I couldn't say no. I spent the first six months in a blur of tears. I suppose I was just naive back then."
"How old were you?"
"Seventeen. It was May, right after I finished school. Everyone at the station cheered me on like I was heading off to some grand, modern career. I couldn't bear to let them down, so I kept my mouth shut. After a year or so, I developed a thick skin. Before the war even started, I’d made quite a name for myself..."
"Is the old saying true? 'When you're with a man, just stare at a knothole in the ceiling. If you study the grain of the wood, you won't get tired, no matter how many men you see in a day'?"
"It’s absolutely true. My body doesn't work like it used to, but four or five years ago, I could handle twenty or thirty men a day. If I’d been as soft as the girls are now, seven or eight would have put me in the hospital..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The page is divided into two distinct parts. The top half and right side contain a fictional short story (a farce/comedy), while the bottom left contains an interview-style essay or "true story" narrative.
*   **Typography:** The text uses vertical orientation (tategaki), standard for Japanese publications. The font is a typical mid-century Ming-style typeface.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "本牧夜話" (Honmoku Night Tales) is set in a decorative, bold box to grab attention. 
*   **Illustration:** The central illustration bridges the two text blocks. It depicts three women in "New Look" fashion (long skirts, cinched waists), which was the height of Western fashion in the late 40s/early 50s. Their poses and expressions are somewhat cynical and worldly.
*   **Column Structure:** The text flows from right to left in traditional columns. The use of furigana (reading aids) is minimal but present for some names and specific terms.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Honmoku (Yokohama):** Following WWII, Honmoku was requisitioned by the US military (Area X). It became famous for its Americanized atmosphere, jazz clubs, and "Only One" girls.
*   **"Only One" vs. "Butterfly":** In post-war slang, an "Only One" (オンリー・ワン) was a woman who was the exclusive mistress/girlfriend of one US soldier. This was considered "higher class" than a "Butterfly," who solicited many soldiers.
*   **Pan-pan Girls:** The text mentions "Sukepan" (a variation of Pan-pan). These were street prostitutes who catered to the occupying forces.
*   **New Look (ニュールック):** Christian Dior's 1947 fashion revolution. The mention of this in the text dates the story to the late 1940s or early 1950s, showing the rapid Westernization of Japanese urban style.
*   **"Red" (赤くなった):** In the dialogue, "Hama has turned red" likely refers to the rise of communist/socialist political influence in labor unions and student movements in Yokohama during the occupation, or metaphorically to the "flushed" or "corrupted" state of the city.
*   **Kiyo Hotel (キヨホテル):** A likely fictionalized version of the real hotels in Honmoku that served as high-end brothels or "rest stations" for officers.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **色道 (Shikidō):** Literally "The Way of Sensuality." It refers to the traditions and "ethics" of the pleasure quarters.
*   **トウシロ (Tōshiro):** Slang for "amateur" (backwards version of *素人/shirouto*).
*   **姐さん (Neesan):** "Big Sister." A respectful term for a senior woman in the entertainment or sex industry.
*   **仁義 (Jingi):** A code of honor or professional ethics, usually associated with the underworld or the "demi-monde."
*   **助平 (Sukebe):** A lecher or pervert.
*   **火吹き竹 (Hifukidake):** A bamboo tube used to blow air into a charcoal fire; used here in a violent metaphor.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Post-War Disillusionment:** The contrast between the "old honor" of the pre-war era and the "brazenness" of the post-war amateur girls reflects a common sentiment of the time: that traditional values were collapsing under the pressure of poverty and occupation.
*   **The "American Dream" vs. Reality:** The story of the girl who thought she was becoming a waitress but was forced into prostitution highlights the deception and economic desperation many women faced.
*   **Survivalism:** The dialogue about "womanly courage" and the mechanical way of dealing with multiple men shows the hardened, survivalist mindset of the women in the *pan-pan* subculture.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The farce in the first half treats women as objects to be "stolen" or "won," while the second half gives a more interior, albeit cynical, look at a woman’s perspective on her own commodification.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story), Essay/Narrative (Semi-autobiographical fiction).
*   **Genre:** *Kasutori* Literature (pulp), Erudite/Social Commentary.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Yokohama/Honmoku, Occupation, Prostitution, Fashion (New Look), Gender Politics, Underworld.
