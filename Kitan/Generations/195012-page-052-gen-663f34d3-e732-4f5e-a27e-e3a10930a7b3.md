**法訣秘開打突期怠倦**

**搦め手戦術**

「へエー？　面白くないというのは、結局お互いに刺激が無くなったんですよ。いゝ事を教えてあげましょうか、姉さん？」
「いゝ事つてクックッ？」
「フ、フ、つまりね。クックッ」
テーブル越しに弟の軀が乗り出して来て、姉の耳許に口を寄せた。
「どうです？　姉さん」
やつてみませんかという風な顔付。まあ！
と呆れた姉の瞳。だが、葉子の表情の中には、小さな希望を摑んだ冒険の色が閃めいていた。
妻が倦怠期に憇々として、日夜身も痩せるほど杞憂の眉を顰めて居る時、一方、良人の俊二は至極呑気そうに、会社の書のひとゝきを同僚と雑談を交わして居る。
「君も結婚三週年の記念日が来たね。もうばつ＼／（ばつばつ）倦怠期の渦中にあるんぢやあないか」
「大丈夫だよ。僕には難関を突破するだけの信念があるんだ」
「信念か？　大きく出たな。まあそれほど自信がありや結構だ。僕ア倦怠期の時は随分ひどい目に遭ったよ、何しろ女房が秘密探偵社に頼みやがつたんで、すっかり尻ツぽを摑まれちゃつたんだよ」
「オイ君、そんな術があったのかい？　そりゃ今が聞き始めだ」
愕いて訊き直して居るところへ、同じく同僚の一人が来て、何事か俊二にぼそ＼／（ぼそぼそ）と囁いた。
「何？　僕のことをクックッ？」
「そうなんだよ」
見知らぬ男が俊二の素行に就いて、それとなく聞き合せに来て居るというのだ。然も、話の要点が女関係にあると訊いてピンときた。
「よしッ、僕が直接会つてやろう」
何を思ったのか、彼は狼狽も見せず、悠々とビルの屋上から降りて行った。

一週間経つた。
良人を送り出して間もなく、葉子は待ちに待つた、秘密探偵社からの調査報告を受け取った。封を切るのももどかしげに、タイプ印書の頁を開くと、彼女はサツと顔色を変えた。
一、蓑畑俊二ハ、最近会社内ニ於テモ風評悪ク、特ニ女性トノ交渉ガ頻々トシテ噂ニノボリ、既ニタイピスト津川絹子（二一歳）トハ肉体関係ニ迄陥ツテオリ、妊娠二ヶ月。二人ガトイレットデ接吻ヲシテイルトコロヲ発見サレ、問題ヲ引起シツツアル。
一、蓑畑俊二ハ、難波附近ノカフヱー界ニ足繁ク出入シ酒場「クララ」ノ女給小百合コト井上廣子（二十三歳）ト深ク馴染ミ、指輪、ドレス、靴等カナリノ金品ヲ興エテ再三ホテル旅館ニ誘イ、妊娠四ヶ月ニナツタ為、女ハ癒絶ヲ理由ニ堕胎手術費トシテ四千円ヲ請求シテイル。
一、蓑畑俊二ハ、神戸市山手通ノ秘密クラブ臨時会員トシテ週期的ニ密カニ集イ、有閑マダム、未亡人ト桃色遊戯ニ耽リ、中デモ帝國産業株式会社社長、谷口欣也氏夫人多美子（三十一歳）ヨリ格別溺愛サレ、一男二女ノ母ノ身デアルニモ拘ラズ、俊二ト結婚ヲ誓イ、性格ノ相違ヲ理由トシテ、家庭裁判所ニ双方共正式離婚ノ手続ヲ提出シテイル模様。多美子ハ密通ノ果、目下妊娠ノ徴候アルモノノ胤ハ俊二ノモノトシ俊二モソレヲ認メテ居ル。
葉子はこれ以上読む気力がなくなつた。クラ〜と眩暈がしそうだった。
それでいて良人が憎めないのが不思議だつた。裏切られた口惜しさと腹立たしさをドッと良人にぶちまけてやる立場にありながら、憎悪しないのは、因果に愛しているせいであろう。
ところがその日の夕方、俊二は珍しく早く会社から帰つて来たが、何気なく机の上を見ると、葉子が隠すのを忘れていたらしい、男の差出人からの妻に宛てた一通の手紙を発見した。
「オヤ？ッ」
見馴れない男の筆跡を辿つて行く中みる＼／俊二の心臓は早鐘を打ち始めた。綿々として書綴られた男の恋情。その一言一句が女の心を揺さぶり乱すばかり、求愛の文章に埋められているのだ。
然も、最後のところには、今宵、是非ともお待ちしています。と、逢曳の時間と場所まで記してある。
俊二が愕然となったのも無理はない。
自分のものになりきつて居る筈の妻が、いつの間にか他の男に傾きつつあつた。

**Secrets for Breaking Through the Lassitude Period**

**The Indirect Approach Tactic**

"Heh? Saying it is not interesting, in the end, stimulation for each other has disappeared. Shall I tell you something good, Sister?"
"Something good... [stifled chuckle]?"
"Fu, fu, in other words. [stifled chuckle]"
Across the table, the younger brother’s body leaned out, and he brought his mouth close to his sister's ear.
"How about it? Sister."
A face like "won't you try it?" "My goodness!"
The eyes of the sister were amazed. However, inside Yoko's expression, the color of adventure, having grasped a small hope, was flashing.
While the wife was agonizing in the lassitude period, day and night thinning her body with brows furrowed in anxiety, on the other hand, the husband Toshio, looking extremely carefree, was exchanging idle talk with colleagues during a break at the office.
"For you too, the third wedding anniversary has come. Aren't you already smack in the middle of the lassitude period?"
"It's fine. I have the conviction to break through difficult barriers."
"Conviction? You talk big. Well, if you have that much confidence, that's fine. As for me, in the lassitude period, I met with quite a terrible time. Anyway, the wife went and asked a secret investigation agency, and she completely caught my tail [caught me red-handed]."
"Hey you, was there such a tactic? That's the first I've heard of it."
While he was asking back in surprise, one of the colleagues came and whispered something to Toshio.
"What? About me... [chuckle]?"
"That's right."
An unknown man had come to ask indirectly about Toshio's behavior. Moreover, hearing that the point of the conversation was about women relations, he got a hunch.
"Alright, I'll meet him directly."
Whatever he thought, showing no panic, he leisurely went down from the building rooftop.

One week passed.
Shortly after seeing her husband off, Yoko received the long-awaited investigation report from the secret investigation agency. Impatiently opening the typed pages, her face suddenly changed color.
1. Toshio Minohata recently has a bad reputation even within the company; rumors of dealings with women frequently arise. He has already fallen into a physical relationship with typist Kinuko Tsugawa (21), who is two months pregnant. They were discovered kissing in the toilet, causing a problem.
1. Toshio Minohata frequently visits the cafe world near Namba. He is deeply intimate with a waitress at the bar 'Clara' named Sayuri, alias Hiroko Inoue (23). Giving her considerable money and goods like rings, dresses, and shoes, he has repeatedly invited her to hotels and inns. Because she became four months pregnant, the woman is demanding 4,000 yen for abortion costs as a reason for breaking up.
1. Toshio Minohata secretly gathers periodically as a temporary member of a secret club in Yamate-dori, Kobe. He indulges in 'pink' play with idle madams and widows. Among them, he is particularly doted on by Tamiko (31), wife of Mr. Kinya Taniguchi, president of Teikoku Sangyo Co. Despite being a mother of one son and two daughters, she has sworn marriage to Toshio and has reportedly submitted formal divorce papers to the family court citing personality differences. As a result of the secret affair, she shows signs of pregnancy, but claims the child is Toshio's, and Toshio admits it.
Yoko lost the energy to read further. She felt dizzy.
And yet, it was strange she couldn't hate her husband. While in a position to vent her regret and anger at being betrayed, the reason she did not feel hatred was likely because she loved him due to karma.
However, that evening, Toshio returned from the office unusually early. Looking casually at the desk, he discovered a letter addressed to his wife from a male sender, which Yoko seemed to have forgotten to hide.
"Oh?"
While tracing the handwriting of an unfamiliar man, Toshio's heart began to beat like a bell. A man's affection written out endlessly. Every single word and phrase was buried in a confession of love that shook and disturbed the woman's heart.
Moreover, at the end, it said, "I will surely be waiting tonight," even noting the time and place of the tryst.
It was no wonder Toshio was stunned.
His wife, who was supposed to be completely his, was, before he knew it, leaning toward another man.

**The Secret to Reviving a Stale Marriage**

**The "Indirect Approach" Tactic**

"Heh? You say it's gotten boring? Well, that just means you’ve lost the spark. Shall I let you in on a little secret, Sis?"
"A secret? *Chuckles.*"
"Heh heh. Listen..."
Across the table, the younger brother leaned in and whispered into his sister's ear.
"Well? What do you think, Sis?"
His expression was a dare: *Why not give it a try?* "My goodness!" Yoko’s eyes widened in disbelief. Yet, beneath the shock, a glimmer of adventurous hope flickered in her eyes.

While Yoko agonized over their marital slump, fretting until she grew thin with worry, her husband, Toshio, was the picture of nonchalance. At the office, he idly chatted with his colleagues during a break.
"Three years of marriage now, isn't it? You must be right in the thick of the 'three-year itch,'" a coworker remarked.
"I’ll be fine," Toshio replied breezily. "I have the conviction to get through any rough patch."
"Conviction? Bold words. If you're that confident, good for you. Me? I had a hell of a time during my slump. My wife went and hired a private eye, caught me red-handed."
"Wait, there’s a trick like that? Tell me more."
As Toshio pressed for details, another colleague approached and whispered something in his ear.
"What? Someone's asking about me?" Toshio chuckled.
"Yeah. Some guy’s been poking around, asking about your private life. Specifically, about other women." Toshio’s intuition flared.
"Fine. I’ll go deal with him myself." Without a hint of panic, he headed downstairs from the rooftop.

A week later.
Shortly after Toshio left for work, Yoko received the report she had been waiting for from the detective agency. Tearing it open with trembling hands, her face went pale as she read the typed lines:
1. *Subject: Toshio Minohata. Rumors of workplace misconduct are rampant. He is currently involved with a 21-year-old typist, Kinuko Tsugawa, who is two months pregnant. They were reportedly caught in a compromising position at the office.*
1. *Subject frequently visits the 'Clara' bar in Namba, where he is intimate with a waitress named Sayuri (23). He has showered her with gifts—rings, dresses—and took her to hotels. She is four months pregnant and demanding 4,000 yen for medical expenses to terminate the pregnancy.*
1. *Subject is a regular at an elite secret club in Kobe, where he has become the favorite of Tamiko Taniguchi (31), the wife of a major industrialist. Despite having three children, she is seeking a divorce to marry him. She is currently pregnant, allegedly with the subject's child.*

Yoko felt the world spinning. She couldn't read any further. And yet, she found she couldn't bring herself to hate him. Perhaps it was some deep-seated, karmic love that kept her from screaming in rage.

That evening, however, Toshio returned home unusually early. On the desk, he spotted a letter Yoko had apparently forgotten to hide.
"What's this?"
As he scanned the unfamiliar handwriting, Toshio’s heart began to race. It was a passionate love letter, filled with flowery professions of affection that seemed designed to sweep a woman off her feet. At the bottom, a time and place for a secret rendezvous were clearly listed.
Toshio stood there, paralyzed with shock. His wife—the woman he assumed would always belong to him—was slipping into the arms of another man.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** The text is presented in a classic vertical Japanese layout (tategaki), read from right to left. It occupies a full page or a significant column of a magazine.
*   **Typography:** The title uses a stylized, bold typeface with a decorative horizontal border. The body text uses a standard Mincho-style font common in mid-century printing.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The main title is at the top right, followed by a subhead. The detective report is clearly delineated using a different character style—specifically, the report is written using a mix of Kanji and Katakana for particles, which mimics the formal, cold style of official or legal documents of the time (the "Tei-gaki" or "Katakana-majiri" style).
*   **Text Features:**
    *   **Furigana:** Small rubi characters are used for some kanji (e.g., 軀 - karada, 憇々 - monmon, 逢曳 - abiki).
    *   **Punctuation:** Quotation marks (「 」) and exclamation/question marks are used. The use of "クックッ" (stifled laughter) provides a cinematic, pulp-fiction feel.
    *   **Iteration Marks:** Characters like "々" and "＼＼" (vertical repetition marks) are used.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** The orthography (old kana like *居る*, *あつた*) and the setting (mentions of "cafes" in Namba, "typists," and "secret clubs") suggest the **late 1940s or early 1950s**. This was the era of the "Kasutori" magazines—cheap, sensationalist publications that often featured stories about sex, scandal, and marital strife.
*   **Kentaiki (倦怠期):** This refers to the "period of lassitude" or the "slump" in a marriage (often called the seven-year itch, though the text mentions three years). It was a common theme in post-war literature as social morals were shifting.
*   **Secret Investigation Agencies (秘密探偵社):** Private detectives were a staple of the era's pulp fiction, often hired to catch cheating spouses.
*   **Monetary Value:** The mention of "4,000 yen" for an abortion is a key historical marker. In the early 1950s, 4,000 yen was a significant sum (roughly equivalent to a month's salary for a starting office worker).
*   **The "Indirect Approach" (Karamete):** The title "Karamete Senjutsu" (搦め手戦術) refers to a tactical move where one doesn't attack the front gate but rather the back entrance. In this story, it refers to the psychological tactic of using jealousy or "scandal" to reignite a spouse's interest.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **搦め手 (Karamete):** Originally the "back gate" of a castle. Idiomatically, it means an indirect or sneaky method of achieving a goal.
*   **杞憂 (Kiyū):** Groundless anxiety; worrying about something that will likely never happen.
*   **尻ッぽを摑む (Shippo o tsukamu):** Literally "to catch the tail"; to catch someone red-handed or find proof of wrongdoing.
*   **有閑マダム (Yūkan Madamu):** "Leisured ladies" or "women of the idle rich." A common trope in 1950s Japanese media referring to wealthy, bored wives who might engage in affairs.
*   **桃色遊戯 (Momoiro Yūgi):** "Pink play," a euphemism for sexual dalliances or erotic affairs.
*   **胤 (Tane):** Literally "seed," used here to mean the biological father of a child.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Irony of the Tactic":** The brother suggests a tactic (likely faking an affair or hiring a detective) to save the marriage. The twist is that while the wife receives a (possibly fake or exaggerated) report about the husband, the husband finds a (possibly fake) letter to the wife. 
*   **Mutual Jealousy as a Cure:** The subtext suggests that marital boredom arises from security. By introducing the threat of a third party, the couple is forced to "re-value" each other.
*   **Gender Roles:** The husband is depicted as "carefree" while the wife "withers" with worry, reflecting traditional gender expectations of the time. However, the wife's willingness to engage in "adventure" suggests a nascent post-war independence.
*   **Pulp Sensationalism:** The detective report is intentionally lurid (multiple pregnancies, secret clubs, affairs with high-society wives) to titillate the reader.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp Fiction.
*   **Genre:** Drama, Romance, Domestic Satire.
*   **Themes:** Infidelity (real or perceived), Marriage, Jealousy, Detectives, 1950s Urban Life.
*   **Tone:** Cynical, Sensationalist, Slightly Humorous.
