## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**12**
That next day also, and the next day after that also, it was so.
From then, the same thing every night was repeated.
Somehow, at times such as when Tōbei's time going to the bath was a little late, there were even things like it appearing that the woman side was waiting, and purposely handing over a hand-towel and going home.

**13**
He, until now, from one woman this many times hand-towels obtaining thing was not. Until now, even walking around various bathhouses, at most two or three a month, or even at good times only about four or five harvest, but lately efficiency rose steadily-steadily, so he was completely in high spirits.
But, now, with just hand-towels anymore, he was not satisfied.

**14**
At times, the woman's legs that sometimes smoothly coiled like a snake were waited for. The strange coquetry that woman showed while in the bath made his head go dizzy-dizzy.
That night, finishing drinking his nightcap as usual, while drying that day's hand-towel over the remaining fire of the long brazier, in the corner of it, he noticed that something like characters was written.

**15**
[Signs:] Umegayu (Plum Bath), Tsumegami (Hairdressing?), Jiridouzashi (?)

**16**
"The bell of Kure-mutsu (6 PM). Jizō Bridge."
He, the next day, exactly at the time of Kure-mutsu, at the foot of Jizō Bridge met the woman of Chōji-yu (Clove Bath), and was welcomed into the inner parlor of a deep-set residence.
"There is nothing that might suit your palate, but please, take your time and eat."

**17**
The woman amiably took up the sake decanter and urged him. He, with a feeling like being bewitched by a fox, took up the sake cup.
Tōbei, who became absorbed in drinking more than enough of the windfall happiness of feast-liquor, did not know even himself what he was talking about.
Until the point of burying his face in the quilt of the kotatsu and taking a nap, he faintly remembered, but from then on, he knew nothing.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**12**
The next day was the same, and the day after that as well. The pattern repeated itself every night. There were even times when Tōbei arrived late to the bathhouse only to find the woman seemingly waiting for him, as if she were intent on making sure he received a hand-towel before she departed.

**13**
Never before had he received so many tokens from a single woman. In the past, even when he spent his nights prowling from one bathhouse to another, he considered himself lucky to harvest two or three towels a month—maybe five at best. But lately, his "efficiency" had improved so dramatically that he was riding a wave of immense self-satisfaction. Yet, towels alone were no longer enough to satisfy his growing desire.

**14**
He found himself longing for the touch of her legs, which sometimes coiled around him with the smooth, lithe grace of a snake. The mysterious, seductive air she maintained while in the water left his head spinning. That night, after finishing his usual nightcap, he was drying the day’s towel over the embers of the hearth when he noticed something peculiar: a few faint characters written in the corner of the fabric.

**15**

**16**
*“The evening bell at six. Jizō Bridge.”*
The following day, exactly as the evening bell tolled six, Tōbei met the woman from the Chōji-yu bathhouse at the foot of Jizō Bridge. She led him into the secluded inner sanctum of a sprawling residence. “I’m afraid we have nothing special to suit your refined taste,” she said demurely, “but please, make yourself at home and enjoy what little we have.”

**17**
With a charming smile, she raised the sake decanter and pressed him to drink. Tōbei accepted the cup, feeling as though he were under a fox's spell. Lost in the haze of this unexpected stroke of luck and the fine liquor flowing freely, he chattered away, though even he couldn't have said what he was talking about. He had a faint memory of burying his face in the kotatsu quilt to drift off to sleep, but after that, everything went blank.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format:** This is a page from a serialized illustrated story (*em物語* or *gekiga* precursor). It combines narrative blocks of text with accompanying illustrations that depict the scenes described.
*   **Typography:** The text is set in traditional vertical orientation (*tategaki*). It uses an older typeface typical of the mid-20th century, featuring historical kana usage (e.g., さう for そう, 思はれる for 思われる).
*   **Layout:** The page is divided into numbered panels (12 through 17). The numbers are written in kanji (十二, 十三, etc.) within small boxes.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The illustrations occupy significant space, setting the mood. The text blocks are placed around the images, creating a flow that leads the reader through the sequence of events.
*   **Repetition Marks:** The text uses the iteration mark "〜" (specifically the *odoriji* for "gun-gun" and "fura-fura") which was common in printing of that era to indicate repeated sounds or adverbs.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era/Genre:** This appears to be from the late 1940s to early 1950s. This was the era of *kasutori* (dregs) magazines—cheaply made, often erotic or sensationalist publications that thrived during the post-war occupation of Japan.
*   **The Bathhouse (*Sento*):** In the Edo period setting of the story, bathhouses often employed *yuna* (bathhouse girls) who provided services ranging from scrubbing backs to prostitution. The "hand-towel" (*tenugui*) mentioned is a traditional gift/token of affection or a signal for a rendezvous.
*   **Timekeeping:** "Kure-mutsu" (暮六ツ) refers to the traditional Japanese time system. It is the "sixth hour of dusk," roughly 6:00 PM (sunset).
*   **Fox Bewitchment:** The phrase "kitsune ni tsumamareta" (bewitched by a fox) refers to the folklore belief that foxes (*kitsune*) could trick humans into hallucinations, often involving fake feasts that turn out to be leaves or dirt once the spell breaks. This hints at a supernatural or deceptive element to the woman's invitation.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **手拭 (Tenugui):** A traditional Japanese cotton towel. In the context of "harvesting" them from women, it implies Tōbei is a seducer or a regular who collects these as trophies of his conquests.
*   **媚態 (Bitai):** Coquetry, flirtatious behavior, or seductive charms.
*   **能率 (Nōritsu):** Efficiency. Here used ironically to describe his success rate with women.
*   **長火鉢 (Nagahibachi):** A traditional long wooden brazier used for heating and light cooking.
*   **銚子 (Chōshi):** A sake decanter.
*   **狐につゝまれた (Kitsune ni tsumamareta):** To be bewildered, as if by a fox's spell.
*   **馳走酒 (Chisō-zake):** Feast-liquor; sake served as part of a hospitable treat.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Eroticism and Mystery:** The text focuses on the physical allure of the woman (her snake-like legs) and the mysterious nature of her invitation. The tone is suggestive without being explicit.
*   **The "Honey Trap" / Supernatural Suspicion:** The mention of being "bewitched by a fox" and the sudden "blackout" at the end of the text strongly suggest that Tōbei is being lured into a trap, either by a criminal or a supernatural entity.
*   **Masculine Ego:** The narrative mockingly describes Tōbei’s pride in his "efficiency" at collecting towels, setting him up for a fall. He believes he is the seducer, but panel 17 shows he is clearly the one being manipulated.

*   **Genre:** Edo-period noir, Erotic-Grotesque (Ero-guro) light, Folklore-inspired fiction.
