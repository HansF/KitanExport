## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

スイッチをひねろうとして、ふと寝ている私の顔を見下したからであつた。そこに彼女は、しげしげとながめ入つている私の眼をカチリと目つかまえた。彼女はニマリとつて、プイとそりかえり、静かに消燈した。向うの窓から赤い阪神の電飾がチカリと見えた。空には、かわらぬ星くずが、ばらまかれて、青くまたたいていた。

　　**３　賣れ殘りの醜女**

「梅田のお新とかいつたな。私の尻の傷は一体誰がつけたのかね。それをいつておくれ。ね、意識不明の三時間のことがはつきりすれば、一と晩でも二た晩でも、いつづけて遊んであげるよ。さあ、いつてごらん。いえないのかい。なぜそんなに、だまつているの。お新、誰なのか。まさかお前じやないだろうね。お前かい。お前ならお前と、はつきりいつておくれ……」
　私は、もう蛇のような執拗さで、昨夜の私の行動が知りたかつた。しかし肝心のお新は、熔鉱炉の火焔のような肉体を蒲團にからませているだけで、追求する私の口を閉じてしまおうとするのだつた。
　彼女の返事はなかつた。
「畜生、お前だな。」
　私は、そう思うと、お新という女が百倍も憎くなつて、彼女の首をしめている手に力がこもつた。
　このまましめ殺してやろう。いやーと思いに、息の根をとめるのでは、おもしろくない。チクリチクリと刺して刺して、刺し殺してやるんだ、エッヘッヘッ……。彼女の指が私のワキの下をくすぐつたので、ふと私は悪魔のような笑い声を出した。
「何ということをしやがるんだ。こちらが焼火鉢で殴つたのは、このお新だろう。この手、この手でジリツ、ジリツと焼きを入れたんだろう。パーマネントをよくも尻へかけやがつたな。」
　私がいくら責めても。彼女は、おしのようにだまつている。
　それはかなり長い時間であつたろう。目がさめて見ると意外にも、私の傍らに、ゴロンゴロンといびきを立てて寝ている女は、お新ではなく、色の黒い、歯のきたない、カボチヤ見たいな醜女であつた。
　それは、消燈してあつても、明けそめる空の光りが、明りとりのガラス窓から流れ込んでできていたので、はつきりとわかつた。
「お新じやなかつたのかい。お新はどこへいつたのだい。」
　私は、その女をゆり起してたずねた。
「お新なんて、いるものですか。いまいまごろ、いい男を抱いているでしょうよ。」
　破れ太鼓のような、調子はずれのガサガサ聲であつた。ああ、こんな女と寝ていたのかお新、曾根崎のお新、梅田のお新、カミソリのお新といつたけ。
　たしかに、私はそれを肌でさえ感じている。あまりにもコクメイに刻みつけられた、生々しい印象であつただけに、お新とは似てもつかぬ醜女をそこに見て、まるでキツネにつままれたような気持になるのだつた。
　お新は、さつと私が寝しずまると、姿をそつと消したものに違いない。私のウカツさというよりも、むしろ梅田娘たちのすばやさ、功利的なサービスぶりに、またしても背負投げを食つた私であつた。
「もう帰るの。」
　彼女は、まだ寝たまま、洋服をつけている私を見上げる。
「うん、さんざんな目にあつたからな。これ以上、つかまつていたら、どんなひどい目にあうかも知れないよ」
「エヘエヘ……」
　実はケタケタケタとも聞えた。ちよどその中間調かな。まさにそのくずれた醜面から、私はバケモノをはつきり意識して、ぞつと脊筋をはしるものがあつた。
「あんた、だまつて帰えるのかい。サービス料くらいおいていくものよ。お新さんでなくて悪かつたけどねえ。」
　ああ、私は泣きたかつた。それでは消燈と同時にお新は消え失せたのか。古い言葉だけど可愛さあまつて憎さが百倍という。ちようどお新こそは、私にとつて憎さあまつて可愛さ百倍という逆な対象であつた。
　私は、うちポケットの札入れを出して見た。昨夜一万円借出したばかりなのに、半分以上減つていた。なるほどというところが、まあ、よかつた。実は助かつたと思つたのだ。
　そのうちから数枚を抜いて、醜女の顔の上からバラバラと礼吹雪をふかせてやつた。
　市電が動き出していた。梅田界わいは、まだ眠つていたがサラリーマンや労働者の群れが、もう舗道にいそがしい足を波うたせていた。
　私は、眠りたりない眼をこすりながら阪急へ入ると、入口に立つているタバコ娘が近寄つてきた。
「タバコはどうです」
　あツ、と聲を立てんばかりに、私はそのタバコ娘の顔をのぞきこんだ。赤いスエーター、豊かな胸のもりあがり、こげ茶色のズボンに白足袋、下駄であつた。
　ルビーのように新鮮で甘い娘こそは、昨夜、私がガード下の暗がりでとめど楽しみんだベニ子と同じものではないか。
「キ、キ、キミだろう。昨夜、ね。ベニ子さんだろう、」
　私は、ピースを三つ買つてやつた。金を渡すとき、その手をにぎりしめたら、彼女は、鼻に小じわをよせて笑いながら、
「ちがうわよ、ちがうわよ……。」
　といった。その聲が、動作の一つ一つがベニ子であつた。たしかにベニ子であつた。

スイッチをひねろうとして、ふと寝ている私の顔を見下ろしたからであった。そこに彼女は、しげしげと眺め入っている私の眼をカチリと捕まえた。彼女はニマリと笑って、プイとそりかえり、静かに消灯した。向こうの窓から赤い阪神の電飾がチカリと見えた。空には、変わらぬ星屑が、ばらまかれて、青く瞬いていた。

　　**３　売れ残りの醜女（しこめ）**

「梅田のお新とか言ったな。私の尻の傷は一体誰がつけたのかね。それを言っておくれ。ねえ、意識不明の三時間のことがはっきりすれば、一晩でも二晩でも、居続けて遊んであげるよ。さあ、言ってごらん。言えないのかい。なぜそんなに、黙っているの。お新、誰なのか。まさかお前じゃないだろうね。お前かい。お前ならお前と、はっきり言っておくれ……」
　私は、もう蛇のような執拗さで、昨夜の私の行動が知りたかった。しかし肝心のお新は、熔鉱炉の火炎のような肉体を布団にからませているだけで、追及する私の口を閉じてしまおうとするのだった。
　彼女の返事はなかった。
「畜生、お前だな。」
　私は、そう思うと、お新という女が百倍も憎くなって、彼女の首を絞めている手に力がこもった。
　このまま絞め殺してやろう。いや、一思いに、息の根を止めるのでは、面白くない。チクリチクリと刺して刺して、刺し殺してやるんだ、エッヘッヘ……。彼女の指が私の脇の下をくすぐったので、ふと私は悪魔のような笑い声を出した。
「何ということをしやがるんだ。こちらが焼き火鉢で殴ったのは、このお新だろう。この手、この手でジリリ、ジリリと焼きを入れたんだろう。パーマネントをよくも尻へかけやがったな。」
　私がいくら責めても、彼女は、押しのように黙っている。
　それはかなり長い時間であったろう。目が覚めて見ると意外にも、私の傍らに、ゴロンゴロンとイビキを立てて寝ている女は、お新ではなく、色の黒い、歯の汚い、カボチャみたいな醜女であった。
　それは、消灯してあっても、明け初める空の光が、明かり取りのガラス窓から流れ込んでできていたので、はっきりとわかった。
「お新じゃなかったのかい。お新はどこへ行ったのだい。」
　私は、その女を揺り起こして尋ねた。
「お新なんて、いるものですか。今ごろ、いい男を抱いているでしょうよ。」
　破れ太鼓のような、調子外れのガサガサ声であった。ああ、こんな女と寝ていたのか。お新、曽根崎のお新、梅田のお新、カミソリのお新と言ったっけ。
　確かに、私はそれを肌でさえ感じている。あまりにも克明に刻みつけられた、生々しい印象であっただけに、お新とは似てもつかぬ醜女をそこに見て、まるで狐につままれたような気持ちになるのだった。
　お新は、さっと私が寝静まると、姿をそっと消したものに違いない。私の迂闊さというよりも、むしろ梅田娘たちの素早さ、功利的なサービスぶりに、またしても背負い投げを食った私であった。
「もう帰るの。」
　彼女は、まだ寝たまま、洋服を着ている私を見上げる。
「うん、散々な目にあったからな。これ以上、捕まっていたら、どんなひどい目に遭うかも知れないよ」
「エヘエヘ……」
　実はケタケタケタとも聞こえた。ちょうどその中間調かな。まさにその崩れた醜面から、私は化け物をはっきり意識して、ぞっと背筋を走るものがあった。
「あんた、黙って帰るのかい。サービス料くらい置いていくものよ。お新さんでなくて悪かったけどねえ。」
　ああ、私は泣きたかった。それでは消灯と同時にお新は消え失せたのか。古い言葉だけど「可愛さ余って憎さが百倍」という。ちょうどお新こそは、私にとって憎さ余って可愛さ百倍という逆な対象であった。
　私は、内ポケットの札入れを出して見た。昨夜一万円借出したばかりなのに、半分以上減っていた。なるほどというところが、まあ、よかった。実は助かったと思ったのだ。
　そのうちから数枚を抜いて、醜女の顔の上からバラバラと札吹雪を降らせてやった。
　市電が動き出していた。梅田界隈は、まだ眠っていたがサラリーマンや労働者の群れが、もう舗道に忙しい足を波打たせていた。
　私は、足りない眠り眼をこすりながら阪急へ入ると、入り口に立っているタバコ娘が近寄ってきた。
「タバコはどうです」
　あっ、と声を立てんばかりに、私はそのタバコ娘の顔を覗き込んだ。赤いセーター、豊かな胸の盛り上がり、焦げ茶色のズボンに白足袋、下駄であった。
　ルビーのように新鮮で甘い娘こそは、昨夜、私がガード下の暗がりでとめど楽しみんだベニ子と同じものではないか。
「き、き、君だろう。昨夜、ね。ベニ子さんだろう、」
　私は、ピースを三つ買ってやった。金を渡すとき、その手を握りしめたら、彼女は、鼻に小皺を寄せて笑いながら、
「違うわよ、違うわよ……。」
　と言った。その声が、動作の一つ一つがベニ子であった。確かにベニ子であった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Trying to turn the switch, suddenly sleeping my face looking down because it was. There she, intently looking in my eyes 'kachiri' (click) caught. She 'nimari' (smirked), 'pui' (abruptly) turned away, and quietly extinguished the light. From the window over there, the red Hanshin electric decorations 'chikari' (flickered) were seen. In the sky, unchanging stardust, scattered, blue twinkling was.

    **3 The Unsold Ugly Woman**

"Oshin of Umeda you were called. The wound on my buttocks, who on earth put it? Tell me that. Hey, if the unconscious three hours' matter becomes clear, for one night or two nights, staying and playing I will give you. Now, try telling. You can't say? Why like that, are you silent? Oshin, who is it? Surely it's not you. Is it you? If it's you, say it's you clearly..."
I, already with snake-like persistence, last night's my actions wanted to know. However, the crucial Oshin, like a smelting furnace's flames body into the futon entangling only, the pursuing my mouth trying to close was.
Her reply was not.
"Damn, it's you."
I, thinking so, the woman called Oshin a hundred times more hated became, and her neck strangling hand strength entered.
Like this I'll strangle her to death. No— thinking, in one breath stopping the life, is not interesting. 'Chikuri chikuri' (stabbing) stab and stab, I'll stab her to death, 'ehe-he-he'... Her fingers my armpit tickled, so suddenly I like a devil laughter emitted.
"What kind of thing are you doing. This side burning hibachi with hit was this Oshin, right? This hand, with this hand 'jiriri, jiriri' (sizzling) heat put, right? A permanent (wave) well on my buttocks you dared to apply."
No matter how much I blamed. She, like a mute remained silent.
It was probably a fairly long time. Opening eyes and seeing unexpectedly, by my side, 'goron goron' (heavily) snoring woman, was not Oshin, but dark-skinned, dirty-toothed, pumpkin-like ugly woman was.
That, even with lights out, the dawning sky's light, from the skylight glass window flowing in was, so clearly was understood.
"You weren't Oshin? Where did Oshin go?"
I, shaking that woman awake, asked.
"Oshin, as if such exists. Right about now, she's hugging a good man, I'll bet."
Like a broken drum, out of tune raspy voice it was. Ah, with this kind of woman I was sleeping? Oshin, Oshin of Sonezaki, Oshin of Umeda, Razor Oshin she was called.
Certainly, I even in my skin felt it. Too minutely engraved, vivid impression because it was, Oshin-not-resembling ugly woman there seeing, just like being bewitched by a fox feeling I became.
Oshin, quickly when I fell asleep, her form quietly vanished must have. My carelessness rather than, instead the Umeda girls' speed, utilitarian service-ness, once again a shoulder-throw (judo move/cheated) I was eaten.
"Already going home?"
She, still lying down, dressing myself looks up at.
"Yeah, a terrible time I had. More than this, if I'm caught, what kind of awful eyes (experience) I'll meet I don't know."
"Ehe-ehe..."
Actually 'keta-keta-keta' (cackle) it sounded. Just about that middle tone, maybe. Truly from that ruined ugly face, I a monster clearly recognized, 'zo-tto' (chill) my spine ran.
"You, silently going home? Service fee at least leave. Not being Oshin-san was bad, but hey."
Ah, I wanted to cry. Then with the lights out simultaneously Oshin vanished? Old words but "love overflowing hate becomes a hundredfold" they say. Exactly Oshin was, for me hate overflowing love becomes a hundredfold opposite target she was.
I, inner pocket wallet took out and looked. Last night 10,000 yen borrowed just now, more than half decreased was. "I see" part was, well, good. Actually "I'm saved" I thought.
From within that several bills pulling out, over the ugly woman's face 'bara-bara' (scatteringly) bill-blizzard I made fall.
The city tram had started moving. Umeda neighborhood, still was sleeping but salarymen and workers' crowds, already on the sidewalk busy feet waving were.
I, lacking sleep eyes rubbing while entering Hankyu, at the entrance standing tobacco girl approached.
"Tobacco, how about it?"
"Ah!" a voice making almost, I that tobacco girl's face looked into. Red sweater, rich breast swell, dark brown pants with white tabi, geta was.
Like a ruby fresh and sweet girl, last night, I under the guard-rail darkness endlessly enjoyed Beniko same thing is she not?
"Y-y-you, right? Last night, eh. You're Beniko-san, right?"
I, Peace (cigarettes) three bought. Money when passing, that hand gripped, she, on nose small wrinkles gathering while laughing,
"It's different, it's different..."
said. That voice, every single movement was Beniko. Certainly she was Beniko.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

I had intended to flick the light switch, but I stopped because I found myself staring down at my own face as I slept. In that moment, her eyes locked onto mine—mine, which were peering so intently at her. She gave a thin smirk, turned away abruptly, and quietly put out the light. Through the window, the red neon signs of the Hanshin line flickered. In the sky, an eternal dusting of stars remained scattered, twinkling with a cold, blue light.

**3. The Leftover Wench**

"You said your name was Oshin of Umeda, didn't you? Tell me—who gave me this wound on my backside? If you can account for those three hours I was blacked out, I’ll stay and play with you for a night, or even two. Come on, out with it. Can't speak? Why so quiet? Oshin, who was it? It wasn't you, was it? If it was, just say so..."
I pressed her with the tenacity of a serpent; I was desperate to know what I’d done the night before. But the girl I took for Oshin merely tangled her limbs—hot as the fires of a smelting furnace—around the bedding, as if trying to smother my questioning mouth.
She offered no reply.
"Damn you, it *was* you."
The thought made my hatred for this woman called Oshin swell a hundredfold. I tightened my grip around her throat.
*I should just strangle her right here,* I thought. But no—snuffing her out all at once would be no fun. I wanted to prick her, again and again, and watch her die slowly. "Heh-heh-heh..." When her fingers tickled my armpit, a devilish laugh escaped my lips.
"How dare you. You're the one I struck with the hot poker, aren't you, Oshin? It was these hands, wasn't it? The ones that sizzled as they branded me. You had the nerve to give my backside a 'permanent wave' with that iron!"
No matter how I interrogated her, she remained as silent as a stone.
A considerable amount of time must have passed. When I finally woke and looked beside me, the woman snoring heavily was not Oshin. She was dark-skinned, with filthy teeth—an ugly creature who looked like a withered pumpkin. 
The light of the dawning sky was filtering through the glass skylight, making her features undeniably clear despite the lamp being off.
"You're not Oshin? Where the hell did Oshin go?" I demanded, shaking her awake.
"Oshin? There's no Oshin here," she rasped in a voice like a cracked drum. "She's probably in some handsome man's arms by now."
It was a jarring, discordant sound. God, was *this* the woman I’d been with? Oshin of Sonezaki, Oshin of Umeda, "Razor Oshin"—whatever they called her. I could still feel the phantom touch on my skin; the impression was so vivid, so minutely engraved in my memory, that seeing this hag who looked nothing like her made me feel as if I'd been bewitched by a fox.
The real Oshin must have vanished the moment I fell into a deep sleep. It wasn't just my own carelessness; I’d simply been outmaneuvered once again by the predatory speed and ruthless efficiency of these Umeda girls.
"Leaving already?" the woman asked, looking up at me from the bed as I pulled on my clothes.
"Yeah. I've had a hell of a time. If I stay here any longer, there's no telling what other disasters will befall me."
"Heh, heh..." 
Her laugh sounded more like a dry cackle. Looking at that ruined, hideous face, I truly felt I was looking at a monster. A chill ran down my spine.
"You're just going to walk out? You should at least leave a service fee. Sorry I wasn't Oshin, but still."
I wanted to cry. Had Oshin vanished the second the lights went out? There’s an old saying: "Love overflowing turns to a hundredfold hate." For me, Oshin was the reverse: my hate had boiled over into a hundredfold obsession.
I checked the wallet in my breast pocket. I’d borrowed ten thousand yen just last night, and more than half was gone. *Of course it is,* I thought. Surprisingly, I felt relieved. It felt like the price of an escape.
I pulled out a few remaining bills and showered them over the woman’s face like a blizzard of paper.
The city trams were starting to run. Umeda was still mostly asleep, but waves of salarymen and laborers were already beginning their frantic march along the pavement. 
Rubbing my sleep-deprived eyes, I stepped into the Hankyu station. A girl at a tobacco kiosk approached me.
"Cigarettes, sir?"
I nearly gasped and leaned in to peer at her face. A red sweater, a full chest, dark brown trousers, white tabi, and wooden geta. This girl—fresh and sweet as a ruby—was she not the same "Beniko" I’d enjoyed myself with in the shadows under the rail tracks last night?
"I-it's you, isn't it? From last night. You're Beniko, right?"
I bought three packs of Peace. When I handed her the money, I squeezed her hand. She crinkled her nose and laughed.
"You've got the wrong girl, sir. It's not me..."
But that voice, every single gesture—it was Beniko. It was definitely Beniko.

—The End—

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Typography:** The text uses a mixture of *Kyūjitai* (pre-1946 traditional kanji, e.g., 賣, 殘, 醜, 燈) and *Shinjitai* (modern forms), which is typical of the immediate post-war transition period (late 1940s to early 1950s). The kana usage is modern (*Gendai Kanazukai*), suggesting a publication date after 1946.
*   **Layout:** Standard Japanese vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*). The story is titled "3" suggesting it is part of a series of vignettes or a numbered collection.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title "賣れ殘りの醜女" (The Leftover Ugly Woman) is bolded and centered in the column. The text uses repetition marks (々) and specific onomatopoeic formatting (e.g., small "ッ" for glottal stops).
*   **Punctuation:** Uses standard Japanese commas (、) and periods (。), with western-style quotation marks (「 」). It also uses dashes (―) for the "The End" marker.
*   **Print Quality:** The presence of some "bleeding" or faintness in the ink suggests a mass-market magazine or a "Kasutori" (pulp) publication, common in the post-war era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **The Era (Late 1940s - 1950s):** The mention of "10,000 yen" as a significant sum that can be "half-gone" in one night points to the post-war inflationary period. The setting (Umeda, Sonezaki) is the heart of Osaka's nightlife and black-market districts during the Occupation.
*   **"Pan-pan" Girls and Streetwalkers:** The characters "Oshin" and "Beniko" represent the "street girls" or clandestine prostitutes common in ruined urban centers after WWII. The narrator's paranoia about being robbed or "cheated" by these girls reflects the social instability of the time.
*   **Umeda/Sonezaki:** These areas in Osaka were famous for their underground economies and entertainment districts. "Sonezaki no Oshin" sounds like a nickname for a well-known local figure or a specific type of street performer/prostitute.
*   **Peace Cigarettes:** Launched in 1946, "Peace" was a premium brand in post-war Japan. Buying three packs at once was a sign of relative wealth or a "big spender" attitude.
*   **Fashion:** The "red sweater," "brown trousers," "white tabi," and "geta" describe a mix of westernizing fashion and traditional footwear common among the working class and "modern girls" (moga) of the era.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **賣れ残り (Urenokori):** Literally "unsold goods." Used disparagingly here for a woman who has passed her "prime" or is unwanted.
*   **醜女 (Shikome/Shu-jo):** An ugly woman. In ancient Japanese mythology, "Yomotsu-shikome" were hags of the underworld.
*   **背負投げを食う (Seoinage o kuu):** Literally "to be given a shoulder throw" (from Judo). Idiomatically, it means to be betrayed, deceived, or unexpectedly defeated.
*   **キツネにつままれる (Kitsune ni tsumamareru):** "To be pinched by a fox." A common idiom meaning to be completely bewildered or feel like one is being tricked by magic/illusions.
*   **功利的な (Kōriteki-na):** Utilitarian or calculated. Used here to describe the transactional, cold nature of the city's sex workers.
*   **札吹雪 (Satsufubuki):** A "blizzard of bills." Throwing money over someone in a show of arrogance or disdain.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Misogyny and Dehumanization:** The narrator oscillates between violent fantasies (strangling Oshin) and intense revulsion for the "ugly" woman. Women are treated as interchangeable commodities or "monsters" (bakemono).
*   **Illusion vs. Reality:** The core of the story is the narrator's inability to distinguish between the "beautiful" Oshin/Beniko and the "ugly" reality. This reflects post-war cynicism—the idea that beauty is a fleeting, nighttime illusion, while the morning reveals a grim, "ugly" truth.
*   **Post-War Trauma and Nihilism:** The narrator's "snake-like" persistence and "devilish" laughter, combined with the casual mention of physical wounds (the burn/cut on his backside), suggest a society numbed to violence and moral decay.
*   **Economic Transaction:** Every interaction is colored by money—the 10,000 yen debt, the "service fee," the purchase of cigarettes. Human connection has been entirely replaced by cash.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Pulp (Kasutori).
