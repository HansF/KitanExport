**[Main Story]**

橋の商館の多い川口居留地だ。
この辺一帯も草ぼうぼうの焼野原だつたはずだが、人間に色気と食気は外せないものと見えて、バラツクながら飲み屋、食い物屋それに問題の特殊喫茶店が押すな／＼と立ちならんで、昔の松島以上の繁昌ぶりなのにびっくりした。
　もっとも接客婦諸嬢の勇猛果敢なお客争奪合戦は、さすがに昔鳴らした松島遊廓の伝統にそむかない。女子ラグビー團ができたなら、松島チームの優勝は疑いなし！
　その猛烈な女群のタックルをひらりひらりとかわしながら歩いて行く僕のうしろから、いつのまにか、一人の男がついて来ていた。
「大将、大将、えゝべ」
薄暗い横丁にさしかゝると、その男はぐるりとまわつて僕の前に立ちふさがった。
「ちよつとこっちへ寄っとくなはれ、警察に見つかると、うるさいさかい」
男は一軒のタバコ屋の軒へ僕をひつぱつた。
「なんだい？、いゝタマを世話してくれるのかい」
「そらぁ、大将がたのまはんのやつたら、なんぼでも世話しまつけどな、わてはポン引とちがいまつせ」
「ふうん、だつたら？」
「これだすがな、大将！」
じろりとまわりを見渡して、人気がないとわかると、男は腕にかゝえていたカバンからすばやく五六枚の絵ハガキを出すと、
「本物だす、ちよっと高うおまつせ」
とパラパラとめくつてみせた。おぼろ気な灯影ではつきりとはわからないが、白い身体と身体、腕と腕、足と足がからみあつているのがちらりと見えた。
「どうだす…、早うきめとなはれ五枚で五百円、よう売れまつせ、女の方は、いま賣り出しの映画女優だつせ…」
「……」
「うん、そうだな」
「あ」
「ちよっと、こんな掘出物が気に入りはまへんか仕方がおまへんもう一枚とびきり上等の絵も添えまつさ、ほら……」
今度ちらりとのぞかせたのは半紙半分ぐらいの下の方に、あぐらをかいた白い足、それになまめかしく締まる真赤な布地。
「写真五枚と肉筆画一枚、これで五百円！、他におまへんで、大将！」
僕はだまつてドル入れから百円札を五枚引きぬき男の手に押しつけた。
「べえ、大きに…」
男は僕の上着のポケットに写真と絵を押しこむと、脱兎のように暗い闇の中に消え去つて行った。
…で讀者諸君よ、もしぜひこの写真と絵を見たかつたら僕を訪ねていらつしやい。白晝堂々と、お日様のかんかん照つている下で穴のあくほど見せてあげますよ。
なぜつてですか？。写真の方は、夏の大相撲の立合実況の絵ハガキですし、絵の方はですね、芝居の弁天小僧菊之助が浜松屋の店先でユスつている絵ですからね。
全くこわい所ですよ、松島という所は昔から……。

**[Bottom Right Essay]**

**便所のらくがき**
「らくがき」は一つの人生伴侶のものらしい。人間手に筆を持つ年頃、四ツ五ツになると鉛筆の芯をナメ〜、紙に向つて、馬だの、ワンワンだのと言つて、ワケもわからないものを書きなぐる。
小学校の一年生にもなれば、凸坊同志の悪口を書く、そうして追々大人に至るまで、いろ〜な形式でらくがきを続けてゆく。
どうして、人間が樂書をするかという問題は——どうも人間感情の動機である以上、自分の気持に何かしらわだかまりが存在している。それを晴らそうとするに、友に語るも、妻に語るも、その吐露すべき処のない時、先人も言つたように、物言わねば腹ふくるゝわざ、げに、らくがきこそ心中の煽りを簡単に放言出来るものであるからである。
從つてらくがきは、決して名文句もいらないし、思考推敲の必要もない極めて瞬間な気持で書けばよいのである。共同便所の壁に極めて拙劣な文句で書き散らされる卑猥極まる樂書には困つたものだが——あれも性の告白——と解釈するのも妙だが、一種の放官的な自慰行為と見るべきではなかろうか。それが婦人便所に多いのも一つの趣山と見られるからである。
あるコレクト、マニアが樂書を丹念に写しとつて歩いた報告によると、或る植物園の便所に「樂書は瞬間的の藝術なり」と記してあつたそうな。

橋の商館の多い川口居留地だ。
この辺一帯も草ぼうぼうの焼野原だったはずだが、人間に色気と食気は外せないものと見えて、バラックながら飲み屋、食い物屋それに問題の特殊喫茶店が押すな押すなと立ち並んで、昔の松島以上の繁盛ぶりなのにびっくりした。
もっとも接客婦諸嬢の勇猛果敢なお客争奪合戦は、さすがに昔鳴らした松島遊郭の伝統に背かない。女子ラグビー団ができたなら、松島チームの優勝は疑いなし！
その猛烈な女群のタックルをひらりひらりとかわしながら歩いて行く僕の後ろから、いつの間にか、一人の男がついて来ていた。
「大将、大将、ええべ（良いのがあるよ）」
薄暗い横丁に差し掛かると、その男はぐるりと回って僕の前に立ちふさがった。
「ちょっとこっちへ寄っとくなはれ、警察に見つかると、うるさいさかい（うるさいから）」
男は一軒のタバコ屋の軒へ僕を引っ張った。
「なんだい？、良いタマ（女）を世話してくれるのかい」
「そらぁ、大将が頼まはるのやったら、いくらでも世話しまっけどな、わてはポン引き（女衒）とは違いまっせ」
「ふうん、だったら？」
「これだすがな、大将！」
じろりと周りを見渡して、人気がないとわかると、男は腕に抱えていたカバンから素早く五、六枚の絵葉書を出すと、

「写真五枚と肉筆画一枚、これで五百円！ 他におまへんで、大将！」
僕は黙ってドル入れから百円札を五枚引き抜き、男の手に押しつけた。
「べえ（へえ）、おおきに…」
男は僕の上着のポケットに写真と絵を押し込むと、脱兎のように暗い闇の中に消え去って行った。
…で、読者諸君よ、もしぜひこの写真と絵を見たかったら僕を訪ねていらっしゃい。白昼堂々と、お日様がカンカン照っている下で、穴が開くほど見せてあげますよ。
なぜかってですか？ 写真の方は、夏の大相撲の立ち合い実況の絵葉書ですし、絵の方はですね、芝居の『弁天小僧菊之助』が浜松屋の店先でゆすっている絵ですからね。
全く怖い所ですよ、松島という所は昔から……。

**【コラム：便所のらくがき】**
「落書き」は一つの人生の伴侶のようなものらしい。人間が手に筆を持つ年頃、四、五歳になると鉛筆の芯をなめて、紙に向かって、馬だの、ワンワン（犬）だのと言って、訳もわからないものを書きなぐる。
小学校の一年生にもなれば、ガキ同士の悪口を書く。そうして追々大人に至るまで、色々な形式で落書きを続けてゆく。
どうして人間が落書きをするかという問題は、それが人間感情の動機である以上、自分の気持ちに何かしらわだかまりが存在しているからだ。それを晴らそうとする際、友に語るも、妻に語るも、その吐露すべき場所がない時、先人も言ったように「物言わねば腹膨るる（言いたいことを言わないと不満が溜まる）」わざであり、実に落書きこそ心の中の昂ぶりを簡単に放言できるものであるからである。
したがって落書きは、決して名文句もいらないし、思考推敲の必要もない。極めて瞬間的な気持ちで書けばよいのである。共同便所の壁に極めて拙劣な文句で書き散らされる卑猥極まる落書きには困ったものだが、あれも「性の告白」と解釈するのも妙だが、一種の開放的な自慰行為と見るべきではなかろうか。それが婦人便所に多いのも一つの趣向と見られるからである。
ある収集マニアが落書きを丹念に写し取って歩いた報告によると、ある植物園の便所に「落書きは瞬間的芸術なり」と記してあったそうだ。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Main Story]**
It is the Kawaguchi Settlement where there are many bridge trading houses.
This entire area was supposed to be a weed-overgrown scorched field, but it seems sex appeal and appetite cannot be removed from humans; despite being barracks, bars, eateries, and the problematic "special cafes" are standing side-by-side [pushing and shoving], and I was surprised at a prosperity greater than the old Matsushima.
Of course, the brave and daring customer-snatching battle of the various waitresses does not betray the tradition of the once-famed Matsushima pleasure quarters. If a women's rugby team were formed, the Matsushima team's victory would be without doubt!
While nimbly dodging the tackles of that fierce group of women and walking along, from behind me, before I knew it, a single man was following.
"Boss, boss, [I have] good ones."
When reaching a dim alley, that man spun around and blocked my path.
"Please step over here a moment; if found by the police, it's annoying [troublesome]."
The man pulled me under the eaves of a tobacco shop.
"What is it? Are you going to take care of [finding me] a good 'ball' [woman]?"
"Well now, if the boss asks, I'll take care of any number [of them], but I am not a pimp."
"Hmm, then what?"
"It's this, boss!"
Gazing sharply around, and seeing there were no people, the man quickly took out five or six postcards from a bag he held in his arms and,
"They are the real thing, they are a bit expensive,"
he said, flipping through them. In the faint lamplight I couldn't tell clearly, but I saw glimpses of white body and body, arm and arm, leg and leg entwined.
"How about it... decide quickly. Five hundred yen for five, they sell well. The woman is a movie actress just now debuting..."
"..."
"Yeah, that's right."
"Ah."
"Wait, if such a find isn't to your liking, it can't be helped. I'll add one more top-quality drawing too, look..."
This time, what he let me glimpse was, on the bottom half of a piece of paper, a white leg sitting cross-legged, and a bright red cloth tightening suggestively.
"Five photos and one hand-drawn picture, five hundred yen for this! You won't find it elsewhere, boss!"
I silently pulled out five 100-yen bills from my dollar-pouch and pressed them into the man's hand.
"Heh, thanks..."
The man stuffed the photos and drawing into my coat pocket and disappeared into the dark darkness like a fleeing rabbit.
...So, readers, if you definitely want to see these photos and the drawing, please come visit me. I will show them to you in broad daylight, right under the blazing sun, until you burn holes in them with your eyes.
Why is that? Because the photos are postcards of the actual opening bouts of the summer Grand Sumo tournament, and the drawing is of the play character Benten Kozo Kikunosuke extorting money at the storefront of Hamamatsu-ya.
It really is a scary place, Matsushima has been since long ago...

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**The Old Shell Game in Matsushima**
I found myself in the Kawaguchi Settlement, an area once crowded with trading firms. Not long ago, this entire district was nothing but a scorched wasteland of weeds. But apparently, human nature—driven by lust and hunger—is a force that cannot be suppressed. Amidst the makeshift barracks, a chaotic row of bars, diners, and those dubious "special tea houses" had sprung up, bustling with a rowdiness that surpassed even the Matsushima of old.

The waitresses here are fierce. Their relentless, aggressive scramble for customers lives up to the notorious reputation of the historic Matsushima pleasure quarters. If they ever formed a women’s rugby league, the Matsushima team would undoubtedly take the championship trophy.

As I nimbly dodged the "tackles" of these predatory women, I realized a man had been tailing me. 
"Hey, Boss! Hey, Captain! I’ve got the good stuff," he hissed.
As we hit a dim alleyway, he cut in front of me, blocking my path. "Step over here, would you? It’s a real headache if the cops spot us." He pulled me under the eaves of a closed tobacco shop.

"What is it?" I asked. "Looking to set me up with a 'choice piece'?"
"Now, Boss, if that's what you're after, I can find you as many as you like. But I’m no common pimp."
"Oh? Then what are you?"
"It's *this*, Boss!"
He scanned the street. Once he was sure we were alone, he whipped a stack of five or six postcards out of his bag. "These are the real deal. A bit pricey, mind you."

He fanned them out quickly. In the flickering shadows, I couldn't see the details, but I caught glimpses of pale flesh—arms, legs, and bodies all tangled together. 
"Well? Make up your mind fast. Five hundred yen for the set of five. They're flying off the shelves. The girl is a starlet who just made her debut..."
I stayed silent.
"Come on, Boss. You know you want 'em."
"Ah..."
"Wait, if these aren't your style, I’ll tell you what. I’ll throw in a top-shelf hand-drawn original too. Look at this..."
This time, he showed me the bottom of a sheet of paper: a pale, cross-legged thigh wrapped in a provocative flash of crimson silk.
"Five photos and a sketch, all for five hundred! You won't get a deal like this anywhere else!"

Without a word, I pulled five 100-yen bills from my wallet and shoved them into his hand.
"Heh, much obliged..."
He stuffed the bundle into my coat pocket and bolted into the shadows like a rabbit.

Now, dear readers, if you’re dying to see these "naughty" pictures, feel free to drop by. I’ll show them to you in the middle of the day, under the glaring sun, for as long as you care to stare. 
Why, you ask? Because the "scandalous" photos are actually postcards of the opening ceremonies of the summer Sumo tournament. And that "provocative" drawing? It’s a scene from a Kabuki play: Benten Kozo Kikunosuke performing a shakedown at the Hamamatsu-ya shop.
Matsushima is a terrifying place—and it’s been that way for a long, long time.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is structured into three main visual zones:
    1.  **Top/Left Text:** Narrative fiction written in a pulp/detective style. It uses dialogue-heavy columns.
    2.  **Illustration (Center):** A cartoonish, slightly eroticized sketch illustrating the story. It shows the man in the trench coat inspecting the photos while the shady tout grins. The "nude" in the photo is drawn with minimal lines to suggest a body without being explicit.
    3.  **Bottom Right Column:** A non-fiction essay titled "便所のらくがき" (Bathroom Graffiti). It is physically separated from the main story, functioning as a "filler" or secondary interest piece.
*   **Typography:** The text is set in a traditional vertical arrangement (*tategaki*). The font is a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century magazines.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The title of the essay is bolded and set in a larger point size within its own box. The main story lacks a formal title at the top of this specific page, suggesting it might be a continuation of a story from the previous page or part of a regular column.
*   **Artifacts:** The paper shows significant yellowing and some bleed-through from the reverse side, typical of low-quality "pulp" magazines from the late 1940s or early 1950s (*Kasutori* magazines).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Matsushima (松島):** Located in Nishi-ku, Osaka, Matsushima was one of the major licensed pleasure quarters (*Yukaku*). After being destroyed in WWII firebombing, it was rebuilt. Prostitution became technically illegal, so brothels operated as "Special Tea Houses" (*Tokushu Kissa*). 
*   **Post-War "Burned-out Fields" (焼野原):** The text mentions "Yakenohara" and "Barracks." This placing the setting firmly in the late 1940s to early 1950s, during the Reconstruction period when people lived in temporary structures.
*   **Special Tea Houses (特殊喫茶):** A euphemism for brothels where waitresses (接客婦) provided sexual services. The "rugby" metaphor describes the aggressive way these women would physically grab potential customers from the street.
*   **Benten Kozo Kikunosuke:** A famous character from the Kabuki play *Shiranami Gonin Otoko*. He is a cross-dressing thief. The "white leg and red cloth" the narrator saw was actually the character's kimono, not a nude woman.
*   **Currency:** The narrator pulls money from a "dollar-holder" (*doru-ire*), reflecting the influence of the US Occupation and the high value of foreign currency/black market dealings. 500 yen was a significant amount for a set of postcards in the early 1950s.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ええべ (Ee-be):** Dialectal/Slang. A contraction/variation of "Ii mono da" (It's a good thing).
*   **ポン引 (Pon-biki):** A pimp or tout who lures customers to brothels.
*   **タマ (Tama):** Literally "ball/gem," but used here as slang for a woman/prostitute.
*   **脱兎の如く (Datto no gotoku):** "Like a fleeing rabbit." An idiom meaning to run away very fast.
*   **物言わねば腹ふくるる (Mono iwaneba hara fukururu):** A classical Japanese proverb meaning "If you don't say what's on your mind, your stomach swells [with frustration]." It justifies the act of venting through graffiti.
*   **なめ〜 (Name~):** The tilde indicates a lingering sound. Children used to lick the tips of pencils to make the lead write darker/smoother.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Gullibility vs. Cynicism:** The narrator considers himself savvy, dodging "tackles" from waitresses, yet falls for a classic bait-and-switch. This is a common trope in *Kasutori* (pulp) literature: the "city slicker" getting conned.
*   **Eroticism and Censorship:** The story plays with the reader's expectations of erotica. The "smut" turns out to be cultural artifacts (Sumo and Kabuki). This was likely a humorous way to navigate strict post-war obscenity laws while still providing "titillation" through the setup.
*   **The Human Condition (Graffiti):** The essay on graffiti presents a proto-psychological view of the act as a necessary emotional release. It frames even "lewd" graffiti as a form of "sexual confession" or "masturbatory act," showing a surprisingly modern, non-judgmental take on social psychology.
*   **Survival in the Ruins:** The setting describes a vibrant economy rising from the ashes of war, driven by basic human desires ("color/sex" and "food").

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Short Story), Essay (Column).
*   **Genre:** Pulp/Hardboiled Satire, Social Commentary.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Red-light district, Scams, Prostitution, Black Market, Psychology of Graffiti, Osaka.
*   **Era:** Showa Era (approx. 1948–1955).
