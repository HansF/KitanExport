## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Time having passed, she immediately to the Public Prosecutor’s Office as a major criminal was transferred.
The assigned prosecutor was Haruko-san’s lover and also, as a young intellectual chief prosecutor, of high reputation, Prosecutor Kamogawa. He also recognized Toshiko’s guilt, and after one day of prosecutorial detention passed, [she] was moved to the hands of a judge, and in the Kyoto Detention House as an unconvicted prisoner was incarcerated.
Already entering September, one day, regarding Sakai Toshiko’s murder suspect case, the first public trial was to be opened, but she a lawyer also did not appoint, and an official court-appointed defense lawyer would stand, it was said.
"Haruko-chan, actually, I also a bit am weakening [at a loss] about something," said Prosecutor Kamogawa.
"Oh, even you have times when you are at a loss?"
"Don’t strangle my neck with silk floss [don't pressure me subtly]. Even I, when time to weaken comes, weaken. However, woman is woman-comrade, that being a thing, you, one more time interrogation do for me, I wonder?"
"Who?"
"Sakai Toshiko, that doctor-killing nurse. As you also know, the thing called Criminal Procedure Law Article 336, it specifies that judgment is based on evidence, but the judge’s saying is, circumstantial evidence is sufficient, but whether there is definitive corroborating evidence, he says. So again, having brought her out and repeatedly investigated, to the end crime’s admission she does not do, and whatever [one] asks, only crying, entirely does not become a conversation."
"Well, anyway, that person once meet please let me."
Haruko gradually interest began to feel, it seemed.
Eventually from the prison cell she was pulled out and came. Hair oil-less, face white-powder-essence lost, that prison garb even more painfully emaciated, sorrow’s color was deep, but yet innocence’s shadow had not vanished. Slender and graceful, this girl, a murderer etc., no matter how [one] thinks, cannot believe degree it was.
"You, why the hospital director etc. did you kill?"
Haruko, with a warm gaze while capturing her, so saying, that woman "startled" like, complexion moved, but:
"The criminal is not me," she with a vanishing-like voice said.
"Eh? You not the criminal, you say? Then, why to such a place did [you] come?"
"The police people took me of their own accord. No matter how much I excuse myself, nobody believes, so I a heavy crime am made to wear. I Japan’s law resent. If I the truth say, and by that death penalty happens, becoming [it] I don’t mind. From now in the future, people who meet the same fate if only they do not appear, just, only that it is."
She, something thinking-thinking, "plop" [muttered] said. Meanwhile the prosecutor, with a slightly tense appearance, looked at Haruko. If this statement is true, the case will suddenly reverse, and that itself, an outrageous thing will become, because it is.
"Then, other than you, someone Ikuo-kun was able to kill, [you] say, right?"
"Such a thing even I do not know. Such a thing is something for the police to investigate, is it not?"

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

As time ticked by, she was swiftly transferred to the Public Prosecutor’s Office as a high-profile suspect. The prosecutor assigned to her case was none other than Prosecutor Kamogawa—Haruko’s lover and a brilliant young legal mind with a sterling reputation. Kamogawa himself was convinced of Toshiko's guilt; following a single day of prosecutorial detention, she was handed over to a judge and remanded to the Kyoto Detention House as an unconvicted prisoner.

One day in early September, as the first hearing for the Sakai Toshiko murder case approached, it was learned that she had refused to appoint her own counsel, leaving her with a court-appointed lawyer.

"Haruko-chan, to tell you the truth, I’m a bit at my wit's end," Prosecutor Kamogawa confessed.

"My, even you have your moments of weakness?" Haruko teased.

"Now, don't go strangling me with a silk cord," he replied, referring to her gentle but persistent prodding. "Even I have my limits. But look, woman to woman, I was wondering... would you mind interrogating her one more time for me?"

"Who? You mean Toshiko?"

"Yes, Sakai Toshiko—the nurse who supposedly killed the doctor. As you know, Article 336 of the Code of Criminal Procedure dictates that a verdict must be based on evidence. The judge says that while the circumstantial evidence is plenty, there’s no 'smoking gun.' I’ve brought her in for questioning time and again, but she refuses to confess. No matter what I ask, she just cries. It’s impossible to get a word out of her."

"Well," Haruko said, her curiosity piqued, "at least let me meet her once."

Before long, Toshiko was led out of her cell. Her hair was dry and unkempt, and her face, devoid of its usual powder, looked ghostly. In her prison garments, she appeared painfully haggard, a deep shroud of sorrow clinging to her. Yet, the traces of her innate innocence had not yet vanished. She looked so delicate and graceful that it seemed impossible to believe this girl was a cold-blooded killer.

"Why did you do it?" Haruko asked, her voice warm as she held the girl’s gaze. "Why did you kill the hospital director?"

The woman flinched, her complexion shifting. "I didn't do it," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

"What? You aren't the killer? Then why are you in a place like this?"

"The police just took me away against my will," Toshiko replied, her words coming in slow, deliberate drops. "No matter how I plead my innocence, no one believes me. They're forcing this heavy crime upon me. I've come to resent the laws of this country. If telling the truth means I must face the death penalty, then so be it. I only wish that, in the future, no one else has to suffer what I am suffering now."

The prosecutor watched Haruko with a tense expression. If this statement held even a grain of truth, the entire case was about to be turned on its head—an outcome with staggering implications.

"So," he pressed, "are you saying someone other than yourself could have killed Ikuo?"

"I wouldn't know anything about that," she retorted. "Isn't investigating such things exactly what the police are for?"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

### Format and Layout
*   **Vertical Orientation:** Typical of Japanese literary publications, text flows from top-to-bottom and right-to-left.
*   **Column Structure:** The page is divided into two main horizontal tiers, with the text wrapped around a central illustration.
*   **Illustration:** A line-art drawing occupies the center-right. It depicts a man (Kamogawa) and a woman (Haruko) in a Western-style interior, with a cross-like window or architectural element behind them, suggesting the somber atmosphere of a courthouse or detention center. The signature "玲子え" (Drawn by Reiko) is visible.
*   **Pagination:** The number (101) is centered at the bottom, indicating this is part of a larger magazine or book.

### Typography
*   **Typeface:** A classic Mincho style, common in mid-century printing.
*   **Orthography:** The text uses a mix of *kyūjitai* (older kanji forms like 檢察廳, 戀人, 智腦) and *shinjitai* (modern forms). Small *tsu* (っ) is often printed full-size (つ), which was standard in older typesetting.
*   **Punctuation:** Quotation marks (「 」) and commas (、) follow standard Japanese conventions, though the "!!" or "ア" at the end of sentences reflects a more dramatic, pulp-fiction style.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s to early 1950s (Showa 20s). This is evidenced by the use of older kanji and the specific legal terminology from the post-war legal reforms.
*   **Legal System:** The text mentions "Criminal Procedure Law Article 336" (刑事訴訟法三三六條). In the post-war Japanese legal system, this article emphasizes the necessity of evidence for a conviction. The mention of "court-appointed defense" (官選辯護人 - *kansen bengonin*) reflects the constitutional right to counsel established in the 1947 Constitution.
*   **Social Roles:** The character Haruko acts as a "detective's assistant" or "consultant" to her lover, the prosecutor. This reflects a common trope in mid-century "soft" mystery stories where a female protagonist uses "intuition" or "womanly empathy" to solve cases that stymie male authorities.
*   **Setting:** Kyoto (mentioned via "Kyoto Detention House"). Kyoto often served as a romanticized or atmospheric backdrop for mysteries in this era.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **眞綿で首しめる (Mawata de kubi o shimeru):** Literally "to strangle someone with silk floss." An idiom meaning to pressure or torment someone in a soft, indirect, but persistent and painful way.
*   **楚々とした (Soso to shita):** Describes a woman who is graceful, slender, and neat. It implies a refined, fragile beauty.
*   **智腦 (Chinō/Chino):** An older way of writing "intellectual capacity" or "brainpower." Here used as "young intellectual/brilliant."
*   **油氣 (Aburake):** "Oiliness." Referring to the lack of hair oil/care, signifying the suspect's distraught state and the harsh conditions of detention.
*   **白粉氣 (Oshiroike):** "Powder-essence." Referring to makeup. Its absence signifies her natural (and haggard) state in prison.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Conflict of Interest:** The prosecutor is the lover of the woman he asks to help interrogate the suspect. This blurs the line between personal life and legal procedure, a hallmark of "pulp" melodrama.
*   **The Tragic Heroine:** Toshiko is framed as a "fallen angel"—a nurse accused of a heinous crime who looks too innocent to have committed it. This creates suspense: is she a brilliant actress or a victim of a miscarriage of justice?
*   **Institutional Resentment:** Toshiko’s line about "hating Japan's laws" reflects a post-war skepticism toward authority and the fallibility of the legal system during a time of massive social transition.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** Kamogawa asks Haruko to help because "women understand women." This relies on the gendered assumption that female suspects will open up to female interrogators through emotional connection rather than legal logic.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Mystery (Suiri Shōsetsu), Melodrama.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Crime, Courtroom Drama, Romance, Miscarriage of Justice, 1950s Japan, Female Suspect.
*   **Classification:** Adult fiction (General audience).
