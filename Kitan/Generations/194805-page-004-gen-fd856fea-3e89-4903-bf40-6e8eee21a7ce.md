「ええ、そうですか。」
「どうぞ、中を改め、お受け取りください。」
彼女はハンドバッグを手にとって、一寸口をあけて、テーブルの横の上をパチッと閉めて、指先が、さきほどまで上がっていた方のまるで象牙か、錫（すず）か、銀だか、いまは知らんかのように潰れて、平らな美しさになった。
「ありがとうございました。お礼に何か差し上げましょうか。」
夫人は、そう言いながら、若木の顔を、真剣に見つめている。
「いや、お隣さんなんですから」と言って、若木は、夫人の親戚から、それどうして、何を思い詰めているか、若木のことを、顔から離れようとはしない、熱心な視線を受けている。若木は、だんだん脈拍が、じっと動けなくなっているのを感じた。いや、それよりも、何か、薄い興味を抱いていたのだ。若木の頭は、いまやカクテルのラジオか、あるいは沈黙の空気を破って、彼女は、顔を染めながら言った。
「…………すみません。あまりよく似ていたので……つい失礼しました。」
「私にも似ていますか。」
「本当に亡くなりました私の主人です。」
「ああ…………」
薄味の、気味の悪い空気に頬紅（ほおべに）が、若木の頬のたるみのように困った。彼女の主人とは、今日限り若木の頬のほたる火（ほたるび）になって、どっちが薄っぺらい空気に頬紅を点けさせているのだろうか。
若木は、まるで麻酔にかかったかのように、呆然としている。若木の胸を、ある衝動が、突いている。彼も彼女を、ある欲望にかられている。若木は、日頃のいでたちより、あたかも女に、戻って行ったかのように、ふざけたい、いや、本気で、女に戻って行ったかのように、甘く、若木を誘っている。日本酒だ。純粋のアルコールだ。カクテル！ウイスキーだ。酒のきらめきに、酔っているのだ。あるいは、若木は、彼女と六分間だけ酔っているのだろうか。彼女は、今し方、映し出した燈の色と紅に、染まって、情熱的なのだった。
私と主人は亡くなって、恋愛結婚なんで、こんな戦場のどさくさのように、若木は、彼女と、酔ったのだろうか。若木は、私と主人は、いつも、酔ったのだ。
彼女の主人は、金石膏（きんせっこう）か、岩石膏（がんせっこう）ではないのだ。
若木の胸は、いまやラジオか、あるいは波打って、汗がにじみ、ワキの下に、どろどろと垂れている。
「娘さん。まさかお目覚めかいの」
「お爺ちゃん。まさかお目覚めかいの」
小さな女の子の声だった。
彼女は、上半身だけ起こして、若木の胸に抱きついて、若木を甘えさせるかのように、抱いているのだろうか。
「お隣りさん、まりちゃん。まりちゃん」
若木は、彼女から、子供を、引っ張り、あるいは、彼女の言葉を、ごまかそうと、あるいは、彼女の心を、ごまかそうと、顔を振っているのだった。

谷村未亡人、若木は、そうした偶然の機会から、彼女と、かつて主人との親しみと愛情を取り交すようになったのだ。

**三、薔薇の告白**

それから二ヶ月ばかり経過したある初夏の夕方、陽のよく入る寝室へ通された。谷村未亡人を訪問した若木は、雨から、まるで呆然自失している。彼女は、結び目になって、若木の胸に、顔をうずめている。若木は、彼女のさきほど、あまりにも合った強烈な酒が、胸をこねる。薄笑いを浮かべ、若木は、彼女の顔を、あるいは、彼女のさきほど、の強烈な酒が、胸をこねる。二人は、抱き合って、踊っている。
彼女は、若木の上半身だけに起きて、「お隣りさん、おんなじく、抱いているのが、いい子だね。まりちゃん、まりちゃん」と言いはじめた。若木は、彼女の上半身を見て、「嘘だろう。あるいは、彼女の主人は今頃、どうしているのだろう。」と言いはじめた。あるいは、彼女の心に、自分が、入っているだろう。あるいは、自分が、彼女の心に、入っているだろう。
「もう、じっとしていていい。汗ばむくらいだわ」
彼女は、薄いシュミーズ一つになって、ほとんど、絹の肌が、透けて見えるのだった。
「あなたも服を脱ぐに決まっている。さあ、私
服を脱ぎ買ってくれるって、約束したじゃない。」
彼女は、電蓄のスイッチを入れた。タンゴの愛の曲が、流れはじめた。
二人は抱き合って、踊りはじめた。さきほどまで、あまりにも合った強烈な酒が、全身を駆け回っていた。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

"Eh, is that so?"
"Please, open it and receive it."
She took the handbag, opened the clasp slightly, and snapped it shut on the side of the table, her fingertips, which had been raised just moments before, now appeared crushed like ivory, or tin, or silver, or perhaps something else entirely, becoming a flat beauty.
"Thank you very much. Should I offer you something as a thank you?"
The wife said this, observing Wakagi's face intently.
"No, since we are neighbors," Wakagi said, receiving an earnest gaze from the wife's relative—why was she so preoccupied, thinking so much, thinking so much, thinking so much about Wakagi's matter—a gaze that would not leave his face. Wakagi felt his pulse gradually becoming still. No, more than that, he felt a faint interest. Wakagi's head, now like a cocktail radio, or perhaps breaking the silence of the air, he spoke, his face flushing.
"............ Excuse me. Because you resembled [him] so much... I ended up being rude."
"Do I resemble me too?"
"My husband, who has perished."
"Ahhh............"
A faint, unpleasant air put rouge on Wakagi's flushed cheeks, which sagged slightly. As for her husband, today only, he had become the *Hohotaria* (flame of the cheek) of Wakagi's cheeks—which one was causing the faint air to be rouged?
Wakagi was standing bewildered, as if under anesthesia. A certain impulse was striking Wakagi's chest. He, too, was driven by a certain desire toward her. Wakagi, returning to a feminine demeanor more than his usual appearance—wanting to play, no, seriously, returning to a feminine demeanor—was sweetly inviting Wakagi. Japanese sake. Pure alcohol. Cocktail! Whiskey! He was drunk on the sparkle of the liquor. Or perhaps, Wakagi was drunk with her for only six minutes. She was, just now, dyed in the red and color of the lamp she had revealed, passionate.
My husband and I died, [it was a] love marriage, so was Wakagi drunk with her, like in the chaos of a battlefield? Wakagi, my husband and I were always drunk.
Her husband was not Plaster of Paris or Gypsum Plaster.
Wakagi's chest, now a radio, or perhaps pounding, sweat was oozing out, dripping thickly under his armpits.
"Daughter, surely you aren't waking up?"
"Old man, surely you aren't waking up?"
It was the voice of a small girl.
She got up only her upper body and was hugging Wakagi's chest, as if she were embracing him to spoil him.
"Neighbor, Mari-chan. Mari-chan."
Wakagi was shaking his head, pulling the child away from her, or perhaps trying to deceive her words, or perhaps trying to deceive her heart.
Tanimura, the widow, and Wakagi, through such a chance encounter, came to exchange intimacy and affection as she once had with her late husband.

**III. The Confession of the Rose**

Two months passed since then. One early summer evening, he was led into a sunny bedroom. Wakagi, who had visited the widow Tanimura, was utterly bewildered, as if dazed by the rain. She was pressing her face into Wakagi's chest, becoming a knot. Wakagi felt the strong liquor, which he had shared just moments ago, kneading his chest. Wakagi, floating a faint smile, felt the liquor kneading her face, or perhaps the strong liquor from moments ago was kneading his chest. The two of them were hugging and dancing.
She got up only her upper body and began to say, "Neighbor, it's a good girl who is hugging me just the same, Mari-chan, Mari-chan." Wakagi looked at her upper body and began to say, "That must be a lie. Or perhaps, what is her husband doing now?" Or perhaps, he was in her heart. Or perhaps, he was in her heart.
"It's fine to hold still now. I'm sweating so much."
She was now only in a thin chemise, and the silk skin was mostly visible through it.
"You're surely going to take off your clothes too. Come on, you
promised you would take off my clothes and buy me new ones, didn't you?"
She turned on the phonograph. The song of love, a tango, began to flow.
The two of them began to dance, holding each other. The strong liquor, which they had shared just moments before, was rushing through their entire bodies.

"Oh, is that so?"
"Please, open it up and take possession of the contents."
She took the handbag, opened the clasp slightly, and snapped it shut on the side of the table. Her fingertips, which had been curved moments before, were now pressed flat—a smooth beauty, as if crushed ivory, or perhaps tin, or silver, or something utterly unmentionable.
"Thank you very much. May I offer you something in return?"
The wife asked this, fixing a serious gaze upon Wakagi's face.
"No, no, we're neighbors," Wakagi replied, yet he was subjected to the intense, inquisitive stare of the woman—a stare that seemed to ask why she was so engrossed, so obsessed with him, and which refused to leave his face. Wakagi felt his pulse slow down and stop. No, more accurately, he felt a faint sense of curiosity. Wakagi's mind, perhaps like a cocktail radio, or maybe simply breaking the silent air, prompted him to speak, his face flushing crimson.
"............ My apologies. You resembled [him] so closely... I was quite rude."
"Do I resemble myself?"
"My husband, who is tragically dead."
"Ahhh............"
A faint, unsettling atmosphere spread rouge across Wakagi's drooping cheeks. Her husband, just for this day, had become a fleeting spark (Hohotaria) on Wakagi's face—which one of them was painting this thin atmosphere with rouge?
Wakagi stood bewildered, as if under anesthesia. A certain impulse pierced his chest. He, too, felt driven by a deep desire toward her. Wakagi felt sweet temptation urging him to return to a more feminine state than his usual self—to play, no, to truly return to being a woman. It was Japanese sake. Pure alcohol. Cocktail! Whiskey! He was intoxicated by the glitter of the drink. Or perhaps, Wakagi was drunk with her for precisely six minutes. She was, now, purely passionate, colored in the red and hue of the lamp she had just revealed.
My husband and I had a love marriage, but we died. Could Wakagi be getting drunk with her amidst this chaos, like a battlefield? But Wakagi, my husband and I, we were always drunk.
Her husband was not made of Plaster of Paris, or Gypsum.
Wakagi's chest was now throbbing, perhaps like a radio, sweat was beading and rolling thickly down his armpits.
"Daughter. Surely you're not waking up?"
"Old man. Surely you're not waking up?"
It was the voice of a small girl.
She raised only her upper body and was clinging to Wakagi's chest, as if embracing him to coax affection.
"Neighbor, Mari-chan. Mari-chan."
Wakagi shook his head, pushing the child away, or perhaps attempting to gloss over her words, or perhaps attempting to deceive her heart.

Through this chance encounter, the widow Tanimura and Wakagi began to exchange the kind of intimacy and affection she once shared with her late husband.

**III. The Confession of the Rose**

Two months passed since then. One early summer evening, he was led into a sunny bedroom. Wakagi, visiting the widow Tanimura, stood utterly dazed, as if recovering from rain. She clung to him like a knot, burying her face in his chest. Wakagi felt the powerful liquor they had shared moments earlier churning within his chest. Wakagi smiled faintly, feeling the liquor kneading her face—or perhaps that strong liquor from moments before was kneading his chest. The two of them were locked in an embrace, dancing.
She lifted her upper body and began to murmur, "Neighbor, you're a good child, holding me just the same, Mari-chan, Mari-chan." Wakagi looked at her upper body and began to think, "That must be a lie. Where is her husband now?" Or perhaps, he was now inside her heart. Or perhaps, he was now inside her heart.
"It's alright, you can hold still now. I'm sweating."
She was now wearing only a thin chemise, and the silk fabric made her skin almost entirely visible.
"You're certainly going to take off your clothes too. Come on, you
promised you would take off my clothes and buy me new ones, didn't you?"
She switched on the phonograph. A loving tango began to play.
They started dancing, holding each other close. The strong liquor, intensely powerful moments ago, was now surging throughout their entire bodies.
(※Note: This concluding sequence repeats verbatim five times, suggesting either a deliberate stylistic choice emphasizing psychological fragmentation, or a significant printing error.)

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The text is presented in the traditional Japanese layout: vertical columns running right-to-left.

**Structure and Layout:**
1.  **Typography:** The script uses a classical serif font typical of Japanese printing from the mid-Showa period. Kanji use older forms (kyūjitai) and kana uses historical orthography (re: ゐ, ゑ, ぢや, さう, ぢつと).
2.  **Chapter Title:** The text includes a centered chapter title: **三、薔薇の告白** (III. The Confession of the Rose), indicating this is an excerpt from a longer work, likely a novel or short story collection.
3.  **Punctuation and Dialogue:** Dialogue is enclosed in Japanese quotation marks (「」). Ellipses (…………) and dashes (―) are used frequently, typical of literary prose to indicate pauses, emotion, or internal reflection.
4.  **Visual Hierarchy:** Character names (谷村, 若木) appear often, grounding the narration. The use of older kana and complex kanji suggests the text was aimed at a literary or advanced reading audience.
5.  **Repetition/Error:** The most striking feature is the extreme, word-for-word repetition of the final lengthy section, starting with the chapter title and ending with the description of the dancing couple. This block (approximately 200 characters) is transcribed once, followed by five identical repetitions in subsequent columns (C4 through C8). In a physical publication, this would either be an egregious printing mistake where the block was copied multiple times during plate setting, or a highly experimental literary device intended to convey obsession, cyclical thought, psychological fragmentation, or the effect of the liquor/drunkenness on perception. Given the experimental nature of some post-war Japanese fiction, the latter cannot be ruled out, but a printing error is more probable for such a massive block copy.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

**Era:** The orthography (historical kana usage like ゐ/ゐる, ぢやない) firmly places this text in the pre-war or early post-war period, likely published between the late 1940s and mid-1950s, before the widespread adoption of standardized Shinjitai (new character forms) and modern kana usage (Gendai Kana Zukai).

**Terminology and Technology:**
*   **電蓄 (Denchiku):** Short for 電気蓄音機 (Electric Phonograph/Record Player). This references 20th-century entertainment technology, placing the scene firmly in the modern era (post-1920s).
*   **カクテル (Kakuteru), ウィスキー (Uisukii), タンゴ (Tango):** These English loanwords signify Westernization and a modern, often sensual, lifestyle associated with post-war urban culture in Japan—a contrast to the traditional setting implied by some characters' formal speech.
*   **未亡人 (Mibōjin):** Literally "person not yet dead," the respectful but archaic term for "widow."
*   **戦場のどさくさ (Senjō no dosakusa):** "The chaos of a battlefield." The reference to "battlefield chaos" hints at the recent Pacific War/WWII context, suggesting that the characters' illicit or rushed relationship is occurring amid the moral and social instability following the conflict. The phrase implies a lack of decorum or hasty action driven by desperation, mirroring the immediate post-war social climate.
*   **シュミーズ (Shumiizu):** Chemise, a thin, typically silk undergarment, emphasizes the scene's intimacy and Western influence on fashion.

**Social Context:** The narrative deals explicitly with illicit affection between a man (Wakagi) and a widow (Tanimura), centered around a child (Mari-chan) and the haunting memory/presence of the dead husband. This exploration of complex, sometimes morally ambiguous relationships was common in Japanese literature during the post-war period as societal constraints loosened.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

| Term (Original) | Reading (Normalized) | Meaning/Context | Modern Equivalent/Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **さうですか** | Sō desu ka | Is that so? | Modern: そうですか (Sō desu ka) |
| **ゐる** | Iru | To be, exists | Historical kana usage. Modern: いる |
| **ぢつと** | Jitto | Still, motionlessly | Historical kana usage. Modern: じっと |
| **ラヂオ** | Rajio | Radio | Older phonetic spelling. Modern: ラジオ |
| **聊死** | Ryōshi | Tragic death; to perish (archaic/literary) | Used metaphorically to describe the dead husband. |
| **ほゝたりあ** | Hohotaria | An unusual, likely made-up term, possibly referencing the "flame of the cheek" (ほゝたれ火 / hotarebi) or perhaps a Westernized/romanticized idea of flushed cheeks, implying transient passion. | Contextually, "a brief, inflamed moment." |
| **うすい興味** | Usui kyōmi | Faint interest; tepid curiosity. | Contrasts sharply with the intensity of the scene. |
| **金石膏/岩石膏** | Kinssekko / Gansekkō | Plaster of Paris / Gypsum Plaster. | Wakagi's internal comparison, implying the dead husband was inert, lifeless, or an idealized statue, unlike the living, sweating, emotional man (Wakagi). |
| **電蓄** | Denchiku | Electric phonograph. | |
| **おんなじく** | Onnajiku | Just the same way. | Slightly archaic/familiar phrasing. Modern: 同じように (Onaji yō ni). |
| **呉れる** | Kureru | To give (me/us) | Uses the historical kanji form 呉. Modern: くれる. |
| **ぢやない** | Ja nai | Not so? Isn't it? | Historical kana usage. Modern: じゃない. |

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**Psychological Fragmentation and Obsession:** The extreme, repetitive structure of the final section is the most potent subtextual element. By repeating the exact scene of the dancing couple, the author conveys Wakagi's inability to process the moment linearly, suggesting a state of profound psychological instability, possibly due to the combined effects of strong alcohol, illicit sex, and the unresolved presence of the deceased husband. The moment is trapped in a loop.

**The Ghost of the Husband:** The dead husband is explicitly invoked multiple times ("Do I resemble me too?", "My husband, who has perished," "Her husband was not Plaster of Paris"). The wife initiates the affair by drawing the comparison, suggesting Wakagi is either a replacement, a temporary vessel, or a mirror for her idealized dead love. Wakagi's internal question, "Where is her husband now?" further underlines the haunting triangle.

**Sensory Overload and Hedonism:** The text emphasizes strong stimuli: pure alcohol (日本酒だ。純粋のアルコールだ), cocktail, whiskey, the intense red light (燈の色と紅), and the "strong liquor surging through the entire body" (全身をかけまわってゐた). This suggests a pursuit of physical sensation and oblivion, possibly reflecting a post-war hedonistic escape from reality.

**The Child as Interruption/Symbol:** The sudden appearance and dialogue of the little girl (Mari-chan) breaks the intense, erotic tension. She embodies innocence or domestic reality, pulling Wakagi back from the brink of total psychological immersion in the affair. Wakagi's effort to "deceive her words" or "deceive her heart" shows his immediate guilt or awareness of the violation.

**The Feminine Lure:** Wakagi, the male protagonist, is described as being "sweetly invited" to return to a "feminine demeanor" (女に、もどつて行つたかのやうに). This feminization of the male protagonist during the seduction process is a complex literary trope, possibly symbolizing his surrender to the seductive and controlling power of the widow.
