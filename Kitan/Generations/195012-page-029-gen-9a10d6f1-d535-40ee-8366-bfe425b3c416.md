This image is a page from a Japanese "Kasutori" magazine (sensationalist pulp magazines popular in the immediate post-WWII era, roughly 1946–1952). It features two distinct pieces of writing: a satirical narrative about a shady businessman creating a knock-off "Coca-Cola" and a gritty, naturalist memoir installment about the visceral realities of Siberian labor camps.

何でも目先の早いのが取り柄――河内の知人のラムネ工場を買収して忽ち社長に収まると、『リーダーズ・ダイジェスト』に載っている製造法を鵜呑みにして作り上げさせたら、どうやらよく似たものが出来上がった。

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

**[Main Text]**
"Ge, my keeping of a mistress is no-money-needed. On the contrary, [she] earns for me," [he] boasted to people he met, and the Sex Store and marriage mediation were completely left to caretakers; this was at a stand run by a young "Number Three" (mistress) behind the Sennichimae Kabuki, sipping [drinks].
"Hmm, quite a strange drink. What do you call it, Yoshiko?"
This was formerly Genkichi's secretary; looking at her, one couldn't believe she was that quiet Yoshiko who trembled seeing an ero-show, now completely sophisticated, her manner as a bar madam perfectly natural, with a sexiness not looking even 22 or 23,
"Dear, this is called 'Coca-Cola,' and since the Occupation forces came, it became famous all at once as the Occupation drink."
"Hahn, a tasty, stylish drink. If I let everyone drink it, they'd be happy. Alright, I like it. I'll make one too."
His forte was being quick to spot trends—buying a ramune factory from an acquaintance in Kawachi and instantly becoming president, he had them make it by swallowing whole the manufacturing method in *Reader's Digest*, and somehow something very similar was completed.
"What shall we name it?"
"Well, you made it, so think of it yourself."
Even told by Yoshiko, "Tohoh," my habit came out again.
"Coca-Cola! This is a good name, but for registration violation I'll be scolded 'Kora-kora!' (Hey, hey!)... Ah, that's it! Ah, 'Kora-kora.' Coracora. This is the one," and immediately putting a full-page ad in the newspaper:
"Soft Drink Coracora! Grand Promotional Sale."

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

**[Main Text: The Birth of "Coracora"]**
"Hah! Keeping my mistress doesn't cost me a cent. In fact, she makes money for me!" Genkichi bragged to everyone he met. Having left his "Sex Store" and marriage agency entirely in the hands of his staff, he was currently at a small bar behind the Sennichimae Kabuki theater, sipping drinks at a stand run by his young "Number Three."
"Hmm, this is a strange drink. What do you call it, Yoshiko?"
Yoshiko had once been Genkichi’s secretary—a quiet girl who used to tremble at the sight of a striptease. Now, she was unrecognizable: sophisticated, a natural bar madam, and radiating a sultry charm that defied her twenty-two or twenty-three years.
"Honey, this is what they call 'Coca-Cola.' It's the Occupation Army's drink that’s become famous overnight since the troops arrived."
"Hmph, it’s a tasty, classy little drink. I bet everyone would love it. Alright, I’m sold. I’ll whip some up myself."
Genkichi’s only real talent was his opportunism. He bought a ramune factory from a friend in Kawachi, installed himself as president, and ordered his staff to follow a recipe he’d blindly lifted from *Reader's Digest*. Miraculously, they produced something that tasted almost like the real thing.
"What should I call it?" he asked.
"Well, you're the one who made it," Yoshiko replied, "so you think of something."
Chastised even by her, Genkichi fell back into his old habits.
"Coca-Cola! It’s a great name, but the trademark people will yell 'Kora-kora!' (Hey, you!) at me for infringing... Wait, that’s it! 'Kora-kora.' Coracora! That’s the one!"
He immediately took out a full-page newspaper ad: "Refreshing Soft Drink Coracora! Grand Launch Special!"

**[Sub-article: Memories of Siberia]**
*A Record of Wandering as a POW in North Korea and Siberia*
By Takeshi Anabuki
*Toilets and Exhibitionism*
A man crouches, straining, as blood from a fistula gushes onto the skeletal, malnourished corpse before him. Right beside him stands a comrade, his face silently pleading, "Hurry up and let me have a turn." This was the typical morning scene at the Siberian internment camp.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** Vertical text (tategaki) in a multi-column format. The page is densely packed with text, typical of low-budget post-war magazines.
*   **Typography:** Uses a variety of font sizes. Headings are larger and bolder. The title "北鮮シベリヤ俘虜放浪記" is enclosed in a decorative dashed border to separate it from the fictional/scandalous narrative above.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The top story is the lead, intended to entertain with humor and mild eroticism (the "mimi-shinsetsu" or "kasutori" style). The bottom piece is a serialized memoir, common in these magazines to provide a balance of "stomach-churning" reality and "titillating" fiction.
*   **Illustrations:** No illustrations on this specific page, which is common for interior text pages of cheap magazines of the era.

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era:** Likely late 1940s (Occupation period). The mention of the "Occupation Forces" (進駐軍) and the novelty of Coca-Cola are dead giveaways.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** Named after a cheap, dregs-based shochu, these magazines were "three-drink" publications—meaning they rarely lasted more than three issues. They focused on "3S": Sport, Screen, and Sex (often interpreted as "Sensationalism").
*   **Siberian Internment:** After WWII, over 500,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians were taken to labor camps in the Soviet Union (Siberia and North Korea). Their memoirs, detailing extreme hunger and cold, were a staple of post-war literature.
*   **Coca-Cola and Reader's Digest:** These represent the sudden influx of American culture. Local entrepreneurs often tried to capitalize on these new, prestigious Western brands by making domestic imitations.
*   **Sennichimae (千日前):** A famous entertainment district in Osaka, known for its theaters and later, its gritty underground bars.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **妾囲い (Mekake-kakoi):** Keeping a mistress.
*   **三号 (Sangō):** Literally "Number Three." Slang for a third mistress/concubine.
*   **水商売 (Mizu-shōbai):** The "water trade"—nightlife industries like bars and clubs.
*   **シールズ軍 (Seals-gun?):** Likely a phonetic rendering or error for "US Forces" or a specific unit, though in this context, it refers to the Occupation Army.
*   **ラムネ (Ramune):** A traditional Japanese lemon-lime soda. The joke is that a Ramune factory is trying to pivot to making "Coke."
*   **コラコラ (Kora-kora):** A scolding sound like "Hey!" or "Now, now!" The pun is that "Coca-Cola" sounds like a scolding, so he renames it "Coracora."
*   **痔瘻 (Jirō):** Anal fistula, a common and painful ailment among malnourished POWs in Siberia due to extreme diarrhea and lack of hygiene.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Survival vs. Opportunism:** The Genkichi story highlights the chaotic, "anything goes" spirit of post-war reconstruction and the black market. Everything is a scam or a knock-off.
*   **Americanization:** The fascination with Coca-Cola and *Reader's Digest* shows the aspirational pull of American lifestyle during the Occupation, even while being satirized.
*   **The Contrast of Post-War Experience:** The page juxtaposes the ribaldry of the domestic black market (money, sex, fake soda) with the grim, death-filled memories of the soldiers who hadn't yet returned or had just come back from Siberia.
*   **Gallows Humor:** The naming of "Coracora" based on being scolded by authorities is a classic example of "Gesaku" (playful writing) subverting authority.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction (Satire/Pulp), Memoir (Historical/Naturalist).
*   **Primary Tags:** Post-war Japan, Kasutori Magazine, Coca-Cola, Siberian Internment, Black Market, Occupation Period.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Masculinity, Entrepreneurship, Survival, Trauma, Satire.
