## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

(Omitted) 1855, in England, further improved,
if trigger is pulled, first the cylinder rotates, new
bullets subsequently continuously can be fired became.
This mechanism's pistol is the oldest veteran. However,
presently the shape is very different,
and currently globally too much the gun type is large
and, to load the cartridges with a *gachitto* sound
it is inconvenient because of.

② Magazine Rifle (Dansōjū).
This type, into the fixed cartridge chamber,
five or six rounds are loaded with a *gachitto* sound.
The same procedure as loading the Type 38 Infantry Rifle.
If the trigger is pulled, the trigger is
returned, the casing is ejected, and furthermore new projectiles are
fed into the chamber, automatically loading.
The *blow-up* of these times is preferred.
In addition to the familiar Colt,
Wahlberg, Paul Charmant, Sugar,
Mang, Bell, Burkhart-Rübel,
Rössel—such elegantly named
Walther-Röser models are favored military
rifles. Pistols often seen in recent foreign
films.

④ Bewitching Princess of the Flat-Tip Color (Hira-china-iro no Yōki).
The pistol bullet is truly adorable. Even for a machine gun
or a rifle, the projectile head is pointed, length
approximately 1 sun 2 bu (3.6 cm), thickness approximately 1 bu 5 rin (0.45 cm), adding the casing
makes it about 5 sun (15 cm), when pressed it is *zushin* and heavy.
One thinks, "Yes, this can kill a person."
However, if it becomes a steel bullet, the length is approximately
4 sun (12 cm), thickness approximately 2 bu 5 rin (0.75 cm), adding the casing
it is merely that. The cool-skinned *prop*
seems like a children's fairy tale,
making one wonder if it is not a *dōmo* (common/ordinary thing).
Indeed, to be treated like that is good,
its shape and, like a modern woman, having both clean/pure parts
and also vulgar/charming parts. Especially when removing and cleaning the bullet,
the feeling deepens that the bewitching princess is a woman. (Furthermore,)
Rather than the large type that is pure/clean, put in a sack
and hung from the shoulder,
the small type that can be tucked into a pocket with a *kottsu* sound
looks even more bewitching. I also like it.
The structure of the gun and the weight of the bullet,
and in some places, the method of decomposing/disassembling the iron/copper parts,
if simple and not chintzy
like disassembling a watch, that way
is not strange, I think.

⑤ Toyotomi Hideyoshi (Hō Taikō) and the Pistol.
As mentioned before, the pistol
was invented approximately 450 years ago in the Italian
city of Brescia. But when did it come to Japan?
The oldest document stating that two pistols were
among the objects presented to the King of India in Tenshō 16 (Western Calendar
1588) by a Portuguese who drifted to the Ryukyu Islands
is the oldest record. The interesting aspect that Hideyoshi
fondly cherished and played with,
judging by the high-power styles of today,
is merely something that made a large sound with
only gunpowder.

After that, in Kaei 6 (Western Calendar 1853), when American Envoy Perry
came to port, the military governors of the Shogunate, such as Hosokawa,
etc.
The figure with a topknot exactly like a pistol (Chonmage)
tied up, wearing jacket,
and trousers with formal dignity,
appearing timidly,
must have been a good souvenir for Perry.
Around the time of the Meiji Restoration (Western Calendar 1860),
various types of pistols were imported from America and England.
Young revolutionaries like Katsura Kogorō, Takasugi Shinsaku,
and Sakamoto Ryōma must have preferred pistols over man-slaying swords.
In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, the boisterous young men of the Shinsengumi
commanded by Kondō Isami,
it was one of the deep memories that brought cheerfulness to their hearts.

⑥ Useless Long Object: Type 16 (Jūroku-nen-shiki).
The Japanese Army first started using pistols
for soldiers in the early Meiji Era.
The Smith & Wesson model (cylinder, break-open,
six-shot) was adopted and carried by infantry, artillery,
transport corps, and military police.
In Meiji 26 (Western Calendar 1894),
pistols were manufactured at the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal.
This was the pistol called the Type 12.
This became the pistol called the Type 6.
Since Meiji 33 (Western Calendar 1900), thinking this wouldn't do,
and intending not to lose to Europe and America,
research into new, automatic pistols began,
and soon the Nambu Type Automatic Pistol was produced.
That, subsequently improved, became the Japanese
Army's service pistol, and the one
affectionately used *in a manner of a first retiree*
called the Type 16,
was the service gun until unconditional surrender.
In September, Showa 29 (1954), at Jiujiang, during the weapon disarmament,
it was completely handed over to the Chinese Army,
and it was a deep memory that made hearts feel cheerful.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

(A continuous discussion about the evolution of firearms, picking up mid-article.)

...In 1855, the mechanism was further refined in England: pulling the trigger automatically rotates the cylinder, allowing new rounds to be fired continuously. This type of revolver is the oldest veteran. However, the current form is vastly different, as modern models tend to be oversized, making it cumbersome to load the cartridges snugly.

② The Magazine Rifle (Dansōjū).
This rifle features a fixed magazine into which five or six rounds are loaded with a click. The loading process is similar to that of the Type 38 Infantry Rifle. Pulling the trigger, releasing it, ejecting the spent casing, and feeding a fresh projectile into the chamber is all done automatically. People tend to favor the "blow-up" mechanism of this era. Besides the ubiquitous Colt, military rifles favored include elegantly named models like Wahlberg, Paul Charmant, Sugats, Mang, Bell, Burkhart-Rübel, and Walther-Röser. These are the types of pistols often seen in recent foreign films.

④ The Bewitching Princess of the Flat-Tip.
The pistol cartridge is truly adorable. Even for machine guns or rifles, the bullet head is pointed, measuring about 3.6 cm long and 4.5 mm thick; adding the casing makes the total length about 15 cm, and pressing it gives a satisfyingly heavy *zushin*. One immediately understands its lethal power. However, if we discuss a steel bullet, it is merely about 12 cm long and 7.5 mm thick, including the casing. Its cool, metallic surface makes it feel like a child’s toy—one wonders if it’s anything special at all. Yet, the appeal is precisely in being treated this way. Its shape, like a modern woman, possesses both purity and a hint of vulgarity. Especially when one removes and cleans the bullet, the feeling deepens that this "bewitching princess" is indeed female. Furthermore, the small type that can be neatly tucked into a pocket, rather than the large, "pure" type carried in a sling bag over the shoulder, seems much more bewitching. I myself prefer the smaller models. I believe that a simple, elegant structure and a straightforward method of disassembly for the copper and iron parts—rather than a finicky, chintzy design requiring the skills of a watchmaker—is much more sensible for a firearm.

⑤ Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the Pistol.
As previously mentioned, the pistol was invented approximately 450 years ago in the Italian city of Brescia. But when did it arrive in Japan? The oldest record is found among the objects presented to the King of India in 1588 (Tenshō 16) by a Portuguese sailor who was shipwrecked in the Ryukyus, which included two pistols. The interesting point is that the pistol, which Hideyoshi cherished and enjoyed, would be considered a mere noise-maker that used gunpowder for a loud report, judging by today’s high-caliber standards.

Later, in 1853 (Kaei 6), when the American envoy Commodore Perry arrived, the appearance of Shogunate officials, such as Hosokawa, the Military Governor, sporting topknots shaped exactly like pistols (*Chonmage*), and dressed impeccably in formal jackets and trousers, must have made a fine souvenir for Perry.

Around the time of the Meiji Restoration (circa 1860), various types of pistols were imported from America and Britain. Young revolutionaries like Katsura Kogorō, Takasugi Shinsaku, and Sakamoto Ryōma undoubtedly preferred the pistol to the traditional man-slaying sword. In the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, the pistol was a deep source of cheerful morale for the boisterous young men of the Shinsengumi, commanded by Kondō Isami.

⑥ The Useless Relic: The Type 16.
The Japanese Army first equipped its soldiers with pistols in the early Meiji Era. They adopted the Smith & Wesson model (six-shot, break-open cylinder) for use by the infantry, artillery, transport corps, and military police. In 1894 (Meiji 26), the Tokyo Artillery Arsenal began manufacturing pistols. This was originally called the Type 12, which then became the Type 6. Since 1900 (Meiji 33), realizing these models were inadequate and determined not to lag behind Europe and America, research into new automatic pistols began, eventually leading to the Nambu Automatic Pistol. This model, after subsequent improvements, became the standard service pistol for the Japanese Army. However, the Type 16—which was affectionately used in a manner suggestive of a first retiree—remained the standard service weapon until the unconditional surrender. It was one of the deeply cheerful memories when, in September 1954 (Showa 29), during the weapon disarmament at Jiujiang, we completely handed them over to the Chinese Army.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

The content is presented in a classic Japanese **vertical writing** (Tate-gaki) format, typical of pre-digital newspapers, magazines, or non-fiction books from the mid-20th century.

**Structure and Layout:**
1.  **Columns:** The text flows across multiple vertical columns (likely 3 columns wide in the full layout, though only a portion is shown) from right to left.
2.  **Section Headings:** The article is broken down into numbered sections, indicated by large, centered, or slightly offset numbers followed by a title in slightly larger font (e.g., **② 弾倉銃**, **④ 平チナ色の妖姫**, **⑤ 豊太閤と拳銃**, **⑥ 無用の長物十六年式**).
3.  **Furigana:** Small phonetic annotations (furigana) are used extensively, primarily for:
    *   Foreign technical terms or names (e.g., ワルツロオゼーザ, プロウアップ, ペリー).
    *   Rare or complex Japanese terms/names (e.g., 豊太閤 [ほうたいこう], 丁髷 [チョンマゲ], 九江 [きゅうこう]).
4.  **Formatting:** Dates, especially Western calendar dates, are frequently enclosed in parentheses (e.g., 西暦一八五五年). Japanese traditional dating (e.g., 天正十六年) is often paired with the corresponding Western date for clarity.
5.  **Punctuation:** Standard Japanese vertical punctuation is used (small circles for periods, small commas for breath/separation).
6.  **Visual Hierarchy:** The section titles serve as the primary visual hierarchy markers, separating distinct topics within the broader discussion of firearms.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

This text is a piece of historical popular non-fiction discussing the adoption and use of pistols and rifles in Japan, particularly focusing on the late Tokugawa Shogunate (Bakumatsu) through the Meiji, Taishō, and early Shōwa eras.

**Dating the Text:** The final paragraph explicitly mentions the "weapon disarmament at Jiujiang [九江] in September 1954 (Showa 29)." This provides a strong *terminus post quem* (T.P.Q.), indicating the essay was written or published sometime *after* 1954, likely in the late 1950s or 1960s, a period when Japan was looking back critically at its pre-war military failures and equipment.

**Historical References:**
1.  **Foreign Firearms:** Extensive mention of 19th-century European and American firearms technology (Colt, Smith & Wesson, Walther-Röser, British improvements of 1855) highlights Japan's rapid adoption of Western military technology following its forced opening.
2.  **Perry's Arrival (嘉永6年/1853):** Perry's arrival symbolized the end of Japan's isolation. The description of the Shogunate officials' formal attire and "pistol-like topknots" (丁髷, *chonmage*) suggests the cultural clash observed by Perry, emphasizing how antiquated Japan appeared.
3.  **Bakumatsu Figures:** Figures like Sakamoto Ryōma, Katsura Kogorō, and Takasugi Shinsaku—heroes of the Meiji Restoration—are noted for favoring modern pistols over traditional samurai swords, illustrating the shift in power and technology.
4.  **Japanese Military Pistols:**
    *   **Type 16 (十六年式):** Introduced early in the Meiji period (often confused with Type 26, though the text calls it Type 16/Type 6/Type 12 sequence), it represents Japan's early, often flawed, attempts at adopting/producing Western technology. The author's critical label "Useless Relic" (無用の長物) is a direct, post-war indictment of its outdated nature, especially against modern warfare standards.
    *   **Nambu Automatic Pistol:** The reference to the Nambu (often called the "Nambu Type Automatic Pistol" or "Grandpa Nambu") shows the eventual attempt to modernize, though the author emphasizes that the older, less reliable model (Type 16/26) was still in service until the very end.
5.  **Jiujiang Disarmament (1954):** This event refers to post-WWII or early Cold War activities related to Japanese personnel returning from or remaining in China. The author's recollection of "cheerfully" handing over the obsolete Type 16 to the Chinese Army reflects a sense of relief and finality regarding the burden of Imperial Japan's antiquated military hardware.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

| Term (Japanese) | Transcription | Modern Equivalent/Meaning | Context/Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **輪胴** | *rindō* | Cylinder (of a revolver) | Technical term describing the rotating part holding cartridges. |
| **ガチッと** | *gachitto* | Snugly, with a click/snap (Onomatopoeia) | Used to describe the secure loading of cartridges into the magazine/chamber. |
| **弾倉銃** | *dansōjū* | Magazine rifle (repeating rifle) | Refers to rifles loaded via a magazine, distinct from single-shot or manual loading. |
| **プロウアップ** | *purou appu* | Blow-up (mechanism) | A possible misreading or period-specific term for a gas-operated or blowback action, or perhaps simply referring to the "expansion" or design profile. |
| **洒落れた** | *shareta* | Elegant, stylish, sophisticated | Used to describe the names of European gun manufacturers (e.g., Walther-Röser). |
| **平チナ色の妖姫** | *hira-china iro no yōki* | Bewitching Princess of the Flat-Tip Color | Highly metaphorical description of a pistol bullet, personifying it as a desirable, sometimes vulgar, woman. *Hira-china* likely refers to a specific shape or metal finish (flat/copper-like). |
| **一寸二分** | *issun nibu* | Approx. 3.6 cm (traditional Japanese measurement) | Detailed measurement of the bullet, showing technical specificity blended with literary style. |
| **豊太閤** | *Hō Taikō* | Grand Chancellor Hideyoshi (Toyotomi Hideyoshi) | Formal, respectful title for the historical figure Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537–1598). |
| **丁髷** | *chonmage* | Topknot (traditional hairstyle) | Specifically referenced during Perry’s visit, noting its odd, pistol-like shape when viewed by Westerners (an unusual observation). |
| **復員風の御愛用** | *fukuin-fū no go-aiyō* | Affectionately used in the manner of a first retiree (or demobilized soldier) | Suggests the Type 16 was so old and outdated that it was treated with a gentle, perhaps patronizing, affection, like an old veteran who had fulfilled his service. |
| **無用の長物** | *muyō no chōbutsu* | Useless long object/Relic | A classic idiom/proverb meaning something that is useless despite its size or history. Used here as a critical nickname for the obsolete Type 16 pistol. |

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

**1. The Romanticism of Technology:** The author uses highly romanticized, anthropomorphic language to describe inert objects. The bullet is a "Bewitching Princess" (妖姫), possessing both "purity" and "vulgarity." This technique makes the technical discussion relatable and engaging, treating the firearms not just as tools of war, but as objects of fascination, beauty, and even sexual attraction (linking the gun's dissection to the deeper feeling that the "princess is female").

**2. The Inevitability of Modernization:** A central theme is Japan's shift from feudal reliance on traditional weapons (swords) to modern, industrialized arms. The Bakumatsu figures are portrayed as embracing modernity by choosing pistols over swords. The critique of the Type 16 highlights the failure of the Japanese military establishment to keep pace with Western technological advancements, leading to the designation of its old service weapon as a "Useless Relic."

**3. Nostalgia and Post-War Critique:** The essay blends technical history with personal anecdote and national memory. The final section, describing the "cheerfulness" felt when handing over the obsolete Type 16 to the Chinese Army in 1954, carries significant subtext. It implies a sense of relief—the burden of fighting a modern war with outdated tools, a symbol of Imperial Japan's hubris and eventual failure, was finally shed. The "deep memories" are complex, encompassing both the trauma of war and the lightness of letting go of its symbols.

**4. Blending Popular History and Technical Detail:** The text is structured to appeal to a general audience interested in both military history and cultural context. It meticulously details measurements and mechanical specifics (e.g., bullet size, cylinder rotation) while weaving in figures like Hideyoshi and Sakamoto Ryōma, making the technical history part of a larger national narrative.
