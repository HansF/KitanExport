「いけません！ 小父さん！ 駄目よ」

「奥様、今日は満願の日だてねえか。子種は天神様の御許して俺がのを継ぜるだて静かにしべえ。」

夢から醒めたような気持に帰った。自身の肉体が、熊爺の厚い胸へ抱かれているのだと知ると、飛びのこうとしたが動けなかつた。いつのまにか、脇の下に廻されていた爺の、例の”熊の掌”が衣物の八ツ口から入り込んで、彼女の、マヤ夫人の乳房をギッシリつかんでいる。
「いけません！ 小父さん！ 駄目よ！」
ヒサ子は必死に争つた。
「奥様。今日は満願の日だでねえか。子種は天神様の御許して、俺がのを継ぜるだで、静かにしべえ。」
彼女は足をバタ／＼して、襖のように悲鳴をあげた。途に、その悲鳴を待ち兼ねていたのでもあるかのように、鶴青開きがサアッと開かれると、懐中電燈を持つた一人の男が飛び込んで来た。
その大型灯の光の輪を受けて、熊爺は呆然とした。瞬間にヒサ子は跳ね起きた。夫だつた。信夫氏だつた。
「出て行け！ けもの！」
信夫は爺へ吐き出すように云った。
「なにぃ？ けもの？」

熊爺は、信夫の方へ凄んでみせたが、暗くてわからないので、懐中電燈の薄明るい光線の中に、ヒサ子の露き出しにされた二の腕や乳房を、みれんたらしくヂロ〜く眺めていた。
「出ていかんのか？ おとなしく出て行けば、駐在へ届けるのだけは、ガマンしてやる。」
「へえんだ。俺がけものなら旦那もけものだべ。」
爺は惜しげに葉ぜりふを残すと、強く扉を蹴って出て行った。
爺が去ると、ヒサ子は乱れた姿の儘、信夫氏に咬みつくようにしていた。
「あなた！すみません！ 悪かつたわ！ あたし……」
彼女はこのまま夫に抱きついて泣きじゃくりたかつた。
「……世の中が悪いんだわ。いゝ年をして、恥づかしい……」
「ヒサ子。ちよっとお放し。まだ奴さん、うろ／＼しとるらしいから……」
信夫は彼女の手を引いて、内殿を出ると、彼の照らし出す懐中電燈の光芒の中に、バタ／＼と石段を駆け下りて行く老爺の醜い姿が映つた。
「呆れた奴だ。俺は街道筋の住居を早急に取極める爲、源太郎さんの家で、少し手間をとったのだ。夕飯を出されてムゲに断り憎く、御馳走になつたりしたものだから、余計に遅くなつたのだよ。待つておると信じたお前がいないし、あれも大げさだが、ともかくあれを見ると、懐中電燈一本を持つて飛んできたんだ。ヒサ子。子授け神様の正体がわかつたろう。」
ヒサ子は一言も無かつた。只、夫の長身の躰に凭れるようにしていた。
「とんだ岩見重太郎の狒々退治さ。昭和の御時世にも、こんなお茶番があるんだからなア……。世の中ア面白いよ。」
信夫氏は、カラ／＼と笑つてみせた。ヒサ子は今夜ほど夫をたのもしく力強く思つた事は、かつて無かつた。彼女は秘そかに、信夫氏の腕に、自分の腕をやわらかくからませていつた。

「いけません！ おじさん！ だめよ」

「奥様、今日は満願の日ではないですか。子種は天神様の許しを得て、俺のものを継がせるのだから、静かにしましょう。」

夢から覚めたような気持ちに返った。自身の肉体が、熊爺（くまじい）の厚い胸へ抱かれているのだと知ると、飛びのこうとしたが動けなかった。いつの間にか、脇の下に回されていた爺の、例の”熊の掌”が衣類の八つ口（やつぐち）から入り込んで、彼女の、マヤ夫人の乳房をぎっしり掴んでいる。

「奥様。今日は満願の日ではないですか。子種は天神様の許しを得て、俺のものを継がせるのだから、静かにしましょう。」
彼女は足をバタバタさせて、鵺（ぬえ）のように悲鳴をあげた。ついに、その悲鳴を待ちかねていたのでもあるかのように、唐紙（からかみ）がサアッと開かれると、懐中電灯を持った一人の男が飛び込んできた。
その大型灯の光の輪を受けて、熊爺は呆然とした。瞬間にヒサ子は跳ね起きた。夫だった。信夫（しのぶ）氏だった。
「出て行け！ 獣（けもの）！」
信夫は爺へ吐き出すように言った。
「なにぃ？ 獣？」

熊爺は、信夫の方へ凄んでみせたが、暗くてわからないので、懐中電灯の薄明るい光線の中に、ヒサ子の剥き出しにされた二の腕や乳房を、未練たらしくじろじろと眺めていた。
「出ていかないのか？ おとなしく出て行けば、駐在へ届けるのだけは、我慢してやる。」
「ふん。俺が獣なら旦那も獣だべ。」
爺は捨て台詞（すてぜりふ）を残すと、強く扉を蹴って出て行った。
爺が去ると、ヒサ子は乱れた姿のまま、信夫氏に噛みつくようにしていた。
「あなた！ すみません！ 悪かったわ！ あたし……」
彼女はこのまま夫に抱きついて泣きじゃくりたかった。
「……世の中が悪いんだわ。いい年をして、恥ずかしい……」
「ヒサ子。ちょっとお放し。まだ奴さん、うろちょろしているらしいから……」

ヒサ子は一言もなかった。ただ、夫の長身の体に寄りかかるようにしていた。
「とんだ岩見重太郎の狒々（ひひ）退治さ。昭和の御時世にも、こんな茶番があるんだからなあ……。世の中は面白いよ。」
信夫氏は、からからと笑ってみせた。ヒサ子は今夜ほど夫を頼もしく力強く思ったことは、かつてなかった。彼女は密かに、信夫氏の腕に、自分の腕を柔らかく絡ませていった。

"It must not be! Uncle! No good!"
Hisako desperately struggled.
"Madam. Today fulfillment day is, is it not? Child-seed Tenjin-sama's permission with, mine will succeed, so quietly let's do."
She legs flapped, like a Nue (mythical beast) scream raised. Finally, that scream waiting-was-tired-of as if, sliding door swiftly was opened, flashlight holding one man jumped in.
That large lamp's light circle receiving, Kuma-old-man was dazed. In an instant Hisako jumped up. It was husband. Shinobu-shi it was.

"You mustn't! Uncle, stop! No!"

"Madam, isn't today the day your prayers are answered? With the Great Tenjin's blessing, I'm here to pass on my seed. Now, let’s be quiet about it."

She came to her senses as if waking from a dream. The moment she realized her body was pressed against the hairy, barrel chest of Old Man Kuma, she tried to bolt, but she was pinned. Before she knew it, the old man’s infamous "bear paws" had slipped through the side-slits of her kimono, his rough hands squeezing her breasts—the breasts of the refined Madam Maya.
"No! Uncle! Stop!" 
Hisako fought him with everything she had.
"Madam, today is the day of fulfillment. Tenjin-sama has ordained that I provide the seed. Just stay still and be quiet."
She kicked her legs wildly and let out a shriek like a dying beast. As if he had been waiting for that very cry, the sliding door was flung open, and a man wielding a flashlight burst into the room.
Bathed in the circular glow of the powerful beam, Old Man Kuma froze. Hisako scrambled to her feet instantly. It was her husband, Shinobu.
"Get out of here, you animal!" Shinobu spat the words at the old man.
"Whad’ya say? An animal, am I?"

The old man tried to look menacing, but in the darkness, he couldn't see much. He simply stood there, his eyes greedily fixed on Hisako’s exposed arms and breasts where they were illuminated by the flashlight's pale beam.
"Are you leaving or not? If you go quietly, I might refrain from calling the police."
"Hmph. If I’m an animal, then the Master here is an animal too," the old man grumbled. With a final, bitter parting shot, he kicked the door and stomped out.
As soon as he was gone, Hisako, her clothes in disarray, threw herself at Shinobu in a frantic state.
"Oh, darling! I'm so sorry! It was my fault! I..."
She wanted to collapse into his arms and sob. 
"It's the world's fault... I'm so old, and yet this is so shameful..."
"Hisako, let go for a second. I think that creep is still loitering nearby."
Shinobu took her hand and led her out of the inner sanctuary. In the beam of his flashlight, they saw the grotesque figure of the old man scurrying down the stone steps.
"What a piece of work," Shinobu sighed. "I was delayed at Gentaro’s house trying to finalize our new place by the highway. They served dinner and it was hard to refuse their hospitality, which is why I was so late. When I found you weren't where you were supposed to be, I heard the commotion. It sounded a bit exaggerated, but I came running with just this flashlight. Well, Hisako, I think you finally see the 'Child-Granting God' for what he really is."
Hisako said nothing. She simply leaned against her husband’s tall frame.
"It’s like a scene out of a legend—Iwami Jutaro slaying the baboon. To think such a ridiculous farce still happens in this modern Showa era... the world truly is a strange place."
Shinobu let out a hearty laugh. Hisako had never felt her husband was as reliable or as strong as she did that night. Secretly, she twined her arm softly around his.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format and Layout:** This is a single-page spread from a magazine. The text is arranged in vertical columns (tategaki), read from top to bottom and right to left. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The page features a large, stylized illustration at the top, which serves as a hook for the reader. The main headline/pull-quote is written in a larger, hand-drawn, more expressive font compared to the body text.
*   **Typography:** The body text uses a standard Mincho-style typeface common in mid-century Japanese printing. Small kana (furigana) are used sparingly for difficult kanji. Punctuation includes standard periods, commas, and quotation marks, as well as repetition marks (like the "slash" iteration mark for "bata-bata").
*   **Illustration:** The art style is evocative of the "Kasutori" genre—rough, somewhat erotic, and dramatic. It depicts a "shunga-lite" scene: a bearded, rustic man (the "villain") embracing a woman whose kimono is falling open, while a modern-looking man with a flashlight intervenes. This visual summarizes the conflict between rural superstition/lust and urban modernity/reason.
*   **Design Features:** There is a decorative border at the top. The page number (seven) is visible in the middle right. A small floral or leaf-like icon is at the bottom center.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Publication Era:** The text mentions "Showa" and uses vocabulary/themes typical of the immediate post-WWII period (1945–1955). This was the era of "Kasutori" magazines—cheaply made, sensationalist publications that focused on "3S" (Sex, Screen, Sports).
*   **Mangan (満願):** This refers to the fulfillment of a religious vow. In folk belief, women struggling with infertility would pray at shrines.
*   **Child-Granting God (子授け神様):** A common trope in Japanese folklore and erotica where a "god" (often a disguised local man or priest) would "provide the seed" to a woman seeking a child. This text subverts the trope by revealing it as a "farce" (chaban) and an attempted assault.
*   **Iwami Jutaro (岩見重太郎):** A legendary warrior famous for slaying a giant baboon (hihi) that demanded human sacrifices. The husband uses this as a metaphor for "slaying" the "beastly" old man.
*   **Social Convention:** The mention of "Maya-fujin" (Madam Maya) suggests the woman is of a certain social standing, making the "shame" of the rural superstition more acute. The husband's modern rationality (flashlight, choosing a house by the highway) contrasts with the "inner sanctuary" (naiden) of the shrine and the old man's dialect.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **Kuma-jii (熊爺):** Literally "Old Man Bear." A nickname implying a hairy, hulking, or beast-like appearance.
*   **Hatsuguchi (八ツ口):** An opening in the side of a kimono under the armpit, originally for ventilation but often used in erotic literature as a point of entry for wandering hands.
*   **Kotane (子種):** "Child-seed," a euphemism for sperm.
*   **Bata-bata (バタ／＼):** Onomatopoeia for flailing legs or running feet.
*   **Baba-zerifu (葉ぜりふ / 捨て台詞):** A parting shot or a defiant remark made while leaving.
*   **Chaban (お茶番):** A farce or a rigged/ridiculous performance.
*   **~da-te / ~be (だて / べ):** Rural Japanese dialects (likely Tohoku or northern Kanto), used here to characterize the old man as unrefined and uneducated compared to the husband.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Modernity vs. Tradition:** The story sets up a conflict between "backwards" rural superstitions (the child-granting god) and modern Showa-era rationality (the husband with his flashlight and practical concerns).
*   **The "Beast" vs. The "Man":** The old man is explicitly called a "beast" (kemono), and the husband is compared to a legendary hero. The subtext is that unbridled lust is primitive/bestial, whereas modern marriage is protective and "reliable."
*   **Vulnerability and Shame:** The female protagonist (Hisako/Maya) is caught between her desire for a child/religious belief and the reality of sexual assault. Her sense of "shame" (hazukashii) reflects the social pressures on women of the era.
*   **Rescue Romance:** The narrative follows a classic melodrama arc: peril, timely intervention, and a romantic resolution that reinforces the husband's status as the provider and protector.
