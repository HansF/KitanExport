南海の奇譚 (105)

その部落には奇習があり、娘を嫁にやる前には、必ず股座にゐる「肉の蝶」を、村の長老が確認する儀式があつた。
これは貞節を保つ為と、子宝に恵まれるかを占ふためと云ふ。だが真の目的は、女の隠された局部（そこ）を衆目に晒す悦楽に他ならなかつた。
少女（をとめ）は皆、恐怖と羞恥に震へながら、その儀式を耐へ忍んだ。嗚呼、この島では、性の呪縛は深く、逃れる術は誰も知らぬのであつた。

## Literal English Translation

A Tale of the South Seas (105)

In that village there was a peculiar custom, and before sending a daughter off as a bride, there was always a ceremony in which the village elder confirmed the "flesh butterfly" residing between her thighs.
They say this was for maintaining chastity and for divining whether she would be blessed with children. However, the true purpose was nothing other than the pleasure of exposing the woman's hidden genitalia (that place) to public view.
The maidens, all of them, endured that ritual while trembling with fear and shame. Ah, on this island, the spell of sexuality was deep, and no one knew the means of escape.

## Literary English Translation

A Bizarre Tale from the South Seas (105)

That village harbored a peculiar rite: before any daughter could be sent off as a bride, a mandatory ceremony took place where the village elder would inspect the "flesh butterfly" dwelling between her thighs.
Ostensibly, this procedure guaranteed her chastity and served to divine her fertility. Yet, the genuine objective was none other than the gratification derived from exposing the woman’s secret parts to the public gaze.
All the young maidens endured the ritual, shaking with terror and deep humiliation. Ah, on this island, the curse of carnal desire ran deep, and none knew how to break free.

## Editorial & Structural Analysis

| Feature | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Likely Section Type** | Pseudo-Ethnographic Reportage or Sensational Fiction. This style (detailing remote "primitive" customs) was common in *Kitan Club* to provide erotic content under the guise of anthropological study. |
| **Author Attribution** | Anonymous or attributed to a vague "observer/researcher." The voice is third-person and highly dramatic. |
| **Editorial Voice** | The tone is one of detached, yet moralizing, fascination. It uses archaic language (Historical Kana Usage) to lend an air of seriousness or antiquity to the subject matter. |
| **Target Audience Signals** | Uses euphemisms ("flesh butterfly," "that place") designed to titillate a predominantly urban male readership interested in exoticized, non-consensual sexual transgression and female shame. |
| **Positioning** | A short, high-impact piece, possibly part of a recurring column titled *Kitan* (Bizarre Tales) or *Fuzoku Kitan* (Bizarre Sexual Customs). The page number (105) suggests it is deep within the magazine, often where the most explicit content was placed. |

## Cultural & Historical Notes

| Term / Concept | Contextual Annotation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **南海の奇譚** (Nankai no Kitan) | Refers to the South Seas (Pacific islands, often associated with former Japanese colonial territories or remote areas). In post-war Japanese pulp, the South Seas symbolized exotic, untamed, and "primitive" sexuality, contrasting sharply with the rapidly modernizing and sexually repressed urban centers. |
| **奇習** (Kishū) | 'Peculiar custom.' This term functions as a literary device to legitimize the description of taboo sexual acts by framing them as socio-cultural practices, thereby bypassing censorship requirements for outright pornography. |
| **貞節** (Teisetsu) | Chastity/fidelity. A highly prized attribute for women in Showa-era society. The text highlights how patriarchal authority (the elder) polices this value via forced inspection, demonstrating control over female bodies and reproduction. |
| **衆目に晒す悦楽** | The pleasure of public exposure. This taps directly into the core *Ero-Guro* interest in voyeurism, exhibitionism, and the ritualized humiliation of the female subject, often depicted as a form of social control masking personal sadism. |
| **歴史的仮名遣ひ** | The consistent use of old kana (ゐ, あつた, 震へ) is a stylistic choice common in mid-century intellectual or high-pulp magazines to evoke classical literature, seriousness, or academic depth, even when discussing vulgar subjects. |

## Lexical Notes & Euphemisms

| Term | Meaning / Usage in Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| **股座** (Matagura) | Crotch/groin area. A relatively explicit anatomical term. |
| **「肉の蝶」** (Niku no Chō) | **Euphemism.** Literally "Flesh butterfly." A highly poetic and suggestive term for the vulva, emphasizing its delicate, folded shape. This euphemism softens the description while enhancing the erotic focus. |
| **局部（そこ）** (Kyokubu, Soko) | **Euphemism.** *Kyokubu* means "private parts/genitalia." The ruby reading **そこ** (*Soko*, "that place") acts as a deictic euphemism, signaling that the place is too taboo to name directly, increasing the sensational effect. |
| **占ふ** (Uranau) | To divine or predict fate. Here, predicting fertility (子宝). |
| **性の呪縛** (Sei no Jubaku) | The "spell/curse of sexuality." Used dramatically to frame the custom not just as a social rule, but as an inescapable, primal force of nature or fate, justifying the tragic tone. |

## Themes & Subtext

*   **Patriarchal Control:** The village elder's absolute authority over the bodies and destinies of young women is the central mechanism of the "custom."
*   **Ritualized Humiliation:** The ceremony transforms a private, taboo act (viewing genitalia) into a public, institutionalized event, maximizing the shame and terror (恐怖と羞恥) experienced by the victims, which is the primary source of erotic gratification for the observers and, by extension, the reader.
*   **Voyeurism and Exoticism:** The text positions the reader as an enlightened observer peering into a "primitive" society where sexual taboos are brutally and publicly violated. The exotic South Seas setting provides the necessary distance to consume this violation safely.
*   **Ero-Guro Sadism:** The pleasure (悦楽) is explicitly derived from the non-consensual exposure (晒す) of the girl's hidden parts, aligning the text firmly with the sadomasochistic tendencies common in the ero-guro genre, specifically regarding institutionalized power abuse.
