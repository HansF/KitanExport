「しまった、や、や、やられた！」
彼はあわてゝ懐を見廻すと、
やにわに花子の腕をぐつと掴んだ。
「こらつ、恐ろしい事をする奴だ、
いゝやお前だ、確かにお前だ、さあ
出せ、出さぬか、出さねえと……」

「知りません、妾、何んにも知りま

花子はつばを向いて答える。
「よし、どうしても知らんといふな

か、それとも裸が嫌なら今のうちに返す
か」
彼はにやりと好色な笑いを浮べた
「そ、そんな無茶なことを……」
花子は恨めしそうに、彼を睨んで
唇をぎりりと噛んだ。
「さあ、どうするんだ、スグ此の場

「さあ一万円の札束をここへ出せ。もう駄目だよ、諦めてさっさと出しな」
彼の大きな声に、そこへ忽ち黒山の人だかりができてしまった。
「失礼にも程があるわよ、は、離してください、何を、何を証拠にそんな……」
花子は恥と怒りに真っ赤になって叫ぶ。

――へん、誰が畜生、それじゃあ一つ私の切り札を見せてやろうか、驚くな助平め――
花子は急にガラリと調子を変えた。
「いいわよ、裸になってやろうじゃないか、でもねえ、それでもあんたの金が出なかったら……一体どうしてくれるのさ、大勢の前で裸にされて私、そのまま黙っちゃあ帰れないわよ、いいかい、そこの助平さん」

"Oh no, oh, oh, I was done in!"
He hurriedly looked around his bosom, and suddenly Hanako’s arm firmly grabbed.
"Hey you, a person who does fearful things you are, no it is you, certainly it is you, come on, put it out, won't you put it out, if you don't put it out..."
—Oh no— while thinking, Hanako was not losing.
"Wha, what is it, how rude, I what have stolen do you say?"
Arriving at the next stop, the black marketeer Hanako by force dragged down.
"Now, the ten thousand yen wad of bills here put out. It’s no use anymore, give up and quickly put it out."
At his big voice, there immediately a black mountain of a crowd formed.
"There is a limit even to rudeness, le- let go please, what, what evidence as for such..."
Hanako with shame and anger becoming bright red, shouts.
"Humph, don't make a fool [of me], a stubborn woman you are, if this is not your doing, whose doing is it, hey."
Being slashed by a sharp blade jacket, he exaggeratedly beats and shows.
"I don't know, I, anything at all do not know."
Hanako, facing away, answers.
"Alright, if you say you absolutely don't know, there's no choice, shall I have you become naked, or if nakedness is disliked, while it's now, will you return it?"
He with a smirk a lecherous smile floated.
"Su- such an unreasonable thing..."
Hanako as if resentful, glaring at him, her lips tightly bit.
"Now, what will you do, right now in this place will you become naked, or, the stolen thing will you return..."
—Hmph, who [will return it] beast, in that case for once my trump card I will show you, don't be surprised you lecher—
Hanako suddenly completely her tone changed.
"Fine, I'll become naked, won't I, but you see, even so if your money does not come out... exactly what will you do for me, being made naked in front of a crowd and I— just like that silently cannot go home, you see, you lecher there."
Hanako, suddenly her sash began to untie. The surrounding curious onlookers, as if an unexpected spectacle "Waah!" a cheer they raised. —
Hanako's flashy kimono immediately to her feet slid down. As if burning, the charming long undergarment also—and the pure white underwear also—Hanako without regret, there threw away.
On the subway platform, an unseasonable flower of flesh bloomed.
On Hanako's white smooth bare skin, plumply swelling up two breasts, like fresh fruit, the men's senses irresistibly stirred. The black marketeer also, the surrounding people also, at beautiful Hanako's naked body as if sucked in, were entranced.
"Now, is your satisfaction reached, how is it, Mr. Lecher?"
"…………"
The black marketeer in silence remained, at the destination of the non-appearing wad of bills, an expression as if about to cry.
Hanako quickly near him approaching, to that cheek suddenly "smack" a palm strike gave.
"Ho- somehow it's strange, such a thing shouldn't be... no, I, I was wrong..."
With a bow of the head he suddenly into the crowd fled away.
"Wait, hey you beast, making a person naked and 'I was wrong' with being finished, can I stand for that?"
At his retreating figure she shouted, but as expected naked she couldn't chase, and quickly clothes began to put on.
—Phew, an exorcism [good riddance], it made me labor. By now Shin-chan that wad of bills holding should be waiting, quickly let's go home—
There, a thirty-five or six-year-old suit-wearing gentleman sluggishly approaching, Hanako's shoulder lightly tapped.
"Hey, Hanako, did something happen?"
At that voice, sharply turning around Hanako, instantly, with a beaming smile making,
"Oh, who I thought it was... Mr. Kurogane, oh how embarrassing, were you watching?"
—Hmph, pathetic detective, by you to be caught, such a fool I am not— so inside her mouth, on the surface as if acting spoiled, Hanako the kimono's front drew together.

(2)

A certain—neither clearing nor clouding, softly growing dark, a distressing spring evening.
OO Steamship Company executive, Mr. Yokoyama, his plumply fattened body unusually on foot, reached a certain street corner.
"No, I just happened to come by but... exactly what happened, a scene like a young girl in such a place putting on clothes, isn't it a bit strange?"
As if embarrassed scratching his head, Kurogane, Detective Tetsurokuhei, from wherever you look such a person he doesn't seem, with an innocent face is laughing.
"No, that's... because of a trivial false accusation, I am in a hurry, so with this [goodbye]."
"Hoho..." with a laugh left behind,
Hanako into the crowd disappeared. Leaving Tetsurokuhei behind.
Shortly after that, under the cherry blossoms of XX Park, the figures of Hanako and Shinkichi were seen.
"Phew~~ earlier, a terrible blunder I stepped into."
"Even so, in that place becoming naked to show, what great courage Hanako-chan has."
"Hoho... were you watching, Shin-chan? That kind of thing is nothing."
Hanako to her underling Shinkichi the wad of bills dividing. With a "hmph" snorting her nose she brags,
"The world is surprisingly easy."

"Damn it! I’ve been hit!"
The man frantically checked his coat pocket, then suddenly lunged forward and grabbed Hanako’s arm in a vice grip.
"You! You've got some nerve! No, it was definitely you. I know it. Now cough it up! Give it back, or else..."
*I'm in a spot,* Hanako thought, but she wasn't about to back down.
"Wh-what are you doing? How rude! What exactly are you accusing me of stealing?"
When the bus reached the next stop, the black marketeer dragged Hanako off by force.
"Hand over that ten-thousand-yen roll right now. It's over. Give it up and hand it over!"
His booming voice instantly drew a massive crowd of curious onlookers.
"You're crossing the line! L-let go of me! What proof do you have? On what grounds are you..."
Hanako shouted, her face flushing crimson with a mixture of shame and fury.
"Hah! Don't play dumb with me, you stubborn brat. If it wasn't you, then who was it? Look at this!"
He dramatically slapped his jacket, which had been sliced open by a razor-sharp blade.
"I don't know anything about that! I didn't do anything!"
Hanako spat the words back at him, averting her eyes.
"Fine. If you're going to play it that way, I've got no choice. Either you strip right here and now, or if you don't want to be naked, you return the money while you still can."
A lecherous smirk crept across his face.
"Y-you can't be serious..."
Hanako glared at him with resentment, biting her lip hard.
"Well? What's it going to be? Do you strip right here, or do you give back what you stole?"
*Hmph. Who are you calling a beast? Fine, then. I guess I'll show you my trump card. Don't be surprised, you old lech.*
Hanako’s tone suddenly shifted completely.
"Fine then. I'll strip for you. But listen—if your money isn't on me... what are you going to do about it? You can't expect me to just walk away after being made to strip in front of all these people. Are we clear, Mr. Pervert?"
Without warning, Hanako began to untie her sash. The crowd of gawkers let out a collective cheer at the unexpected show.
Hanako’s flashy kimono slid to her feet in an instant. Her fiery, glamorous silk undergarment followed—and then her pure white underclothes—Hanako cast them all aside without a hint of hesitation.
Right there on the subway platform, an unseasonable flower of flesh bloomed.
The sight of Hanako's smooth, white skin and her two full, rounded breasts—like fresh fruit—stirred the men's lust to the breaking point. Both the black marketeer and the crowd stood entranced, eyes glued to Hanako’s naked form.
"Well? Are you satisfied now, Mr. Pervert?"
"……"
The black marketeer stood speechless, a look of utter despair on his face as he realized his money was nowhere to be found.
Hanako stepped up to him and, with a sharp *crack*, delivered a stinging slap to his cheek.
"I-I don't understand. It shouldn't be... No, I... I was wrong..."
Bowing his head, he suddenly bolted, disappearing into the crowd.
"Wait! You bastard! You think you can just say 'I was wrong' after making me strip? Get back here!"
She screamed at his retreating back, but knowing she couldn't give chase while naked, she quickly began pulling her clothes back on.
*Phew. Good riddance. That was a lot of work. Shin-chan should be waiting for me with the money by now. I'd better head back.*
Just then, a gentleman in his mid-thirties approached casually and tapped Hanako on the shoulder.
"Hey, Hanako. Something happen?"
Hanako spun around, her expression hardening for a second before she forced a bright smile.
"Oh! I was wondering who it was... if it isn't Mr. Kurogane! Oh, how embarrassing... were you watching?"
*Hmph. You pathetic detective. I'm not such a fool as to get caught by the likes of you,* she thought, even as she pulled her kimono closed with an air of practiced innocence.

**(II)**

It was a restless spring evening, neither clear nor cloudy, as the light softly faded.
Mr. Yokoyama, an executive at the OO Steamship Company, was walking—an unusual choice for him—when he reached a certain street corner.
"Well, I just happened upon this scene... but what on earth is going on? Seeing a young girl putting on her clothes in a place like this is a bit peculiar, isn't it?"
Scratching his head sheepishly, Kurogane—Detective Tetsurokuhei, who looked nothing like a detective regardless of the angle—laughed with an innocent expression.
"Oh, it's nothing... just a trivial misunderstanding. I'm in a bit of a rush, so if you'll excuse me."
With a "ho-ho" laugh, Hanako slipped away into the crowd, leaving Tetsurokuhei behind.
Shortly thereafter, beneath the cherry blossoms in XX Park, Hanako and Shinkichi met.
"Whew! I really stepped in it earlier."
"Even so, stripping naked right there on the spot... you've got guts, Hanako-chan."
"Ho-ho... you saw that, Shin-chan? That kind of thing is nothing to me."
Hanako said as she began divvying up the wad of cash with her underling, Shinkichi. She let out a defiant snort.
"The world is a lot easier than people think."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Format & Layout:** The text is presented in a vertical orientation (tategaki), typical of Japanese literature. It is divided into columns.
*   **Typography:** The font is a Mincho-style serif, standard for mid-century printing. It includes small furigana-like markings for emphasis or specific readings, though less frequent here than in modern manga.
*   **Structure:** The story is serialized, indicated by the section marker "(二)" (Part 2) and the page number "(10)" at the bottom.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The dialogue is indented or set off by brackets 「 」, and internal monologues are set off by dashes ― ―.
*   **Punctuation:** It uses traditional Japanese punctuation: commas (、), periods (。), and iteration marks (ゝ, ヽ) which are now largely obsolete but common in pre-modern and early modern texts.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Postwar Era (Late 1940s):** The mention of "Yami-ya" (black marketeers) and the chaotic social atmosphere suggests the immediate postwar period (1945–1950). In this era, the black market was essential for survival as the official rationing system failed.
*   **Kasutori Culture:** This term refers to the cheap, low-quality alcohol of the era and the "Kasutori magazines" that accompanied it. These magazines featured stories of crime, sex, and scandals—hedonistic escapism for a population recovering from the trauma of war.
*   **10,000 Yen (一萬圓):** In the late 1940s, 10,000 yen was an astronomical sum, equivalent to many months' salary for a laborer, reflecting the hyperinflation and the high stakes of black market dealings.
*   **The "Pan-pan" and Bad Girls:** Hanako represents the "bad girl" archetype of the era—independent, criminal, and unafraid to use her sexuality to outmaneuver men. This was a popular trope in pulp fiction of the time.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **ヤミ屋 (Yami-ya):** Black market dealer.
*   **妾 (Watashi/Warawa):** An archaic or stylized first-person feminine pronoun, often used in fiction to denote a certain "type" of woman (bold, flirtatious, or traditional).
*   **助平 (Sukebe):** A lecher or pervert. A common insult then and now.
*   **弥次馬 (Yajiuma):** Curious onlookers or gawkers.
*   **長襦袢 (Nagajuban):** A long undergarment worn beneath a kimono. To show it in public was scandalous.
*   **濡衣 (Nureginu):** Literally "wet clothes," but idiomatically means a "false accusation."
*   **札びら (Satsubira):** A wad of bills, often used in the context of flashing money.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Survival and Deception:** The story highlights the "dog-eat-dog" nature of postwar Tokyo. Hanako is a pickpocket who uses a "shatei" (underling) to move the stolen goods while she creates a distraction.
*   **Sexuality as Power:** Hanako turns the threat of sexual humiliation (being stripped) into a weapon. By stripping voluntarily and brazenly, she seizes control of the situation, shames the accuser, and shocks the detective into inaction.
*   **The Bumbling Authority:** The "detective" Kurogane is portrayed as easily fooled and somewhat incompetent, a common theme in anti-authoritarian pulp fiction of the period.
*   **Nihilism:** The final line "The world is surprisingly easy" (or "sweet") reflects the cynical, opportunistic worldview prevalent in the *Kasutori* era.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Pulp Fiction, Short Story.
*   **Tags:** Postwar Japan, Black Market (Yami-ichi), Eroticism (Abunai), Crime, Pickpocket, Femmes Fatales, Kasutori Culture, 1940s.
