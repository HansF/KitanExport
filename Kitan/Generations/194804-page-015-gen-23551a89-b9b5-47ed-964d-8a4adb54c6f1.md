## 1️⃣ Original Japanese

やと拍手したり、いやに臆病なくせに、ラブレターを出したり、男の話に夢中になる級友たちが、つまらないものに思えて、サボる日が續いた。本當の孤独がほしかったのだ。
　今日も神崎川で、満員電車からはみ出された美代は、ふらふらと堤防の上を歩いて来たのだった。
　堤防の一本道は、ふしぎに人通りがなかった。時折り遠くの鐵橋の上を、鈴なりの電車がボーボーと走つているばかりであつた。
　美代は、カバンからトルストイの〝アンナ・カレーニナ〟を出した。
　それは、良人が自分の家にやとつてあつた家庭教師のフランス婦人と關係したのを、夫人が知つて、この上同棲することは出来ないと宣言したことから、家族や召使いたちにいたるまで、いたたまらないような氣持にかられ、オブロンスキイの家庭の不幸と混乱がはじまるとゆう――書出しにひどく興味をひかされた。そのことに似通った家庭の出来事があったからだつた。ひどいショックを受けた美代は、別人のように急變した。美代は書出しのところを、もう一度読みなおした。そして眼をつぶつて考える。この書出しを良人と夫人を逆に入れかえて見たらどうゆう筋の運びになつたであろうか……と。夫人が、子供たちの家庭教師の學生と關係しているのを、良人が発見したとしたら……あゝいやだ。そんなことは、もう思うまい。讀むまい。どうでもなるがいい。美代は、本をなげだして、青草の斜面を、とろとろと轉びはじめた。加速度的にスピードが加わつて、もう止めようと思つても、とまらなかつた深い深い淵へ、落ちて行くような誘惑だつた。スカートがまくれ白い豊かな胴体が、くるくると廻轉して、水涸れの砂丘にどさりと衝突した。眼が廻つた。仰向けになつたまま、美代は動かなかつた。
　意識を回復して、眼を開きらとしたが、まぶしい光線のため、あけることが出来なかつた。やつとうつら眼を開いた。ぎよつとした。男が見下して、じつと見ている。男のあらい息づかいが感じられる。ドキドキと心臓がたぎり立つた、美代は、スカートの亂れが氣になつたが、動くことが出来なかつた。死んだように、ひつくりかえまつたまでつた。男の眼は、一鮎にこけついてまだ動かない真珠のような肉体は、じか[に]陽差しを浴びて、ツキツキと疼く[ような]激痛さえ感じていた。
　男が動いた。美代はすば[やく]かわそうとしたが、男は遅か[つた]かぶさるように美代の身体の上にのしかかつて来た。男の体臭とともに灼けつくような唇が、かたく歯を[とじ]じた美代の唇の上に掩いかぶさつてきた。もはや上半身は男の強い腕でしぼられ、二本の肢だけが、むやみに、宙に舞い狂つているのが、美代の全力的な抵抗だつた。
　男の手がゆるみ、胸の壓迫感が消えると、美代は矢庭に起き立つて續けさまに、男の頰をなぐつた。
「馬鹿、馬鹿、馬鹿……」
　男の頰、まつ赤になつた。手がしびれて来た、打ちやめると、美代は男の胸にしがみついて、よいと泣きはじめた。
「すまなかつた。許しておくれ、僕の意志では、自制できなかつたんた。」
　男は、白線のある學生帽を、にぎつたままの手で、美代の肩を、軽く、やさしく抱きしめようとした。
「うそつき、馬鹿、不良學生……」
　狂氣のやうに叫びながら、美代は堤防をよじのぼり、一本道を夢中で走つた。

　　二、誘惑の觸手

　美代は、阪急百貨店の書籍部で、雑誌の立読みをしていた。かたわらで、ひとりの新制中學の一年生が、マンガの本に読みふけつている。ときおり、聲を立て、笑いながら、夢中になつて、頁をめくつている。そのリンゴのように、幸福そうな横顔をながめていた美代はふと顔を近づけて小聲で言つた。
「あんた、學校をサボつたんでしよう。」
「うん。」
「なぜ、そんなことするの。」
「それは、おまえが、しつてるだろ。いつもサボつてるくせして……」
　美代は、逆襲されて顔をあからめた。
「おれ、おまえを、よく知つてるよきのう、梅田劇場の看板見てたろう、その前も西宮のプロ野球見てたろう。」
「そう、その通りだわ、それであんた、どうしてサボるの。」
「それは、おまえがしつてるツて、いつてるではないか。」
「でも、わたしと、あんたは年も違うし、生活も違うでしょう。」
「おもしろくないからさ。」
　色彩のない索漠たる教室、生活に追われ、ガサガサの感情で教壇に立つている先生たちへの愛情を失った學生、生徒の群れは、勝手に街々に教室をもとめて、さまよい歩いた。それは西宮球場であり、阪急百貨店であり、街の映畫劇場であり、寶塚の場合も、そうであつた。
「やつぱり同じだわ。」
「それ見ろ。」
「でも、すこし違うわ。」
「いつて見ろ。」
「いえないわ。」
「失禮だらう。」
「馬鹿、この子生意氣な。」
　美代は、小さな中學生の肩を、きゆうとつねつた。
「あいたツ。」
　中學生が、いきなりとんきような聲をあげたので、附近の群れの眼が美代にきた。美代は逃げようとしたそのときだつた。うしろから美代の肩を叩くものがあつた。ぴクツとした。

やあと拍手したり、いやに臆病なくせに、ラブレターを出したり、男の話に夢中になる級友たちが、つまらないものに思えて、サボる日が続いた。本当の孤独が欲しかったのだ。
　今日も神崎川で、満員電車からはみ出された美代は、ふらふらと堤防の上を歩いて来たのだった。
　堤防の一本道は、不思議に人通りがなかった。時折遠くの鉄橋の上を、鈴なりの電車がボーボーと走っているばかりであった。
　美代は、カバンからトルストイの『アンナ・カレーニナ』を出した。
　それは、主人が自分の家に雇ってあった家庭教師のフランス婦人と関係したのを、夫人が知って、この上同棲することは出来ないと宣言したことから、家族や召使いたちにいたるまで、いたたまらないような気持ちに駆られ、オブロンスキーの家庭の不幸と混乱が始まると言う――書き出しにひどく興味を惹かれた。そのことに似通った家庭の出来事があったからだった。ひどいショックを受けた美代は、別人のように急変した。美代は書き出しのところを、もう一度読み直した。そして目をつぶって考える。この書き出しを主人と夫人を逆に入れ替えてみたらどういう筋の運びになったであろうか……と。夫人が、子供たちの家庭教師の学生と関係しているのを、主人が発見したとしたら……ああ嫌だ。そんなことは、もう思うまい。読むまい。どうにでもなればいい。美代は、本を投げ出して、青草の斜面を、とろとろと転び始めた。加速度的にスピードが加わって、もう止めようと思っても、止まらなかった。深い深い淵へ、落ちて行くような誘惑だった。スカートがまくれ白い豊かな胴体が、くるくると回転して、水涸れの砂丘にどさりと衝突した。目が回った。仰向けになったまま、美代は動かなかった。

　男が動いた。美代は素早くかわそうとしたが、男は速かった。かぶさるように美代の身体の上にのしかかって来た。男の体臭とともに灼けつくような唇が、固く歯を閉じた美代の唇の上に覆いかぶさってきた。もはや上半身は男の強い腕で絞られ、二本の足だけが、むやみに、宙に舞い狂っているのが、美代の全力的な抵抗だった。
　男の手が緩み、胸の圧迫感が消えると、美代は矢庭に起き立って続けざまに、男の頬を殴った。
「馬鹿、馬鹿、馬鹿……」

「そう、その通りだわ、それであんた、どうしてサボるの。」
「それは、お前が知ってるって、言ってるではないか。」

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

Clapping "ya-to," even though being strangely cowardly, sending love letters, the classmates who become absorbed in talk of men, to [her] became boring things, and skipping days continued. True solitude was what she wanted.
Today also at Kanzaki River, Michiyo, who was squeezed out from a packed train, swaying, came walking on top of the levee.
The one-path of the levee, strangely there was no through-traffic. Occasionally on the distant iron bridge, only trains like hanging bells went "bo-bo" running.
Michiyo, from [her] bag, took out Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina."
That, the master [husband] with the home teacher French woman he had hired in his own house had a relationship, the wife knew [this], from declaring that living together further cannot be done, to the family and servants, driven by a feeling like being unable to stay, the unhappiness and chaos of Oblonsky's household begins—at the opening [she] was terribly interested. Because there were household events similar to that. Michiyo, who received a terrible shock, like a different person suddenly changed. Michiyo, the opening part, once more read over. And closing eyes, thinks. If this opening, the master and wife were reversely swapped and seen, what kind of plot development would it have become... she thought. If the wife, with the student home teacher of the children has a relationship, and the master discovered it... ah, no. Such things, [I] shall think no more. Shall read no more. Let happen whatever will. Michiyo, throwing the book away, the green grass slope, "toro-toro" [dizzily/slowly] began to tumble. Acceleratingly speed added, even if thinking to stop, it didn't stop, like a deep, deep abyss, falling into was the temptation. Skirt rolled up, white rich torso, spinning round and round, against the water-withered sand dune "dosari" [with a thud] collided. Eyes spun. Remaining facing upward, Michiyo did not move.
Regaining consciousness, [she] tried to open eyes, but because of dazzling light rays, could not open. Finally faintly opened eyes. Was startled. A man is looking down, staring. The man's rough breathing is felt. Doki-doki [heart pounding] the heart boiled up. Michiyo, the skirt's disarray was a concern, but could not move. Like being dead, was just turned over. The man's eyes, fixed on one point not moving, the pearl-like flesh, directly bathed in sunlight, even a "tsuki-tsuki" [stabbing] aching sharp pain was felt.
The man moved. Michiyo quickly tried to dodge, but the man was fast. Like covering, onto Michiyo's body [he] came leaning. Along with the man's body odor, parching lips, onto Michiyo's lips which tightly closed teeth, came covering. Already the upper body by the man's strong arms was squeezed, only two limbs, aimlessly, in the air dancing wildly, was Michiyo's full-power resistance.
The man's hands loosened, when the pressure feeling of the chest disappeared, Michiyo suddenly stood up and in succession, the man's cheek struck.
"Idiot, idiot, idiot..."
The man's cheek, became bright red. Hands became numb. When stopping striking, Michiyo clung to the man's chest, and "yoi" [wauling] began to cry.
"I am sorry. Please forgive me, by my will, I could not self-control."
The man, while grasping a student cap with white lines, with that hand, Michiyo's shoulder, lightly, gently tried to embrace.
"Liar, idiot, delinquent student..."
While shouting like madness, Michiyo climbed up the levee, and the one-path in a trance ran.

    II. Tentacles of Temptation

Michiyo, at the Hankyu Department Store book section, was standing-reading a magazine. At the side, one new-system middle school first-year, in a manga book was absorbed in reading. Occasionally, making a voice, while laughing, in a trance, is turning pages. At that apple-like, happy-looking profile Michiyo who was gazing, suddenly brought her face close and in a small voice said.
"You, you skipped school, didn't you."
"Yeah."
"Why, do you do such a thing."
"That, you know, right. Even though you are always skipping..."
Michiyo, being counter-attacked, turned her face red.
"I, know you well. Yesterday, you were looking at the Umeda Theater signboard, weren't you; before that too, you were watching Nishinomiya pro-baseball, weren't you."
"Yes, that is exactly right, so then you, why do you skip."
"That, I'm saying you know, aren't I."
"But, I and you, ages are different, and life is different, right."
"Because it's not interesting."
Classrooms with no color and desolate, driven by life, students who lost affection for teachers standing on the platform with scratchy emotions, the crowd of pupils, at will seeking classrooms in the various streets, wandered. That was Nishinomiya Stadium, it was Hankyu Department Store, it was the city's movie theaters, in the case of Takarazuka too, it was so.
"After all, it's the same."
"See there."
"But, it's a little different."
"Try saying it."
"I can't say it."
"That would be rude, wouldn't it."
"Idiot, this cheeky kid."
Michiyo, the small middle schooler's shoulder, "kyu" [tightly] pinched.
"Ouch."
Because the middle schooler suddenly raised a frantic voice, the eyes of the nearby crowd came to Michiyo. It was the moment Michiyo tried to flee. From behind, there was something that tapped Michiyo's shoulder. She jumped.

## 4️⃣ Literary Translation

Disillusioned by her classmates—who clapped excitedly at trifles, sent timid love letters, and gossiped endlessly about boys—Michiyo had begun a streak of playing truant. What she craved was true solitude.
Today, she had been spat out from a packed train at the Kanzaki River and found herself wandering aimlessly along the top of the levee.
The narrow path atop the embankment was strangely deserted. Only occasionally, on the distant iron bridge, could she see trains packed to the gills rattling past with a hollow roar.
Michiyo pulled a copy of Tolstoy’s *Anna Karenina* from her bag.
She had been captivated by the opening: the description of the Oblonsky household falling into ruin and chaos after the wife discovered her husband’s affair with their French governess—a situation that made life unbearable for the entire family. The story resonated with her because of similar turmoil in her own home. The shock had transformed her, making her feel like a different person. She re-read the opening once more and closed her eyes, wondering: what would happen if the roles of the husband and wife were reversed? If the husband discovered the wife having an affair with a young male tutor... The thought was repulsive. *No, I won't think of it. I won't read anymore. Let happen what may.* Michiyo tossed the book aside and began to roll down the grassy slope. She gained speed uncontrollably; it was like the temptation of falling into a bottomless abyss. Her skirt flew up, exposing her pale, supple torso as she spun, eventually crashing into a dry sandbank with a heavy thud. Her head swam. She lay there on her back, motionless.
When she regained consciousness and tried to open her eyes, the glaring sunlight blinded her. Finally, she managed a squint. She gasped. A man was standing over her, staring down. She could feel his ragged breath. Her heart hammered in her chest. She was conscious of her disarrayed skirt, but she was paralyzed. She lay there as if dead. The man’s gaze was fixed unblinkingly on her pearl-like skin, which stung with a sharp, prickling pain under the direct sun.
Suddenly, the man moved. Michiyo tried to dodge, but he was too fast. He lunged, pinning her down. His musky scent filled her nose as his parching lips pressed hard against her own tightly clenched teeth. Her upper body was crushed by his powerful arms; her only resistance was her legs, kicking wildly and helplessly in the air.
When his grip finally loosened and the weight left her chest, Michiyo sprang up and slapped him across the face, again and again.
"You idiot! Idiot! Idiot!"
His cheek turned bright red. Her hand went numb. When she finally stopped hitting him, she collapsed against his chest and began to sob uncontrollably.
"I’m sorry," he whispered. "Please forgive me. I just... I couldn't help myself."
The man, still clutching a student cap with its tell-tale white band, reached out and tried to pull her into a gentle embrace.
"Liar! Moron! You're nothing but a delinquent!"
Shouting like a madwoman, Michiyo scrambled back up the levee and ran down the path as fast as her legs would carry her.

**II. Tentacles of Temptation**

Michiyo was browsing magazines in the book department of the Hankyu Department Store. Beside her, a young boy—a first-year student under the new school system—was engrossed in a comic book. He laughed out loud every so often as he eagerly turned the pages. Watching his happy, apple-cheeked profile, Michiyo leaned in and whispered, "You're playing hooky, aren't you?"
"Yeah."
"Why would you do that?"
"You know why. You're always doing it yourself..."
Michiyo blushed at the counter-attack.
"I know all about you. I saw you looking at the movie posters at the Umeda Theater yesterday, and I saw you at the pro-baseball game in Nishinomiya before that."
"Fine, you caught me. But why are *you* skipping?"
"I told you, you already know."
"But we're different ages, and we lead different lives."
"Because school is boring," he replied simply.
In those days, students had lost all affection for their teachers—weary souls who stood at the front of bleak, colorless classrooms, hardened by the daily grind. So, the children sought their own classrooms in the streets. They wandered through the Nishinomiya Stadium, the Hankyu Department Store, the movie houses, and the theaters of Takarazuka.
"I guess it's the same for both of us," she mused.
"See? I told you."
"But... it's a little different for me."
"How so?"
"I can't say."
"That's not very fair."
"Be quiet, you little brat!"
Michiyo gave the boy's shoulder a sharp pinch.
"Ow!"
The boy let out such a startled yelp that the people nearby turned to stare. Just as Michiyo turned to make her escape, she felt a tap on her shoulder. She froze.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout and Structure:** The text is arranged in a standard vertical orientation (*tate-gaki*), common for Japanese literature. It is divided into two main columns per page.
*   **Typography:** The font is a traditional Mincho style, likely set via lead type. The presence of *furigana* (reading aids) is minimal, suggesting an audience of adults or older teenagers. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The section break "二、誘惑の觸手" (2. Tentacles of Temptation) uses a larger, slightly bolder font and is centered with whitespace above and below to denote a transition in the narrative.
*   **Punctuation:** The text uses Japanese quotation marks (「 」), repetition marks (〃), and emphasis marks (like the dash/long vowel marker). Note the use of "〃" to denote the title of a book (*Anna Karenina*) instead of modern brackets (『 』).
*   **Condition:** The paper shows signs of aging (yellowing/foxing) and a significant tear/crease in the center of the left column, which has obscured some characters (reconstructed in the transcription based on context).

---

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Post-War Era (Late 1940s–1950s):** The mention of the "New-System Middle School" (新制中學) dates this firmly after the 1947 educational reforms. The setting evokes the "Kasutori" culture—named after a cheap shochu—referring to the era's pulp magazines that featured a mix of romance, mild erotica, and social commentary.
*   **Geography (Kansai Focus):** The story is set in the Keihanshin (Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe) area. Specific landmarks mentioned:
    *   **Kanzaki River (神崎川):** A river running through Osaka and Hyogo.
    *   **Hankyu Department Store (阪急百貨店):** A major landmark in Umeda, Osaka.
    *   **Umeda Theater (梅田劇場) and Takarazuka (寶塚):** Famous entertainment districts.
    *   **Nishinomiya Stadium (西宮球場):** A former stadium that hosted professional baseball, emphasizing the post-war baseball boom.
*   **Literary Influence:** The reference to Tolstoy’s *Anna Karenina* highlights the prestige of Western literature among educated Japanese youth of the era. Michiyo’s internal monologue about reversing the gender roles of the affair shows a burgeoning feminist or at least questioning consciousness regarding the "double standard" of infidelity.
*   **The "Sun-Tribe" (Taiyozoku) Influence:** The scene on the levee with the "delinquent student" (不良學生) and the physical aggression bordering on sexual assault was a common trope in *seishun* (youth) novels of the time, reflecting a breakdown of traditional morals and a shift toward more visceral, often nihilistic portrayals of youth.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **サボる (Saboru):** Derived from "sabotage." In this context, it means to skip school or work (playing hooky).
*   **鈴なり (Suzunari):** Lit. "hanging like bells." Refers to people hanging off the outside of overcrowded trains, a common sight in the early post-war years.
*   **滿員電車 (Man'en Densha):** Packed trains. A staple of post-war urban life.
*   **不良學生 (Furyō Gakusei):** Delinquent student. At the time, even minor rebellions against school authority or dress codes (like a crushed cap) labeled one a "delinquent."
*   **新制中學 (Shinsei Chūgaku):** "New-system middle school," established during the US occupation.
*   **立ち読み (Tachiyomi):** Standing and reading in a bookstore without buying—a perennial Japanese cultural habit.
*   **頓狂な聲 (Tonkyō-na koe):** A wild, startled, or out-of-place voice/scream.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **Escapism:** Both Michiyo and the middle schooler are "escaping" (skipping school/life) because they find their environments (packed trains, desolate classrooms) "uninteresting" or "colorless."
*   **Gender and Morality:** Michiyo projects her own family's trauma onto *Anna Karenina*. Her thought experiment about a wife cheating on a husband reflects the changing (and often conflicting) views on female agency and domestic roles in the post-war period.
*   **Eroticism and Violence:** The encounter on the levee is a classic example of "shojo" or "pulp" melodrama, where sexual tension is expressed through physical struggle and sudden emotional shifts (hitting the man, then crying on his chest). 
*   **Urban Despair:** The "colorless, desolate classrooms" and "teachers hardened by life" suggest a society struggling to find meaning or joy after the devastation of war. The youth seek "classrooms" in the hedonism of theaters and department stores instead.

---

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Serial Novel, Popular Magazine Literature (*Taishū Bungaku*).
*   **Thematic Tags:** Post-war Japan, Romance, Melodrama, Youth Rebellion, Infidelity, Escapism, Kansai setting.
