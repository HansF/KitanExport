「『大陸の寒い風にまき上げられる一面の砂烟（さじん）がうす暗い空を更に黄色く陰らせていた。宏大（こうだい）な宮殿がその渦巻く砂のなかに高く聳（そび）えていた。……（中略）……

## 3️⃣ Literal Translation

The slitting of women’s bellies as seen in literature. (Page 18)

◎ This magazine's 100th-issue-surpassing commemorative prize-competition manuscript winning entry ◎

**Appearing in Literature**
**The Slitting of Women’s Bellies**
                Tayama Hiroshi (or Akira)

"The entire surface of sand-smoke (dust), whipped up by the continent's cold wind, was making the dim sky even more yellowly gloomy. A vast palace was towering high within those swirling sands. ... (omission) ...
'Shh!' (or a scolding sound)
A voice like scolding someone was heard solemnly from nowhere, and brocade curtains opened to the left and right, and were smoothly rolled up. At a high place in the center, a man wearing a brocade crown and a yellow robe, with a face looking drunk on sake, was sitting on a couch inlaid with gems. Chiematsu guessed that this must be the King of the Tang people. Beside the king, trailing a long red brocade skirt, was a beautiful woman who seemed like Princess Otohime of the Dragon Palace; with a queen-like arrogant attitude, she was likewise leaning against a gem-inlaid couch. Chiematsu stood on tiptoe and was surprised again; that beau—"

**The Slitting of Women’s Bellies in Literature**
*A Prize-Winning Entry for the 100th Issue Commemorative Contest*
By Hiroshi Tayama

"The biting continental winds whipped up a shroud of dust, casting a sickly yellow gloom over the already dim sky. Within the swirling sands, a colossal palace loomed high. ... (Omitted) ...
'Silence!'
A voice, heavy with the weight of a stern reprimand, resonated from an unknown source. Brocade curtains parted and were drawn upward with a silken rustle. In the center, upon a raised dais, sat a man wearing a brocade crown and robes of imperial yellow. His face was flushed as if with wine as he reclined upon a couch encrusted with jewels. Chiematsu surmised this must be a King of the Tang. Beside the monarch stood a woman of such ethereal beauty she might have been the Dragon Princess herself. Dressed in long, trailing robes of crimson brocade, she leaned against the jeweled couch with a queenly, haughty air. Chiematsu craned his neck, struck once more by her radiant beauty—"

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The page is designed with a classic mid-century literary magazine aesthetic. It features a bold, framed title box shifted to the right, with the main body text flowing vertically from right to left.
*   **Visual Elements:** The most striking feature is the illustration at the top. It shows two Japanese swords (katana) crossed over what appears to be a woman's torso (implied by the patterned kimono/fabric). The dark, jagged ink style suggests violence and shadows, typical of the "ero-guro" (erotic-grotesque) genre.
*   **Typography:** The title uses a large, slightly stylized font. Furigana (reading aids) are used extensively for difficult kanji (e.g., 砂烟, 聳, 鏤, 榻), indicating that while the magazine caters to adults, the vocabulary is intentionally archaic or literary.
*   **Hierarchy:** The page number (18) and a running header are at the top. A vertical sidebar announces the text as a "100th issue celebration contest winner," which gives the content an air of prestige despite its sensationalist title.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Ero-Guro Nansensu:** This text likely dates from the 1950s, a period when "ero-guro" (erotic grotesque) magazines were very popular in Japan. These publications explored themes of deviance, horror, and eroticism, often under the guise of "literary study" or "historical investigation."
*   **Tang Dynasty Fantasy:** The excerpt describes a "King of Tang" (唐人の王様) and "Chinese robes" (袍). This reflects a common trope in Japanese pulp literature where exotic, ancient Chinese settings provided a backdrop for decadent or cruel fantasies.
*   **Princess Otohime:** The mention of "Otohime of the Dragon Palace" (竜宮の乙姫様) refers to the folk legend of Urashima Taro. It is used here as a shorthand for otherworldly, aristocratic beauty.
*   **Contest Culture:** Japanese magazines of this era frequently held "manuscript contests" (懸賞募集) to engage readers and find new, sensational talent. This piece is presented as a "winning entry," suggesting it met the specific tastes of that magazine's editorial board.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **腹裂き (Harasaki):** Literally "belly-slitting." While related to *seppuku* (ritual suicide), *harasaki* in this context often refers to a more violent or forced act, frequently featured in sensationalist or "cruel" (zankoku) literature.
*   **砂烟 (Sajin/Saen):** An older way of writing "sandstorm" or "dust cloud."
*   **錦の帳 (Nishiki no Tobari):** Brocade curtains. A symbol of extreme wealth and imperial luxury.
*   **袍 (Hō):** A formal outer robe worn by nobles and emperors in ancient East Asian courts.
*   **榻 (Gō):** An archaic term for a couch, stool, or throne-like seat.
*   **鏤めた (Chiribameta):** Inlaid or studded (usually with jewels or gold).
*   **驕慢 (Kyōman):** Arrogance or haughtiness.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Voyeuristic Gaze:** The character Chiematsu acts as the reader's proxy, "craning his neck" (伸上って) to peek into a forbidden, opulent world.
*   **Orientalism/Exoticism:** The setting is a dream-like, ancient China (Tang), used to heighten the sense of "otherness" and allow for more extreme content that might feel too transgressive if set in contemporary Japan.
*   **Beauty and Cruelty:** The title promises "belly-slitting," but the text focuses on extreme beauty and luxury. This juxtaposition of the aesthetic and the violent is a hallmark of the genre.
*   **The "Femme Fatale":** The woman is described as "arrogant" and "queenly," suggesting a character type who is either the victim of or the catalyst for the promised violence.
