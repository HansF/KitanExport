**桃色セクション**

**どうぞもう一度**
**永見 隆二**

若い專務の加川氏は少し早口だった。
藤代さんも、相當に器用なタイピストだったが、彼女の指の動きよりも、加川氏の舌の動きの方が時々早くなることがあった。
と、機關銃のようなタイプライターの音が、ぴたと止って、蓄感した藤代さんの顔が加川氏を振り向く、
「あの……どうぞもう一度、今の處を……」
すると加川氏は、默ってもう一度、口速か繰り返す。今度は前の樣にあまり早口ではない。が、それもほんの一寸の間で、いつの間にか再び藤代さんの指を追い抜いてしまう。
藤代さんは、ひどく恐縮して又加川氏を振り向く。
「あの……どうぞもう一度ゆっくり……」
加川氏は、默って齋藤に頷き又口を廻らせる。けれども決して不機嫌の色などは少しも顔に現わすようなことはない。何故ならば、加川氏自身、自分の早口の癖を知っていて、出來ることなら矯正したいとさえ考えていたからである。が、癖というものは、そう簡單に直せるものではない。今度こそは、ゆっくりやろうと思いながら、途端に父側の調子に乗ってしまう。
三度目、四度目まではまだいいが、五度目になると、藤代さんは、一寸泣き出したいような表情をする。頬はバラ色に染まる。それ程に藤代さんは氣が弱いのだ。
「あの……もう一度……」
消え入りそうな聲である。
すると、今度は加川氏の方で藤代さん以上に恐縮してしまう。
「いやあ、すみません。全く僕の早口は、タイピスト泣かせですね」
と言って、てれかくしのよにワザと滑稽そうな笑い方をする。これが毎日繰返されるのである。けれど、藤代さんは、加川氏の人格と手腕を尊敬していたし加川氏の方でも、美しく淑やかな藤代さんに、野心のない好意を寄せていたので、とにかく二人は意氣の合った協力者であった。
ところが近頃、加川氏は、藤代さんに對して、全然今までにない新しい感情を抱くようになった。
藤代さんの冴え〜とした瞳や、オレンジ色のつや〜した頬や、白い襟足を眺める加川氏の瞳は、何處かもの憐ましそうだった。それは、先週の日曜日以来のことである。
一年前前に奥さんを亡くした加川氏は、子供の照子ちゃんと幸夫君を連れて郊外へ出るつもりで家を出たのだが、その途中偶然、省線の驛で藤代さんに出會ったのだった。
藤代さんは、これから一人で映画を觀に行くところだった。
「どうです、映画より、たまには郊外のいい空氣を吸って來ては？」
加川氏の言葉に藤代さんは快く同意した。そして郊外電車の沿線の遊園地で一日を過す内、照子ちゃんと幸夫君はすっかり藤代さんに馴ついてしまった。
藤代さんの方でも、林檎のような頬っぺたをした照子ちゃんと幸夫君に、大へん愛着を感じた樣だった。そして加川氏に始めて見る藤代さんの和服姿に妙な魅惑を感じたのも事實だった。
その翌日から、加川氏の藤代さんに對する感情が變って来た。それに加えて、照子ちゃんや幸夫君も、藤代さんに會いたがって、毎日加川氏に駄々をこねるのであった。
ついに加川氏は、一晩考え抜いた結果、思い切って、藤代さんに結婚を申込んでみる決心をした。が、二人の間には、一寸年齢のひらきもあるし、殊に加川氏は再婚である。
加川氏はいいろ〜と思案しんだが、何とか勇を鼓して或る土曜日の午後、「子供達が是非一度あなたを連れて來て呉れッて言うてるんですが……」
と藤代さんを自宅に誘ってみた。勿論、藤代さんは喜んで従った。
「僕はあなたに對して、こんな申込みをする資格はないかも知れません。でも、あなたが家内になって下されば、子供達もどんなに喜ぶことでしょう」
加川氏は誠意のこもった言葉を盡した。藤代さんは余りに唐突なので、最初は面喰っていたが、紅くなっている計りだったが、
「あたしのような者でよかったら……」
彼女は羞みながら答えた。
「では承知してくれますか？」
と藤代さんの手をとった。そして、いきなり接吻した。それは偸みのよな、瞬く間の出来事だった彼女は驚いて椅子から立ち上った。
「許して下さい。僕つい夢中になって……」
加川氏は狼狽して辯解した。すると藤代さんは、顔を火のように紅くしながら、
「いいえ、いいえどうぞもう一度ゆっくり……」一おわりー

**Pink Section**

**Office Love-Longing Style**
**Please, One More Time**
**Nagami Ryūichi**

Young Executive Mr. Kagawa was a bit fast-talking.
Miss Fujiyo also was a considerably skilled typist, but rather than the movement of her fingers, the movement of Mr. Kagawa's tongue sometimes happened to become faster.
Then, the machine-gun-like typewriter sound suddenly stops, and the flustered Miss Fujiyo's face turns toward Mr. Kagawa.
"Um... please, one more time, that part just now..."
Then Mr. Kagawa, silently one more time, repeats with a fast mouth. This time it is not so fast-talking like before. But, that also is for a mere moment, and before one knows it, he again overtakes Miss Fujiyo's fingers.
Miss Fujiyo, being greatly apologetic, again turns toward Mr. Kagawa.
"Um... please, one more time, slowly..."
Mr. Kagawa silently nods to her and again moves his mouth. However, never does an expression of displeasure appear even a little on his face. If one asks why, Mr. Kagawa himself knows his own fast-talking habit and even thought that if it were possible, he wanted to correct it. But, things called habits are not things that can be fixed so simply. While thinking "this time for sure, let's do it slowly," he immediately gets onto his usual rhythm.
Until the third or fourth time it is still okay, but when it becomes the fifth time, Miss Fujiyo makes an expression like she wants to cry a bit. Her cheeks are dyed rose color. To that extent, Miss Fujiyo is weak-spirited.
"Um... one more time..."
It is a voice likely to fade away.
Then, this time on Mr. Kagawa's side, he becomes more apologetic than Miss Fujiyo.
"Ah, sorry. Truly my fast-talking is a 'typist-killer,' isn't it?"
Saying so, to hide his embarrassment, he intentionally does a comical way of laughing. This is repeated every day. However, Miss Fujiyo respected Mr. Kagawa's character and skill, and on Mr. Kagawa's side too, toward the beautiful and graceful Miss Fujiyo, he held a goodwill without ambition (ulterior motives), so anyway the two were collaborators whose spirits matched.

However, recently, Mr. Kagawa, toward Miss Fujiyo, came to hold a completely new feeling not seen until now.
Looking at Miss Fujiyo's clear eyes, and orange-colored glossy cheeks, and white nape, Mr. Kagawa's eyes were somehow full of longing. That has been since last week's Sunday.
Mr. Kagawa, who lost his wife one year ago, left home intending to go to the suburbs taking his children Teruko-chan and Yukio-kun, but on the way by chance, at the Government Railway station, he met Miss Fujiyo.
Miss Fujiyo was just about to go see a movie by herself.
"How about it, rather than a movie, once in a while coming to breathe the good air of the suburbs?"
To Mr. Kagawa's words, Miss Fujiyo pleasantly agreed. And while spending a day at an amusement park along the suburban train line, Teruko-chan and Yukio-kun completely became attached to Miss Fujiyo.
On Miss Fujiyo's side too, toward Teruko-chan and Yukio-kun who had cheeks like apples, she seemed to feel great affection. And it was also a fact that Mr. Kagawa felt a strange charm in Miss Fujiyo's Japanese clothing (kimono) attire, which he saw for the first time.
From the next day, Mr. Kagawa's feelings toward Miss Fujiyo changed. In addition to that, Teruko-chan and Yukio-kun also wanted to meet Miss Fujiyo and threw tantrums at Mr. Kagawa every day.

Finally, Mr. Kagawa, as a result of thinking through one night, made up his mind to try proposing marriage to Miss Fujiyo. But, between the two, there is a bit of an age gap, and especially Mr. Kagawa is a remarriage.
Mr. Kagawa pondered various things, but somehow plucking up his courage on a certain Saturday afternoon, "The children are saying they definitely want me to bring you over once..."
And so he invited Miss Fujiyo to his home. Of course, Miss Fujiyo followed joyfully.
"I might not have the qualification to make such an application (proposal) to you. But, if you would become the lady of the house, how happy the children would be."
Mr. Kagawa exhausted words filled with sincerity. Miss Fujiyo, because it was too abrupt, at first was taken aback and was only turning red, but,
"If someone like me is okay..."
She answered while being bashful.
"Then, will you consent?"
He took Miss Fujiyo's hand. And, suddenly he kissed her. It was a thing of a blinking moment, like a theft. She was surprised and stood up from her chair.
"Please forgive me. I just became lost in the moment..."
Mr. Kagawa flusteredly apologized. Then Miss Fujiyo, while making her face red like fire,
"No, no, please, one more time, slowly..."
-End-

**The Pink Section**

**An Office Romance: "Please, One More Time"**
**By Nagami Ryūichi**

Mr. Kagawa, a young executive, was a notoriously fast talker. Miss Fujiyo was a highly capable typist, but even her nimble fingers were often outpaced by the speed of Mr. Kagawa’s tongue. 

Suddenly, the machine-gun clatter of the typewriter would cease. A flustered Miss Fujiyo would turn to him and say, "Um... excuse me, but could you please repeat that last part?"

Mr. Kagawa would fall silent and repeat himself, speaking more slowly this time. But the change never lasted. Within moments, his words would again outrun Miss Fujiyo’s typing. Utterly apologetic, she would turn to him once more. "Um... please, sir, one more time... a bit slower?"

Mr. Kagawa would nod silently and resume dictating. He never showed a hint of annoyance. He was well aware of his habit and wished he could break it, but old habits die hard. No matter how much he resolved to take it slow, he would inevitably slip back into his frantic rhythm.

By the third or fourth interruption, things were manageable, but by the fifth, Miss Fujiyo looked ready to burst into tears, her cheeks flushed a deep rose. She was a timid soul. "Um... just one more time..." she would whisper in a voice that seemed ready to vanish.

At this, Mr. Kagawa would become even more embarrassed than she was. "Ah, I’m so sorry! My fast talking really is a typist's nightmare, isn't it?" he would say with a forced, self-deprecating laugh. This was their daily routine. Despite the friction, Miss Fujiyo deeply respected Mr. Kagawa’s character and talent, and Mr. Kagawa held a sincere, innocent affection for the beautiful and graceful Miss Fujiyo. They were a perfectly synchronized team.

Recently, however, Mr. Kagawa’s feelings for Miss Fujiyo had begun to shift. As he gazed at her clear eyes, her glowing cheeks, and the elegant line of her neck, his expression was tinged with a certain longing. It had all started the previous Sunday.

Mr. Kagawa, a widower of one year, had set out for the suburbs with his children, Teruko and Yukio. By pure chance, they ran into Miss Fujiyo at the station. She was on her way to see a movie alone. "Why not skip the movie and come breathe some fresh country air with us?" he suggested.

Miss Fujiyo happily agreed. They spent the day at an amusement park, where the children took to her instantly. Miss Fujiyo, in turn, seemed to adore the apple-cheeked Teruko and Yukio. For Mr. Kagawa’s part, seeing Miss Fujiyo in a traditional kimono for the first time had left him utterly enchanted.

From that day on, he saw her in a different light. To make matters more urgent, the children threw tantrums every day, begging to see her again. After a sleepless night of deliberation, Mr. Kagawa decided to propose. He worried about the age gap and the fact that he was a widower, but on Saturday afternoon, he summoned his courage. "The children are dying to see you again," he told her, inviting her to his home.

Miss Fujiyo accepted gladly. Once there, he bared his soul. "I may not have the right to ask this of you, but if you would become my wife, it would make the children so happy."

His words were filled with sincerity. Taken aback by the suddenness of the proposal, Miss Fujiyo turned bright red. Finally, she whispered shyly, "If someone like me is truly enough for you..."

"Then you accept?" Mr. Kagawa took her hand and gave her a sudden, fleeting kiss. Startled, she leapt from her chair. 

"Forgive me! I... I lost my head," Mr. Kagawa stammered, flustered.

Miss Fujiyo, her face burning like fire, looked at him and said, "No... no... Please... one more time... slowly..."

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Masthead:** The top of the page features a decorative hand-drawn title "桃色セクション" (Peach/Pink Section) encased in a cloud-like scalloped border with small floral or abstract ornaments. This indicates a regular column or section dedicated to light romance or slightly "risqué" (for the era) content.
*   **Typography:** The main title is set in a large, bold font with a slight decorative flair. The author's name follows in smaller type. The body text uses a standard vertical newspaper/magazine font, which is dense but legible.
*   **Layout:** The text is arranged in vertical columns, reading right to left. There is a clear visual break in the center for an illustration.
*   **Illustration:** A line drawing occupies the middle right. It depicts a man in a Western-style suit and a woman in a dress, typical of middle-class urban fashion of the mid-20th century. Their proximity and eye contact suggest the romantic theme of the story.
*   **Paging:** The number "-72-" is centered at the bottom, suggesting this is a feature within a larger magazine.
*   **Overall Tone:** The design is typical of the "Kasutori" or popular entertainment magazines that flourished in Japan during the post-war occupation period. It balances the "modern" (office work, suits, movies) with the "traditional" (kimono mention, marriage values).

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Showa 20s):** The language and setting point to the late 1940s or early 1950s. The mention of "省線" (Shōsen - Government Railway) is a key temporal marker, as it was the precursor to JNR (Japan National Railways).
*   **Office Culture:** The role of the "typist" was a common occupation for young women (*shokugyō fujin*) in the early-to-mid 20th century. It represents the modernization of the Japanese workforce.
*   **Social Class/Status:** The male lead is a "専務" (Executive Director), a high-ranking position, while the female lead is a typist. This "boss/secretary" romance is a classic trope of the era's popular fiction.
*   **Westernization vs. Tradition:** The story mentions Western elements (typewriters, movies, suits) but highlights the moment the male lead falls in love when he sees her in a *kimono* (和服). This reflects a common post-war sentiment: a fascination with Western modernity but a deep-seated appreciation for traditional Japanese beauty.
*   **Post-War Demographics:** Mr. Kagawa is a widower. In the immediate post-war years, remarriage and blended families were common topics due to the high mortality rates of the preceding war years.
*   **"Pink" Content:** The "Pink Section" (*Momoiro Section*) label suggests "soft" erotica or romance. In this context, a "kiss" was considered quite a dramatic and slightly scandalous climax for a popular magazine story.

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **戀慕 (Renbo):** An archaic/literary way of writing "love/attachment." Modern Japanese uses 恋慕.
*   **専務 (Senmu):** Executive director. Indicates high status.
*   **タイピスト (Taipuraisuto):** Typist. A loanword reflecting the modernization of the office.
*   **機関銃 (Kikanjū):** Machine gun. Used metaphorically here to describe the rapid-fire sound of the typewriter.
*   **恐縮 (Kyōshuku):** To feel small/ashamed/sorry. A very common Japanese expression of polite humility.
*   **省線 (Shōsen):** Abbreviation for "Government Railway Line." Use of this term mostly disappeared after 1949 when JNR was established.
*   **面喰う (Menkurau):** To be flustered or taken aback.
*   **接吻 (Seppun):** An older word for "kiss." Modern Japanese almost exclusively uses the loanword "kisu."
*   **どうぞもう一度 (Dōzo mō ichido):** The titular phrase. It is used as a "punchline" (ochiru), shifting from a professional request for clarity to a romantic request for another kiss.

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The "Punchline" Structure:** The story is built around a linguistic repetition. The phrase "Please, one more time, slowly," which was previously a source of embarrassment and professional stress for the typist, is repurposed at the end as a bold romantic invitation. This is a classic "Rakugo"-style narrative structure applied to a modern romance.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The man is the active, fast-paced "motor" of the office, while the woman is the passive receiver who tries to keep up. However, in the end, she gains agency by using his own "mistake" (the impulsive kiss) to demand more.
*   **Family Values:** The children (Teruko and Yukio) serve as a bridge for the romance. Their approval makes the marriage seem "moral" and "necessary" rather than just a product of lust, which was important for the social mores of the time.
*   **Innocence:** Despite the "Pink Section" branding, the story is remarkably innocent. The climax is a single, fleeting kiss. The "sexiness" comes from the subtext of the typist asking for a repeat of that physical intimacy.

## 9️⃣ Content Tags & Classification Flags

*   **Content Type:** Fiction, Short Story, Romance.
*   **Thematic Tags:** Office Romance, Post-war Japan, Widower, Marriage, Workplace Dynamics, Humor, Melodrama.
*   **Classification:** Popular Literature (Taishū Bungaku), Kasutori Magazine style.
