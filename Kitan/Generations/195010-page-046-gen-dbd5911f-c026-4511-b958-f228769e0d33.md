ハテ？どこへやったかしら？
エイ、これこれ

**夫のへそくり**

社の歸りに酔つぱらつて行つたパン宿の女が忘れられなかつた。女は彼の妻君の持たないテクニックを数多く持つていたからだつた。
そこで彼はもう一度あの女のところへ行つてみたいとそればかり考えていたのである。
しかし給料袋のまゝ妻君に渡す習慣になつている彼は五百円の金をさえ捻出することが出来なかつた。そこで毎月の煙草代の中から少しづゝ節約して、本の頁の間にはさんでかくしておいた
三ヶ月の後、彼は遂に五百円の金を溜めることが出来た。
そこで土曜日の晩、いよ〜探険と思つて本を取り出してみると、はて不思議、虎の子よりも尚大切な五百円が紛失してしまつているのである。
彼はすつかり悲観した。勿論細君が掃除の際発見してとつた事は明らかだが、後暗い金であるからして、聞き糺す訳にはいかないのであつた。
彼は又引続いて三ヶ月煙草を節約しなければならないのだ。
さて彼の細君、御亭主の贖くりを発見していさゝか憤慨したが、どうせ見つけたからには、私のものだとゆう気持になつた。美しい帯や着物とまではゆかなくとも、百貨店の食堂の誘惑が彼女を待つていた。
癪だから、夫が出社してから、三越へでも行つて、美味しいものでも食べてこよう、（おゝ、それはなんといじらしい復讐だろう）
細君はいろ〜とかくし処を考えた果、その百円札五枚を夫に奪い返えされぬように新聞紙に包んで、下駄箱の隅にかくしたのだ。
こうしておけば紙屑としか思えぬだろう。
さて三日の後、彼女は街へ出ようと思つて盛装をこらして下駄を出し、さて、大切の五百円を探すと、あら！、不思議や、何時の間にかその金は消えてしまつているのだ。彼女は、なかば泣き出しそうになつて、隅から隅まで探したのだが、影も形もあらばこそ……。
遂に大枚五百円は行方不明。
細君とても、後暗い金、誰に聞くわけにも、ゆかなかつた。
細君の弟で、新制大学に通つている学生がアルバイトをしながら居候をしていた。
彼は、ふと下駄箱に五百円の大金を見つけて、欣々然として街の女の所へとんで行つたのである。勿論その金は、捜索さるべき性質の金でないことを、彼はよく承知していた。
――金とゆうやつは、やつぱり女のために使わるべきものらしいですね。

**Modern Amorous Humorous Performance Score**
**The Value of 500 Yen**
**By Hissei Muotsu**

(Illustration captions)
"Huh? Where did I put it?"
"Hey, this is it."

**The Husband's Secret Stash**

The woman at the bread-inn (pan-yado) he went to while drunk on the way home from the company could not be forgotten. It was because the woman possessed many techniques his wife did not have.
Therefore, he was thinking only of wanting to go to that woman's place once more.
However, because he was in the habit of handing over his salary envelope as-is to his wife, he could not even produce the sum of 500 yen. Therefore, by saving little by little from his monthly cigarette money, he hid it by sandwiching it between the pages of a book.
After three months, he finally was able to save the sum of 500 yen.
Then, on a Saturday evening, thinking "finally the expedition," he took out the book, and lo, a wonder, the 500 yen more precious than a tiger's cub (one's most precious possession) had gone missing.
He was completely pessimistic. Of course, it was clear the wife found and took it during cleaning, but because it was "behind-dark" (guilty) money, he could not ask and cross-examine her.
He had to continue saving cigarette money for another three months.

As for his wife, discovering her husband's stash made her somewhat indignant, but since she found it anyway, she felt "it is mine." Though it wouldn't stretch to a beautiful obi or kimono, the temptation of the department store dining hall awaited her.
Being annoyed, she thought, "After my husband goes to work, I'll go to Mitsukoshi and eat something delicious" (Oh, what a touching revenge that is).
The wife, after thinking of various hiding places, wrapped those five 100-yen bills in newspaper and hid them in the corner of the shoe cupboard so the husband wouldn't take them back.
"If I do this, he'll only think it's scrap paper."
Three days later, intending to go to town, she dressed up grandly and took out her clogs (geta), and when she searched for the important 500 yen—Oh! Wonder!—before she knew it, the money had vanished. She almost started crying and searched from corner to corner, but there wasn't a shadow or form of it...
Finally, the large sum of 500 yen was missing.
Even for the wife, it was "behind-dark" money; she couldn't ask anyone about it.

The wife's younger brother, a student attending a new-system university, was staying as a dependent while working a part-time job.
He accidentally found the large sum of 500 yen in the shoe cupboard and, full of joy, flew off to the woman of the streets. Of course, he knew well that this was not the kind of money that would be searched for.
—It seems money is a thing that ought to be used for women after all, isn't it?

**Modern Tales of Humorous Desire**
**The Worth of Five Hundred Yen**
**By Hissei Muotsu**

**The Secret Stash**

He couldn't get her out of his mind—that woman at the "bread-inn" he’d stumbled into, drunk, on his way home from work. She possessed a repertoire of techniques his wife simply didn't have. He thought of nothing else but finding a way back to her.
But he was a man of habit, handing his entire pay envelope over to his wife every month, and couldn't scrape together even five hundred yen. He began siphoning off a bit of his cigarette allowance each month, tucking the bills between the pages of a book. After three months, he finally reached his goal.
One Saturday evening, ready for his "expedition," he reached for the book. To his horror, the money—more precious to him than his own life—was gone. He was devastated. It was obvious his wife had found it while cleaning, but since it was "dirty" money, he couldn't exactly confront her about it. He faced another three months of meager smoking.

The wife, for her part, had been livid when she found the stash, but she quickly decided that finders were keepers. It wasn't enough for a fine silk kimono or a sash, but the luxury of a department store restaurant was calling her name.
Out of spite, she decided that once her husband left for the office, she would head to Mitsukoshi for a gourmet feast. (Oh, what a quaint little act of revenge!) To ensure her husband didn't steal it back, she wrapped the five hundred-yen notes in newspaper and tucked them into a dusty corner of the shoe cabinet, figuring he’d take it for mere trash.
Three days later, she dressed in her finest to head into town. She stepped to the cabinet to get her sandals and reached for her treasure. Lo and behold! The money had vanished into thin air. She searched every nook and cranny, nearly in tears, but there was no sign of it. The five hundred yen was gone. Like her husband, she couldn't breathe a word to anyone, as the money wasn't rightfully hers to begin with.

Meanwhile, the wife's younger brother—a student at one of the new universities living in their house—had happened upon the bundle in the shoe cabinet. Overjoyed by his luck, he immediately dashed off to visit a lady of the night. He knew perfectly well that no one would dare report this particular sum of money as stolen. 
It seems that money, after all, is destined to be spent on women.

## 5️⃣ Editorial Analysis

*   **Layout:** The text is organized in traditional Japanese vertical columns (*tate-gaki*), reading from top to bottom, right to left. 
*   **Typography:** The title uses a bold, stylized brush-stroke font typical of mid-century magazines. The body text is a standard serif-like typeface. 
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The main story title "五百圓の價値" is the largest element, followed by the series title "現代艶笑狂演譜." Section headers like "夫のへそくり" (The Husband's Secret Stash) are bolded to divide the narrative.
*   **Illustrations:** Three hand-drawn cartoons accompany the text. 
    1.  Top right: A woman (the wife) looking confused, then finding the money. 
    2.  Bottom left: A man (the student brother) looking suspicious/curious near the shoe cabinet.
    3.  A woman in a kimono, likely the "Luriko" mentioned in the second half.
*   **Column Structure:** The page is split into a main story and a secondary piece ("遊閑令嬢行状記" - Record of a Leisurely Young Lady's Conduct) which includes a mock classified ad.

## 6️⃣ Cultural Notes & Historical Context

*   **Era (Post-War 1940s-1950s):** The mention of "New-system university" (*Shinsei Daigaku*) dates this post-1949. The currency value (500 yen) was significant at the time—equivalent to roughly $30-$50 in modern purchasing power, but a large portion of a monthly salary in the cash-strapped post-war era.
*   **Pan-yado (パン宿):** Literally "bread inn." This was a euphemism for illegal brothels or rooms where "pan-pan girls" (prostitutes catering to both locals and occupation GIs) operated. The "bakery" front was common.
*   **Kasu-tori Culture:** This text likely comes from a *kasu-tori* magazine. These were cheap, pulp magazines printed on low-quality paper that focused on "3S" (Sex, Screen, Sports) and "Ero-Guro-Nansensu" (Erotic-Grotesque-Nonsense).
*   **Department Store Dining:** Going to a department store like Mitsukoshi to eat was a major middle-class luxury and a status symbol for housewives in the post-war recovery period.
*   **Gender Dynamics:** The story reflects a classic trope of the "salaryman" husband hiding money for illicit pleasures and the "strong" or "shrewd" housewife who controls the finances, a dynamic often played for laughs in *rakugo* and popular fiction.

---

## 7️⃣ Lexical Notes

*   **へそくり (Hesokuri):** Secret savings, usually kept by a housewife, but here used by the husband.
*   **虎の子 (Tora no ko):** "Tiger's cub"—an idiom for one's most precious, carefully guarded possession/savings.
*   **後ろ暗い (Ushiro-gurai):** Shady, guilty, or dishonorable. Because the money was intended for/sourced from illicit activity, neither party can complain when it's stolen.
*   **欣々然 (Kinkin-zen):** To be gleeful or full of joy.
*   **桃花ホテル (Tōka hoteru):** "Peach Blossom Hotel"—a euphemism for a love hotel or a place for trysts.
*   **アベック (Abekku):** From the French *avec* ("with"). In post-war Japan, it specifically referred to a romantic couple.

---

## 8️⃣ Themes & Subtext

*   **The Irony of Vice:** The story follows a "circle of karma." The husband's "bad" money is stolen by the wife for her own "selfish" desires, which is then stolen by the student for his own "vice." Because everyone’s motive is slightly immoral, no one can seek justice.
*   **Economic Desperation vs. Small Luxuries:** The narrative highlights the post-war struggle to find joy (tobacco, a good meal, a "rendezvous") in an economy where 500 yen takes three months to save.
*   **Satire of Modernity:** The mention of the "New-system university" student suggests a satirical view of the youth of the time—using their "modern education" and part-time status to facilitate the same old vices as the older generation.
*   **Gender Rivalry:** The "touching revenge" of the wife is framed as a domestic power struggle where the bathroom or the kitchen (or in this case, the shoe cabinet) becomes a battlefield.
